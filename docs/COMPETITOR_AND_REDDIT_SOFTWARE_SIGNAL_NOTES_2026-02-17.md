# Competitive & Reddit Signal Notes (Studio Operations Focus)
Date: 2026-02-17

## Competitor scan (focus: studio operations, not classes/workshops/stores)

### Pottery Pass
- Positioning: full studio operations with piece-level tracking and workflow stages.
- Relevant signals:
  - Digital piece tracking IDs and end-to-end stage movement.
  - Auto notifications for status transitions.
  - Flexible workflow customization (greenware → dry → bisque → glaze → final etc.).

### Classly
- Positioning: class and membership-heavy studio management.
- Relevant signals:
  - Membership and class registration workflow automation.
  - Wheel/workspace reservations and member self-serve booking.
  - Integrated communication and booking forms.
- Note: while class-heavy, reservation and access-management model may transfer to studio operations modules.

### Kilnfox
- Positioning: pottery-specific, lifecycle-heavy tracking.
- Relevant signals:
  - Explicit drying/firing/pickup progression.
  - Customer-facing status visibility and pickup scheduling.
  - Cloud-first operational consolidation.

### Ceramics / pottery ecosystem mentions (Kiln Watch / SmartKiln)
- Positioning around kiln telematics and status telemetry.
- Relevant signals:
  - Real-time kiln updates and alerts.
  - Schedule synchronization and schedule/state visibility.
- Note: could inform status model and alert taxonomy.

## Reddit signal notes (r/Ceramics / r/Pottery)

### Data continuity and trust
- Multiple threads mention concern around apps disappearing, broken backups, and portability.
- Pain point: users need confidence that their project history, notes, and photos will persist.

### Mobile/platform parity
- Recurrent request for reliable iOS/Android behavior and cross-device access.

### Operational noise / communication fatigue
- Repeated mention of “when will it be done?” and admin overhead in status updates.
- Indicates high user value for clear ETA windows, automation, and status transparency.

### Adoption barriers
- Concern over change management in established studios (especially legacy workflows and older users).
- Suggestion: onboarding path should be simple, with staged rollout and coachable defaults.

## Prioritized product implications

1. Make status semantics unambiguous and auditable.
2. Treat communication as core feature, not optional integration.
3. Reduce manual board maintenance.
4. Provide migration and backup assurances for long-lived records.
