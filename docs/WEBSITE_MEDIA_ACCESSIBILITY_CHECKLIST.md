# Website Media Accessibility Checklist

## Scope
- Applies to all new or updated media on `website/` with spoken content.
- Covers video embeds, hosted video, reels, and audio snippets.

## Required Before Publish
1. Captions are present and accurate for spoken words.
2. Speaker labels are included when multiple voices matter.
3. Transcript is available for long-form media (about 60 seconds or longer).
4. Any audio-only instruction has a visible text equivalent nearby.
5. No media autoplays with sound.
6. Critical updates are never communicated by audio-only cues.

## Quality Bar
- Captions reflect meaning, not just rough keywords.
- Transcript includes key actions, outcomes, and references mentioned in the media.
- Captions and transcript are reviewed by a second person for high-impact pages.

## Placement Rules
- Captions: on-player (closed captions) or burned in when required by channel.
- Transcript: linked directly below the media or on a clearly named sibling page.
- Label transcript links with explicit text, for example: `Read transcript`.

## Fast QA Pass
1. Play media muted and confirm full understanding using captions/transcript.
2. Confirm transcript link is reachable by keyboard.
3. Confirm transcript renders on mobile without horizontal scroll.
4. Confirm no layout shift hides caption controls.

## Exceptions
- No exceptions for speech media on public pages.
- If a temporary gap exists, do not publish until captions/transcript are complete.

## Ownership
- Content owner is responsible for checklist completion.
- Website owner signs off before publishing media to production.
