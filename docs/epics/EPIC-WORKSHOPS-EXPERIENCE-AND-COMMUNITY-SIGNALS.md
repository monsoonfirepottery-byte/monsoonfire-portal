## Problem

The Workshops page is functional but feels flat and transactional. It does not yet capture enough community energy, interest demand, or social learning momentum to grow participation.

## Objective

Evolve Workshops from a simple signup surface into a community learning hub that drives discovery, demand signaling, and member connection.

## Scope

1. Discovery and recommendation layers for workshops.
2. Structured workshop request intake and demand routing.
3. Community-building signals and participation loops.
4. Technique learning pathways, including cross-links from Lending.
5. Frontend UX pass for responsiveness, clarity, and delight.
6. Staff programming intelligence tools from member demand data.

## Brainstorm Backlog (Prioritized for Ticketing)

1. Workshop requests by technique, medium, level, and preferred schedule.
2. "I'm interested" signals before signup opens.
3. Waitlist momentum and "open second session" recommendation.
4. Member buddy mode (find peers taking the same workshop).
5. Instructor/staff featured path: "If you liked this workshop, take this next."
6. Technique-to-workshop pathway from Lending and from workshop detail pages.
7. Community showcase feed for outcomes from prior workshops.
8. Alumni reflections and practical "what I wish I knew" tips.
9. Local cohort circles (small accountability groups around techniques).
10. Post-workshop continuation prompts (book + practice + next class suggestion).

## Tasks

1. Define workshop discovery and recommendation contracts.
2. Define and ship workshop request intake model and staff triage path.
3. Define and ship community signal events and member-facing UI.
4. Implement technique-learning pathway integration with Lending and workshop detail.
5. Execute frontend interaction and storytelling pass.
6. Build staff-facing demand intelligence panel for programming decisions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Members can discover relevant workshops through curated and dynamic rails.
2. Members can submit workshop requests with structured intent data.
3. Community signals (interest, waitlist momentum, outcomes) are captured and surfaced.
4. Technique links work bidirectionally between Lending content and Workshops.
5. Staff can review demand clusters and convert them into workshop planning actions.
6. Workshops UX feels materially more interactive, social, and actionable.
