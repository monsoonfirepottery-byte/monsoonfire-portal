## Purpose

To describe how people with disabilities can request accessible support and media accommodations.

## Scope

Physical studio access, website interactions, and portal communication.

## Policy

- People needing accessibility support should contact the studio support address with preferred
  format and assistive needs.
- Staff will communicate and, where feasible, adjust communication format (email threads, clear
  labels, alternative channels).
- Accessibility requests for media, forms, or appointments are handled with reasonable
  accommodation efforts.

## Implementation in portal

- Keep contact paths visible and accessible.
- Use clear labels, heading structure, and concise instructions in support and policy surfaces.
- Route accommodation requests to staff queue for follow-up in writing.

## Support language

Use language that is:

- direct
- explicit about accommodation timeline
- clear about interim alternatives if immediate change is not available
