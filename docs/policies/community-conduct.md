## Purpose

To preserve a respectful and focused environment for studio production.

## Scope

All community interactions in-person, workshop sessions, and written support channels.

## Policy

- Maintain shared-space etiquette: tidy, respectful, and focused use.
- Harassment, discrimination, or unsafe interruption of others is not permitted.
- Keep noise and tool usage compatible with studio workflow.
- Any escalations are documented and may result in access restrictions.

## Implementation in portal

- Link this policy in community and support surfaces.
- Provide clear escalation path for safety and conduct concerns.

## Enforcement

Repeated or severe conduct issues can trigger written warning, temporary pause, or access lock.

## Support language

Support should include:

- what behavior is being referenced
- immediate steps for de-escalation
- whether mediation or formal review is needed
