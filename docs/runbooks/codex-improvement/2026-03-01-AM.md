# Codex Continuous Improvement 2026-03-01-AM

## Evidence Summary
- Window (primary): last 12h
- Window (rollup): last 24h
- Commits (24h): 16
- CI failures (24h): 15
- Tool failure rate (24h): 0.0%

## What Changed
- Stabilize repeated CI failure signature
- Reduce churn hotspot in scripts/portal-authenticated-canary.mjs
- Stabilize metadata/config churn
- Address skill density spikes with structural guardrails

## Why
- Reduce recurring failures and noisy churn with small, targeted interventions.
- Keep automation evidence-based and reviewable through normal PR flow.

## Risk Assessment
- Scope is constrained to recommendation/ticket/reporting automation.
- No direct pushes to main.
- Loop-prevention and run-id gating are enforced.

## QA Steps
1. Run `node ./scripts/codex/daily-improvement.mjs --dry-run --json`.
2. Confirm no secrets appear in `.codex/toolcalls.ndjson` entries.
3. Verify run heading appended to `.codex/improvement-log.md`.
4. Validate run-id skip by re-running without `--force`.
5. Verify branch name format and labels in created/updated PR.

## Next 12h Focus
- Triage new failure clusters and convert top items into scoped tickets.
- Land low-risk guardrails (lint/test/check scripts) for highest-frequency failures.
- Verify metadata/config churn has explicit owner and rollback notes.
- Address top recommendation first: Stabilize repeated CI failure signature.
- Apply structural guardrail tightening in this run and validate over next 2-3 runs.
