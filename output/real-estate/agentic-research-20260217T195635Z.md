## Suggested Swarm Actions

- Validate listing status and current ask against broker or listing portal.
- Prioritize leads with classification=distress_opportunity for immediate outreach.
- Cross-check top leads against Maricopa Treasurer tax-lien and tax-deed sources before outreach.
- Use parcel-centric public signal context (tax, legal, code, utility, permit, CMBS) to prioritize negotiation order.
- Pull recorder notice + MCSO auction context for leads carrying foreclosure or trustee-sale signals.
- Pull assessor parcel-level history for leads carrying governmentDistressScore > 0.
- Review Phoenix and West Valley permitting/planning feeds for zoning or code signals near shortlisted assets.
- Request rent roll and concessions where price-reduced or vacancy language appears.
- Compare each shortlisted lead against latest quarterly medians before LOI strategy.
- Use macro context (rates + CRE index trend) to bias outreach timing and offer aggressiveness.
- Refresh broker and NAIOP reports monthly to detect vacancy/rent inflections before they hit listing portals.
