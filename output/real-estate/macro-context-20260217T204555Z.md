## Maricopa ACS Snapshot

- population: 4491987
- medianGrossRent: 1587
- medianHomeValue: 414700

## Implications

- If fed funds remain elevated vs 12-month average, prioritize distressed/off-market negotiation postures over competitive bids.
- If CRE index YoY declines, increase watch cadence for tax/legal distress signals and lender-driven dispositions.
- Use ACS rent and value baselines to sanity-check local asking rents against household affordability pressure.
- Prioritize parcels where macro pressure and parcel-level distress signals co-occur.
