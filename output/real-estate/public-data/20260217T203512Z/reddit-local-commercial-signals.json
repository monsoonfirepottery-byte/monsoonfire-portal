          "selftext": "You can feel it in planning meetings this year: budgets are tight, AI is everywhere, and nobody wants another dashboard that eats money without giving clear wins. Teams are juggling UPI notifications, cloud invoices, and “pilot” subscriptions that never graduated. Meanwhile, leadership keeps asking the same thing in different ways-what’s the return? This guide gives you a practical, step-by-step framework to calculate the ROI of AI tools in 2025, with the exact metrics, formulas, and checkpoints that hold up under CFO scrutiny and Reddit-level debate.\n\n# Understanding AI ROI in 2025\n\n**What metrics matter most when evaluating ROI of AI tools?**\n\nStart by splitting ROI into two clean lanes: value created and costs incurred. Value created usually shows up in three forms:\n\n1. **Productivity gains (time saved)**  This is the easiest to model early. Track hours saved per role, per task, and multiply by fully loaded hourly cost. Tie it to **before-and-after** baselines: average handling time (AHT) for support tickets, content turnarounds, code review minutes, lead research time, or data cleaning hours. Make sure the baseline is stable-use at least two weeks of pre-AI data for daily tasks, and four to six weeks for weekly or monthly tasks.  \n2. **Revenue growth (conversion or output improvements)**  If an AI assistant improves copy quality, personalization, search relevance, or recommendation targeting, your value shows up as more demos booked, higher checkout conversion, better upsell acceptance, or higher LTV. You’ll measure **conversion rate uplifts**, **A/B test deltas**, and **per-rep output** (e.g., more qualified emails sent with fewer unsubscribes).  \n3. **Risk and quality improvements (error reduction, compliance, uptime)**  This is where many teams forget to assign value. Fewer data errors, lower PII exposure, faster incident response, better audit trails-all of these have a measurable cost-avoidance value. You can quantify this using **cost of poor quality (COPQ)**: rework hours, refunds, incident fines, SLA penalties, and opportunity cost from delays.  \n\nNow layer on three cross-metrics that keep models honest:\n\n* **Adoption rate:** percentage of eligible users who consistently use the AI tool. If adoption lags, value lags.  \n* **Utilization depth:** number of core features used per user-helps you spot “license but barely used” issues.  \n* **Reliability score:** success rate across key workflows (e.g., % of automated tasks completed without human intervention). A tool that saves 50% time in theory but fails 20% of the time in practice has shaky ROI.  \n\nFinally, maintain a single **North Star KPI** per use case: cost per ticket for support, qualified pipeline per rep for sales, publish-ready assets per editor for content, or queries answered under a latency SLA for data teams. Your ROI narrative should echo that KPI.\n\n**How to align AI investment with business outcomes and KPIs**\n\nTie each AI initiative to an existing goal that already matters to the business. Think in terms of **OKRs and operational KPIs**:\n\n* **Support:** reduce cost per resolution by 20% while improving CSAT by 0.3 points.  \n* **Sales/Marketing:** lift SQL-to-opportunity conversion by 10% while keeping unsubscribe rate under 0.2%.  \n* **Data/Engineering:** cut ETL lead time by 40% while holding data quality threshold at 99.5% valid rows.  \n* **Finance/Operations:** speed monthly close by 2 days without increasing post-close adjustments.  \n\nMap features to outcomes: if the AI tool claims “context-aware drafting,” define where that reduces time-to-first-draft; if it offers “automatic classification,” define which downstream reports become accurate and faster to produce. Put these into a **benefit hypothesis**:\n\n* **If** we roll out AI drafting for support macros,  \n* **then** first-response time will drop by 30% and reopen rates will not increase,  \n* **resulting in** 18% lower cost per resolution and a 0.2–0.4 CSAT lift.  \n\nYou’ll later test this hypothesis with A/B or sequential rollouts.\n\n**Key data points to collect before performing an ROI analysis**\n\nCollect the raw ingredients now, or your ROI math will wobble later:\n\n* **Workload baselines:** ticket volumes, content pieces per week, leads processed, code reviews completed, research tasks finished.  \n* **Time-on-task:** stopwatch studies, workflow logs, or system timestamps (start, submit, close).  \n* **Quality markers:** CSAT, NPS verbatims tagged by theme, QA pass rates, defect leakage, bounce/unsubscribe rates, “human edits per output,” and hallucination flags where relevant.  \n* **Cost inputs:** list prices, negotiated discounts, usage tiers, overage rates, training costs, implementation hours, and any extra infra.  \n* **Adoption telemetry:** daily active users, task coverage (% of tasks routed through AI), and opt-out reasons.  \n\nKeep your dataset tidy: consistent time windows, apples-to-apples units, and clear exclusion rules (e.g., exclude special campaigns or outage days). Create a short data dictionary so your future-self knows what each metric exactly means.\n\n**Author Insight:**[ **Akash Mane**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Surround_5480/) **is an author and AI reviewer with over 3+ years of experience analyzing and testing emerging AI tools in real-world workflows. He focuses on evidence-based reviews, clear benchmarks, and practical use cases that help creators and startups make smarter software choices. Beyond writing, he actively shares insights and engages in discussions on**[ **Reddit**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Surround_5480/)**, where his contributions highlight transparency and community-driven learning in the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem.**\n\n**Personal experience:** I ran an internal study for a content team that believed an AI summarizer would cut editing time in half. The baseline showed editors spending 16–22 minutes per summary, but quality rework erased most of the gains. We reframed the goal to reduce **time to usable outline** instead of final copy and narrowed the model’s task. That produced a consistent 35–40% time saving without a spike in rewrites. The lesson: align the AI to the exact slice of work where variance is high and quality is easy to check.\n\n**Famous book insight:** *Measure What Matters* by John Doerr (Chapter “Focus and Commitment,” pp. 134–139) underscores that teams win when outcomes-not activities-drive measurement. Use that lens to pick one KPI that every stakeholder recognizes as success for your AI rollout.\n\n# Breaking Down AI Costs (Direct, Indirect, and Hidden)\n\n**What counts as total cost of ownership for AI software?**\n\nThink in layers. The total cost of ownership (TCO) for an AI tool in 2025 is more than license × seats. A reliable TCO stack includes:\n\n1. Licensing and usage  \n\n* Seat licenses or per-user fees.  \n* Usage-based billing: tokens, credits, minutes, API calls, images generated, vector lookups, or jobs executed.  \n* Premium features: advanced models, RAG connectors, enterprise SSO, audit logs, or custom SLAs.  \n\n1. Implementation and integration  \n\n* Solution design and discovery hours.  \n* Data preparation: cleaning, labeling, schema mapping, embeddings, and index builds.  \n* Connectors and middleware: CRM hooks, support desk apps, data warehouse links, orchestration tools.  \n* Security and compliance set-up: DLP policies, role-based access, PII redaction.  \n\n1. Enablement and change management  \n\n* Training sessions, playbooks, office hours, and role-based SOPs.  \n* Internal knowledge base updates, example libraries, and QA rubrics.  \n* Shadow IT reduction: moving experimental notebooks into governed workflows.  \n\n1. Infrastructure and observability  \n\n* Storage for logs, prompts, and responses.  \n* Monitoring and evaluation: latency, error rate, hallucination rate, and cost-per-output dashboards.  \n* Caching, rate-limit control, and failover strategies.  \n\n1. Ongoing operations  \n\n* Model version updates (and revalidation of prompts or workflows).  \n* Vendor management and procurement overhead.  \n* Periodic security reviews and access audits.  \n\nPut these in one worksheet. Assign owners, start dates, and expected hours. When finance asks “what did this really cost,” you can point to precise line items instead of guesswork.\n\n**How to account for training time, integration, and workflow changes**\n\nTraining and integration are where optimistic spreadsheets fall apart. Model them explicitly:\n\n* Training time  \n   * Time to create prompt libraries, golden examples, and guardrail tests.  \n   * Role-based ramp: expect new users to hit only 40–60% of steady-state productivity in week one, 70–85% in weeks two to three, then 100%+ as shortcuts and templates spread.  \n* Integration complexity  \n   * Simple: a browser extension or a Slack bot with minimal permissions.  \n   * Moderate: a help desk integration that drafts replies and posts summaries back to the ticket.  \n   * Complex: ingestion from multiple systems, RAG with governed corp data, approval workflows, and analytics.  \n* Workflow redesign  \n   * Map “who does what, when, and with which source of truth.”  \n   * Add a **human-in-the-loop** step where quality or compliance matters.  \n   * Remove redundant steps. If AI drafts first, don’t also require a manual outline unless the outline is your approval gate.  \n\nTranslate all of this to hours, multiply by fully loaded hourly rates (salary + benefits + overhead), and add a contingency (usually 10–15%) for rework during the first 60–90 days.\n\n**Estimating ongoing maintenance, usage fees, and scaling costs**\n\nYour pilot might look cheap. Month four is where reality shows up. Plan for:\n\n* Usage drift  \n   * As adoption rises, token/credit consumption climbs. Track **cost per successful outcome** (e.g., cost per resolved ticket), not just spend.  \n   * Implement guardrails: max tokens per request, sensible defaults for context length, caching for repeat prompts, and batch scheduling for off-peak processing.  \n* Version and vendor changes  \n   * New model versions can shift quality and cost. Keep a small **canary cohort** on the new version and compare against control.  \n   * Budget 2–4 hours per major update for revalidating prompts, unit tests, and regression checks.  \n* Scaling costs  \n   * More users mean more support and governance. Expect costs for prompt libraries, policy updates, and periodic training.  \n   * For self-hosted or hybrid setups, include GPU/CPU provisioning, autoscaling buffers, and storage growth for embeddings and logs.  \n* Observability and evaluation  \n   * Allocate a monthly QA cycle: sample outputs, score against rubrics, and recalibrate prompts or retrieval settings.  \n   * Keep a small reserve (5–10% of monthly budget) for experiments that could improve quality or reduce unit costs.  \n\n**Personal experience:** A team piloted an AI assistant for lead research that looked cheap in month one-about ₹42 per qualified profile. By month three, as adoption surged and prompts grew longer, the unit cost quietly doubled. We added context caching and a rule that long-form enrichment runs in batches overnight. Unit cost fell below the pilot number, and throughput rose because daytime resources stayed free for interactive tasks. The fix wasn’t a bigger budget; it was engineering the workload to match billing physics.\n\n**Famous book insight:** *The Phoenix Project* by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford (Part III, pp. 201–214) highlights how unplanned work and invisible queues balloon costs. Make maintenance visible in your plan-usage caps, QA cadences, and change windows-so your AI TCO doesn’t get eaten by hidden work-in-progress.\n\n# Measuring Productivity Gains and Time Savings\n\n**How to quantify hours saved through AI automation**\n\nStart with a task inventory. For each role, list the recurring workflows that AI can influence-drafting, classification, enrichment, summarization, QA, scheduling, research. For every workflow, capture three numbers for the **pre-AI baseline** and the **post-AI pilot**:\n\n* **AHT (Average Handling Time)** per unit  \n* **Throughput** (units per hour)  \n* **Rework rate** (percentage of outputs requiring edits or rework longer than a set threshold)  \n\nThen apply this simple model:\n\n* **Time saved per unit** = Baseline AHT − Post-AI AHT × (1 − Failure/Retry Rate)  \n* **Net hours saved per period** = Time saved per unit × Units completed per period × Adoption rate  \n* **Cost saved per period** = Net hours saved × Fully loaded hourly cost  \n\nTwo guardrails keep these numbers honest:\n\n1. **Small time studies beat big assumptions.** Shadow a handful of real tasks per role across several days rather than timing a synthetic demo.  \n2. **Measure steady state, not week one.** Most teams see a dip during onboarding. Capture a pilot window after playbooks, prompts, and shortcuts stabilize (often weeks two–four).  \n\nAn example for support macros:\n\n* Baseline AHT = 6.5 minutes per ticket for a specific category  \n* Post-AI AHT = 3.9 minutes, with 8% of tickets needing manual retry  \n* Adjusted AHT = 3.9 ÷ (1 − 0.08) ≈ 4.24 minutes  \n* Time saved = 6.5 − 4.24 = 2.26 minutes per ticket  \n* At 4,000 tickets/month and 75% adoption, net hours saved ≈ (2.26 × 4,000 × 0.75) ÷ 60 ≈ 113 hours  \n* At ₹1,200 fully loaded hourly cost, savings ≈ ₹135,600/month  \n\n**Calculating cost-per-task improvements with before-and-after data**\n\nPair time with cost so finance sees the full picture. Use:\n\n* **Cost per task (CPT)** = (Labor cost per period + AI usage cost attributable to the task + Overheads specific to the workflow) ÷ Tasks completed  \n* **Delta CPT** = Baseline CPT − Post-AI CPT (positive is good)  \n* **Payback on CPT** = (Delta CPT × Volume per period) ÷ (Incremental AI expenses + One-time rollout costs amortized over N months)  \n\nWhen AI introduces a usage fee, the win shows up only if **labor reduction + quality uplift** outpace that fee. Track **cost per successful outcome**, not just cost per attempt. If an automated draft still needs heavy edits, count the human minutes. If your RAG answer resolves the question 80% of the time without escalation, multiply usage cost by 0.8 to reflect true coverage and add human minutes for the remaining 20%.\n\nA content example:\n\n* Baseline CPT for a 600-word brief: ₹1,050 (editor time + tooling)  \n* Post-AI: AI usage adds ₹120/brief; editor time drops enough that CPT becomes ₹780  \n* Delta CPT = ₹270; at 300 briefs/month, gross savings = ₹81,000/month  \n* If rollout + training cost ₹2,40,000 and you amortize across 6 months, monthly amortization = ₹40,000  \n* Net monthly benefit ≈ ₹81,000 − ₹40,000 = ₹41,000 → payback in ≈ 6 months including ramp; faster if volume grows  \n\n**Using benchmark stats to validate productivity assumptions (EEAT reminder)**\n\nBenchmarks protect your model from wishful thinking. Use three layers:\n\n1. **Internal historicals**: last 6–12 weeks of your own data for the same workflow and seasonality.  \n2. **Peer-validated ranges**: ranges from public case studies, community threads, or conference decks that match your task complexity. Treat them as **sanity bounds**, not targets.  \n3. **Third-party evaluations**: structured evaluations (e.g., prompt test suites, human rater rubrics, task-specific leaderboards) to validate that a claimed model or pipeline improvement holds on your data.  \n\nEEAT practices to keep your assumptions trustworthy:\n\n* **Experience:** show real annotated examples before and after, with edit timestamps.  \n* **Expertise:** publish the evaluation rubric-what counts as “usable.”  \n* **Authoritativeness:** reference external ranges where appropriate, while stating exactly how your tasks differ.  \n* **Trust:** disclose failure modes and opt-out criteria. If the tool struggles on edge cases, quantify the carve-out rather than burying it.  \n\nA quick validation trick: run a **paired test**. Give the same batch of tasks to a control team (no AI) and a pilot team (with AI) during the same week, then compare AHT, rework, and quality scores. If the lift shows up across both weekdays and weekends, and holds for at least two cycles, you likely have a real productivity gain.\n\n**Personal experience:** A research team assumed an AI transcript cleaner would cut editing time by 60%. Our paired test showed only 22% reduction because domain jargon tripped the model. We added a pre-pass glossary and boosted retrieval for common acronyms. The second test cleared 41% time savings with zero drop in accuracy. The fix wasn’t “more AI”-it was **task-specific context** and guardrails.\n\n**Famous book insight:** *The Lean Startup* by Eric Ries (Chapter “Measure,” pp. 109–138) argues for actionable metrics over vanity metrics. Frame your productivity story around cost per successful task and rework rate rather than generic “AI usage” graphs.\n\n# Revenue Growth and Performance Improvements\n\n**How AI can increase conversion rates, sales, or output volume**\n\nRevenue impact shows up when AI helps more visitors, prospects, or users say “yes” faster and more often. Think of three practical levers:\n\n1. **Relevance and personalization**  AI can tailor product copy, recommendations, and outreach to a person’s context-industry, prior behavior, and intent signals. That moves key funnel metrics: landing-page conversion, demo bookings, add-to-cart rate, and average order value. For example, an on-site assistant that detects category intent (e.g., budget vs. premium) can switch the value prop and CTA in milliseconds, lifting micro-conversions that compound down-funnel.  \n2. **Friction removal at decision points**  Where do people stall? Complex forms, unclear pricing, confusion about fit. AI reduces the time to answer objections: instant comparisons, eligibility checks, or configuration guidance. Faster answers cut drop-offs and increase **qualified progression**\\-people move from browse → trial → paid with fewer touches.  \n3. **Throughput without quality loss**  Sales and success teams can handle more accounts when AI drafts first passes (emails, proposals, summaries) and automates routine follow-ups. Output scales while keeping compliance guardrails, which protects brand and reduces refund risk. The revenue math improves not only by more volume but by **higher quality first touches** that earn replies instead of unsubscribes.  \n\nTo quantify these levers, anchor on **rate × volume × value**:\n\n* **Rate:** conversion rate at each stage (visitor→lead, MQL→SQL, SQL→closed-won)  \n* **Volume:** qualified traffic, lead count, meeting slots, proposals sent  \n* **Value:** ARPU, order value, LTV, cross-sell/upsell attachment  \n\nYour AI initiative should name the exact stage and variable it aims to move, then show the **before-and-after** deltas with confidence intervals if possible.\n\n**Isolating AI impact from other variables in your revenue stream**\n\nRevenue rarely changes for one reason. To isolate AI’s contribution, use a design that filters out noise:\n\n* **A/B or multivariate experiments**  Split traffic or accounts between AI-assisted and control experiences. Keep creatives, pricing, and promotions constant; only the AI component differs. Use **pre-registered success metrics** (e.g., add-to-cart rate, demo-book rate) to avoid moving goalposts mid-test.  \n* **Cohort and sequence tests**  If you can’t A/B, run phase-in cohorts. Week 1: control only. Week 2: roll AI to 25% of similar accounts. Week 3: 50%. Compare cohorts across identical seasonality (weekday/weekend) and discount windows.  \n* **Instrumented attribution**  Tag AI touches in your CRM/analytics: “AI draft sent,” “AI suggestion accepted,” “AI recommendation clicked.” When deals close, you can run a **logistic regression** or simple matched-pair analysis to estimate the lift attributable to AI touches while controlling for deal size, segment, and rep tenure.  \n* **Negative checks**  Watch for soft-fail signals that can fake a short-term lift but hurt revenue later: unsubscribes, spam complaints, returns/refunds, churn within the first billing cycle. If these rise, your “lift” is a mirage.  \n\nA simple attribution yardstick for outreach:\n\n* Baseline reply rate = 3.2% with human-crafted emails  \n* AI-assisted first drafts (with human QA) = 4.0%  \n* After removing segments that received a price promo that week, adjusted AI reply rate = 3.7%  \n* **Lift attributable to AI** ≈ +0.5 percentage points (relative +15.6%)-use this adjusted number for revenue modeling, not the raw top-line 0.8pp  \n\n**Tracking performance metrics over time for accurate ROI attribution**\n\nShort tests are exciting; sustained curves pay the bills. Build a **revenue telemetry board** with:\n\n* **Weekly funnel snapshot:** visits → signups → trials → paid, with conversion by segment and channel  \n* **Lead health:** qualified rate, disqualification reasons, and time-to-first-response  \n* **Sales motion:** stage-to-stage conversion, cycle time, win rate, discounting rate  \n* **Customer outcomes:** onboarding completion, activation milestones, first-value time, expansion after N days  \n* **Quality and risk:** unsubscribe, complaint, refund, early churn (e.g., churn &lt;60 days)  \n\nTreat the AI feature as a product with its own **release notes** and **experiment ledger**. When a model or prompt changes, flag the date on your charts so later trends don’t get misattributed. Re-run attribution quarterly to confirm the lift persists as audiences, competitors, and seasons change.\n\nA compact revenue model you can run monthly:\n\n* **Incremental revenue** = (Converted units\\_post − Converted units\\_base) × Average value  \n* **AI-attributable portion** = Incremental revenue × Attributable lift share (from A/B or cohort analysis)  \n* **Net revenue impact** = AI-attributable portion − Incremental AI costs (licenses + usage + extra ops)  \n\n**Personal experience:** A B2C subscription app added an AI-guided checkout explainer that translated feature jargon into plain, region-aware examples. Raw conversion spiked 11% the first week, but refunds also ticked up. We tightened the explainer to set clearer expectations, added a 24-hour “getting started” nudge, and tuned the eligibility rules. Net of refunds, the sustained conversion lift settled at 6.4% with a 90-day LTV that actually increased. The early spike would have misled us without the **negative checks** and LTV follow-through.\n\n**Famous book insight:** *Lean Analytics* by Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz (Chapter “One Metric That Matters,” pp. 29–46) argues that focus beats dashboards. Pick the one revenue metric your AI changes most-checkout conversion, SQL→opportunity, or activation rate-and make everything else support that story. When the OMTM moves and stays moved, the revenue case becomes undeniable.\n\n# Calculating ROI With a Standardized Formula\n\n**Step-by-step ROI formula tailored for AI investments**\n\nYou only need one clear equation, plus a few guardrails to keep it honest.\n\nCore equation for any time window:\n\n* **ROI (%)** = \\[Benefits−CostsBenefits − CostsBenefits−Costs ÷ Costs\\] × 100  \n* **Benefits** = **Labor savings** \\+ **Revenue uplift** \\+ **Cost avoidance**  \n* **Costs** = **Licenses/usage** \\+ **Implementation &amp; training amortized** \\+ **Ops &amp; evaluation**  \n\nHow to compute each term with discipline:\n\n1. Labor savings  \n\n* **Net hours saved** = (Baseline AHT − Post-AI AHT × 1−Failure/RetryRate1 − Failure/Retry Rate1−Failure/RetryRate) × Units × Adoption  \n* **Labor savings** = Net hours saved × Fully loaded hourly cost  \n* Include supervisory time reductions if AI automates reviews or reporting.  \n\n1. Revenue uplift  \n\n* **Incremental conversions** = Post-AI conversions − Baseline conversions (normalize for traffic and promos)  \n* **Revenue uplift** = Incremental conversions × Average value × Attributable share (from A/B or cohort analysis)  \n\n1. Cost avoidance  \n\n* Quantify reduced rework, fewer refunds, lower SLA penalties, and incident hours avoided.  \n* Use historical averages and document the assumption window.  \n\n1. Costs  \n\n* **Licenses/usage**: seats, tokens, credits, API calls, model upgrades.  \n* **Implementation &amp; training amortized**: one-time rollout divided by a sensible horizon (commonly 6–12 months).  \n* **Ops &amp; evaluation**: monitoring, prompt/library updates, periodic QA, dev hours for connectors.  \n\nAdd two sanity checks:\n\n* Compute **Cost per successful outcome** before and after (e.g., cost per resolved ticket, cost per publish-ready asset).  \n* Track **Payback period** = One-time costs ÷ Monthly net benefit. If payback exceeds your internal hurdle (e.g., 9 months), re-scope.  \n\nA compact worksheet header you can reuse:\n\n* Period, Units completed, Adoption %, Baseline AHT, Post-AI AHT, Retry %, Fully loaded rate, AI usage spend, Seats spend, Amortized rollout, Ops &amp; eval, Incremental conversions, Average value, Attributable share.  \n\n**Example ROI scenarios: low, medium, and high-impact use cases**\n\nAssume a monthly window and a fully loaded hourly cost of ₹1,200.\n\nLow-impact: AI summarizer for internal notes\n\n* Volume: 1,200 notes  \n* Baseline AHT: 3.5 min; Post-AI AHT: 2.8 min; Retry 10%; Adoption 60%  \n* Net hours saved ≈ \\[(3.5 − 2.8 ÷ 0.9) × 1,200 × 0.6\\] ÷ 60  \n   * Adjusted AHT ≈ 3.11; Time saved ≈ 0.39 min; Net hours ≈ 4.68  \n* Labor savings ≈ ₹5,616  \n* Revenue uplift: ₹0 (internal)  \n* Cost avoidance: ₹0 (no fines/SLAs)  \n* Costs: Usage ₹7,500; Seats ₹12,000; Amortized rollout ₹6,500; Ops ₹2,000 → **₹28,000**  \n* **ROI** = \\[(₹5,616 − ₹28,000) ÷ ₹28,000\\] × 100 ≈ **−80%**  Interpretation: Nice demo, weak economics. Keep for niche teams or bundle into a broader rollout where shared seats reduce per-workflow cost.  \n\nMedium-impact: Support drafting on two high-volume categories\n\n* Volume: 8,000 tickets  \n* Baseline AHT: 6.8 min; Post-AI AHT: 4.1 min; Retry 7%; Adoption 70%  \n* Net hours saved ≈ \\[(6.8 − 4.1 ÷ 0.93) × 8,000 × 0.7\\] ÷ 60  \n   * Adjusted AHT ≈ 4.41; Time saved ≈ 2.39 min; Net hours ≈ 223  \n* Labor savings ≈ ₹2,67,600  \n* Revenue uplift: not counted; we’ll keep support lean  \n* Cost avoidance: SLA penalties historically ₹40,000/month; after AI, missed-SLA incidents drop by half → **₹20,000** saved  \n* Costs: Usage ₹95,000; Seats ₹45,000; Amortized rollout ₹30,000; Ops ₹12,000 → **₹1,82,000**  \n* **ROI** = \\[(₹2,67,600 + ₹20,000 − ₹1,82,000) ÷ ₹1,82,000\\] × 100 ≈ **57%**  \n* **Payback** on one-time costs (₹30,000 rollout): ₹30,000 ÷ \\[(₹2,67,600 + ₹20,000 − ₹1,52,000 monthly run)\\] ≈ 0.2 months  Result: Healthy, defensible ROI with operational benefits.  \n\nHigh-impact: Personalization engine on checkout\n\n* Baseline: 2.1% conversion; Post-AI: 2.4% after attribution clean-up  \n* Qualified sessions: 5,00,000; Average order value: ₹2,200; Attributable share (post-controls): 70%  \n* Incremental conversions = 0.3pp × 5,00,000 = 1,500 orders  \n* AI-attributable orders = 1,500 × 0.7 = 1,050  \n* **Revenue uplift** = 1,050 × ₹2,200 = **₹23,10,000**  \n* Costs: Usage ₹4,20,000; Seats ₹1,10,000; Amortized rollout ₹1,50,000; Ops ₹55,000 → **₹7,35,000**  \n* Labor savings: negligible; Cost avoidance: modest ₹30,000 in fewer checkout chats  \n* **ROI** = \\[(₹23,10,000 + ₹30,000 − ₹7,35,000) ÷ ₹7,35,000\\] × 100 ≈ **217%**  \n* **Payback** well under one month  Result: Top-tier economics when you can reliably attribute conversion lift.  \n\n**When ROI is negative-and the right corrective steps**\n\nNegative ROI doesn’t always mean abandon. Use this triage:\n\n1. **Scope to the spike**  Find the subtask with the highest variance and measurable quality-e.g., first-draft outline, retrieval for FAQs, or entity tagging-then restrict AI to that slice. Narrow scope often flips economics.  \n2. **Tune prompts, retrieval, and guardrails**  \n\n* Add domain glossaries, canonical examples, and “don’t answer when uncertain” rules.  \n* Cache recurring context; cap tokens; shift long jobs to off-peak.  \n* Implement **human-in-the-loop** where disagreement risk is high.  \n\n1. **Right-size the plan**  \n\n* Move from per-seat to pooled or usage-tiered plans.  \n* Consolidate overlapping tools; one enterprise platform may reduce duplicative seats.  \n\n1. **Re-baseline and re-test**  Run a fresh paired test after changes. If ROI remains negative and strategic value is low, exit cleanly and reinvest where the math works.  \n\nA quick decision rubric:\n\n* **Strategic necessity high + ROI negative** → tune and narrow scope, re-evaluate in 30–45 days.  \n* **Strategic necessity low + ROI negative** → sunset, document learnings, and reallocate budget.  \n\n**Personal experience:** A growth team piloted AI-generated product comparisons that looked slick but increased refunds-the copy oversold edge cases. We pulled the feature behind a rule: AI drafts only for SKUs with clear, objective deltas, and human reviewers greenlight the final. Refunds normalized, and the feature earned a positive ROI on a smaller subset where claims were verifiable. The save came from **precision and governance**, not bigger models.\n\n**Famous book insight:** *Good Strategy/Bad Strategy* by Richard Rumelt (Chapter “The Kernel of Good Strategy,” pp. 77–95) emphasizes focus and coherent action. When ROI is negative, concentrate resources on the highest-leverage problem you can actually solve, then align policies and actions to support that focus.\n\nAs a practical note for readers who want periodic tool credibility checks and review signals, I share step-by-step audits on[ **LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akash-mane-0a7109229/) that map vendor claims to measurable outcomes and telemetry patterns.\n\n# FAQ\n\n# What’s the simplest way to estimate AI ROI before a full pilot?\n\nUse a three-number back-of-the-envelope model for a 30-day window. Estimate units per month, minutes saved per unit after a realistic failure/redo discount, and fully loaded hourly cost. Benefits ≈ Units × Minutes saved × Adoption ÷ 60 × Hourly cost. Subtract a conservative run cost (seats + usage) and a one-time rollout amortized over six to twelve months. If the result is clearly positive even with a 25–30% haircut, proceed to a timeboxed pilot with telemetry.\n\n# How long should the payback period be for AI tools in 2025?\n\nMatch your company’s hurdle rate. Many teams target a payback of three to nine months depending on cash flow and strategic value. If an initiative is mission-critical but the payback is longer, narrow scope to the highest-variance subtask so you bring payback inside the boundary while still learning.\n\n# What baseline data do I need before installing anything?\n\nCapture at least two to four weeks of pre-AI data for the exact workflow: volume, average handling time, rework rate, quality score, and any revenue-linked outcomes (conversion, average order value, qualified rate). Document edge cases you plan to exclude so the baseline and pilot match apples to apples.\n\n# How do I calculate fully loaded hourly cost for labor savings?\n\nUse salary plus benefits plus overhead (software, management, space, equipment) divided by annual productive hours. If you don’t have a precise overhead rate, use a reasonable company-standard markup to avoid understating savings. Keep the assumption documented in your worksheet.\n\n# What if usage-based fees spike as adoption grows?\n\nShift from “spend” to **cost per successful outcome**. Introduce token caps, caching, and batch processing for long prompts. Track adoption per feature to find high-cost, low-yield patterns and fix them first. Consider pooled licenses or plan tiers that better match your workload shape.\n\n# How do I keep A/B tests clean when marketing also runs promotions?\n\nLock creatives, prices, and discount windows during your test. If that’s impossible, tag every promotion and use stratified analysis that removes or normalizes promotional influence. Publish the attribution rule and stick to it so the results aren’t debated later.\n\n# How can small teams run ROI analysis without a data scientist?\n\nBuild a lightweight Google Sheet or notebook with these columns: period, units, adoption, baseline AHT, post-AI AHT, retry rate, hourly cost, seat cost, usage cost, amortized rollout, ops cost, conversions, average value, attributable share. Include built-in charts for trend lines. Keep the logic transparent and versioned.\n\n# What are the top pitfalls that make AI ROI look better than it is?\n\nCounting attempts instead of successful outcomes, ignoring rework minutes, mixing incomparable baselines, and attributing seasonal lifts to AI. Another common miss is quality drift: productivity improves for three weeks, then reviewers silently add back editing steps, eroding savings. Time-sample every few weeks to catch drift.\n\n# How do I value risk reduction like fewer errors or faster compliance?\n\nTranslate incidents avoided into hours, refunds, or penalties avoided using your last quarter’s averages. If historical incident counts are low, use a range with a midpoint and log the assumption clearly. Revisit the estimate once you have two to three months of post-AI incident data.\n\n# What’s a realistic adoption curve after launch?\n\nExpect a trough of disillusionment during weeks one to two as users learn prompts and shortcuts. Plan focused coaching and small wins. By weeks three to four, steady-state adoption often stabilizes if the tool is embedded in the primary workflow and not a side tab. Instrument “AI suggestion accepted” events so you can see true adoption, not just logins.\n\n# Should I choose open-source or commercial models for better ROI?\n\nDecide by total cost of quality, not ideology. Open-source can shine for privacy and customization when you have in-house talent, while commercial APIs can shorten time-to-value and ease maintenance. Compare cost per successful outcome and governance overhead for your exact workload and volume.\n\n# How often should I re-run the ROI model?\n\nMonthly for the first quarter, then quarterly. Flag model or prompt version changes on your charts. If usage or quality shifts after an update, isolate the date and run before/after slices so you don’t blame seasonality.\n\n# What if ROI is negative but the initiative is strategically important?\n\nConstrain scope to the slice where you can prove value quickly, add human-in-the-loop for high-risk steps, and revisit the model in 30–45 days. If the second pass is still negative and there’s no regulatory or customer requirement forcing it, exit gracefully and redeploy the budget.\n\n# How do I compare multiple AI vendors fairly?\n\nCreate a vendor-neutral evaluation pack: identical tasks, guardrail tests, latency ceilings, and token budgets. Score on accuracy, time saved, reliability, and cost per successful outcome. Add a maintenance score for ease of updates and a governance score for logging, redaction, and role-based access. Run the same pack quarterly to detect regression.\n\n# What metrics should go to leadership dashboards versus ops dashboards?\n\nLeadership: cost per successful outcome, monthly net benefit, payback remaining, adoption, and a single business KPI (e.g., cost per resolution, conversion, or activation). Ops: latency, failure rate, rework minutes, token consumption per task, cache hit rate, and feature-level adoption.\n\n# How do I prevent “seat sprawl” with overlapping AI tools?\n\nMaintain a quarterly catalog of tools, features used, seat counts, and workflow coverage. Consolidate where two tools solve the same job to reduce duplicative seats. Move niche features behind a shared platform or create a pooled license for part-time users.\n\n# Can I claim ROI from intangible brand or UX improvements?\n\nOnly if you can connect them to quantifiable outcomes like repeat visits, higher activation, or lower churn. Use proxy metrics with proven correlation in your product: faster time-to-answer correlating to higher activation, or fewer escalations correlating to lower churn. If the chain is weak, don’t book the benefit-log it as qualitative upside.\n\n# What’s a practical rubric to decide go, hold, or stop?\n\nGo if payback is under nine months and the one metric that matters moves with statistical confidence. Hold if the math is marginal but fixable via scope, prompts, or pricing. Stop if the strategic value is low and you’ve run at least one properly instrumented iteration without lift.\n\n**Personal experience:** A startup tried to justify a broad “AI everywhere” initiative but had thin telemetry. We pulled everything into a single cost-per-outcome view and found one workflow-entity labeling for analytics-carried 70% of the savings. We paused the rest, expanded labeling with tight QA, and hit payback in under two months. Momentum from a clear win made it easier to re-sequence the roadmap and bring other features online with better discipline.\n\n**Famous book insight:** The *Thinking, Fast and Slow* appendix and Part III on overconfidence (pp. 201–228) remind us that confident narratives love to outrun data. Build your AI ROI practice around measured experiments, guardrails, and explicit assumptions, so your forecasts bend toward reality rather than optimism.",

Teams are juggling UPI notifications, cloud invoices, and “pilot” subscriptions that never graduated. Meanwhile, leadership keeps asking the same thing in different ways-what’s the return? This guide gives you a practical, step-by-step framework to calculate the ROI of AI tools in 2025, with the exact metrics, formulas, and checkpoints that hold up under CFO scrutiny and Reddit-level debate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Understanding AI ROI in 2025&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What metrics matter most when evaluating ROI of AI tools?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start by splitting ROI into two clean lanes: value created and costs incurred. Value created usually shows up in three forms:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity gains (time saved)&lt;/strong&gt;  This is the easiest to model early. Track hours saved per role, per task, and multiply by fully loaded hourly cost. Tie it to &lt;strong&gt;before-and-after&lt;/strong&gt; baselines: average handling time (AHT) for support tickets, content turnarounds, code review minutes, lead research time, or data cleaning hours. Make sure the baseline is stable-use at least two weeks of pre-AI data for daily tasks, and four to six weeks for weekly or monthly tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue growth (conversion or output improvements)&lt;/strong&gt;  If an AI assistant improves copy quality, personalization, search relevance, or recommendation targeting, your value shows up as more demos booked, higher checkout conversion, better upsell acceptance, or higher LTV. You’ll measure &lt;strong&gt;conversion rate uplifts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;A/B test deltas&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;per-rep output&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., more qualified emails sent with fewer unsubscribes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk and quality improvements (error reduction, compliance, uptime)&lt;/strong&gt;  This is where many teams forget to assign value. Fewer data errors, lower PII exposure, faster incident response, better audit trails-all of these have a measurable cost-avoidance value. You can quantify this using &lt;strong&gt;cost of poor quality (COPQ)&lt;/strong&gt;: rework hours, refunds, incident fines, SLA penalties, and opportunity cost from delays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now layer on three cross-metrics that keep models honest:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adoption rate:&lt;/strong&gt; percentage of eligible users who consistently use the AI tool. If adoption lags, value lags.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utilization depth:&lt;/strong&gt; number of core features used per user-helps you spot “license but barely used” issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliability score:&lt;/strong&gt; success rate across key workflows (e.g., % of automated tasks completed without human intervention). A tool that saves 50% time in theory but fails 20% of the time in practice has shaky ROI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, maintain a single &lt;strong&gt;North Star KPI&lt;/strong&gt; per use case: cost per ticket for support, qualified pipeline per rep for sales, publish-ready assets per editor for content, or queries answered under a latency SLA for data teams. Your ROI narrative should echo that KPI.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to align AI investment with business outcomes and KPIs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tie each AI initiative to an existing goal that already matters to the business. Think in terms of &lt;strong&gt;OKRs and operational KPIs&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support:&lt;/strong&gt; reduce cost per resolution by 20% while improving CSAT by 0.3 points.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales/Marketing:&lt;/strong&gt; lift SQL-to-opportunity conversion by 10% while keeping unsubscribe rate under 0.2%.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data/Engineering:&lt;/strong&gt; cut ETL lead time by 40% while holding data quality threshold at 99.5% valid rows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finance/Operations:&lt;/strong&gt; speed monthly close by 2 days without increasing post-close adjustments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Map features to outcomes: if the AI tool claims “context-aware drafting,” define where that reduces time-to-first-draft; if it offers “automatic classification,” define which downstream reports become accurate and faster to produce. Put these into a &lt;strong&gt;benefit hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If&lt;/strong&gt; we roll out AI drafting for support macros,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;then&lt;/strong&gt; first-response time will drop by 30% and reopen rates will not increase,&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resulting in&lt;/strong&gt; 18% lower cost per resolution and a 0.2–0.4 CSAT lift.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You’ll later test this hypothesis with A/B or sequential rollouts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key data points to collect before performing an ROI analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Collect the raw ingredients now, or your ROI math will wobble later:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workload baselines:&lt;/strong&gt; ticket volumes, content pieces per week, leads processed, code reviews completed, research tasks finished.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-on-task:&lt;/strong&gt; stopwatch studies, workflow logs, or system timestamps (start, submit, close).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality markers:&lt;/strong&gt; CSAT, NPS verbatims tagged by theme, QA pass rates, defect leakage, bounce/unsubscribe rates, “human edits per output,” and hallucination flags where relevant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost inputs:&lt;/strong&gt; list prices, negotiated discounts, usage tiers, overage rates, training costs, implementation hours, and any extra infra.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adoption telemetry:&lt;/strong&gt; daily active users, task coverage (% of tasks routed through AI), and opt-out reasons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keep your dataset tidy: consistent time windows, apples-to-apples units, and clear exclusion rules (e.g., exclude special campaigns or outage days). Create a short data dictionary so your future-self knows what each metric exactly means.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Insight:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Surround_5480/\"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Akash Mane&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is an author and AI reviewer with over 3+ years of experience analyzing and testing emerging AI tools in real-world workflows.

Beyond writing, he actively shares insights and engages in discussions on&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Cute_Surround_5480/\"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Reddit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, where his contributions highlight transparency and community-driven learning in the rapidly evolving AI ecosystem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal experience:&lt;/strong&gt; I ran an internal study for a content team that believed an AI summarizer would cut editing time in half. The baseline showed editors spending 16–22 minutes per summary, but quality rework erased most of the gains. We reframed the goal to reduce &lt;strong&gt;time to usable outline&lt;/strong&gt; instead of final copy and narrowed the model’s task. That produced a consistent 35–40% time saving without a spike in rewrites. The lesson: align the AI to the exact slice of work where variance is high and quality is easy to check.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Famous book insight:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Measure What Matters&lt;/em&gt; by John Doerr (Chapter “Focus and Commitment,” pp. 134–139) underscores that teams win when outcomes-not activities-drive measurement. Use that lens to pick one KPI that every stakeholder recognizes as success for your AI rollout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Breaking Down AI Costs (Direct, Indirect, and Hidden)&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What counts as total cost of ownership for AI software?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think in layers. The total cost of ownership (TCO) for an AI tool in 2025 is more than license × seats. A reliable TCO stack includes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Licensing and usage&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Seat licenses or per-user fees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Usage-based billing: tokens, credits, minutes, API calls, images generated, vector lookups, or jobs executed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Premium features: advanced models, RAG connectors, enterprise SSO, audit logs, or custom SLAs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Implementation and integration&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Solution design and discovery hours.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Data preparation: cleaning, labeling, schema mapping, embeddings, and index builds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Connectors and middleware: CRM hooks, support desk apps, data warehouse links, orchestration tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Security and compliance set-up: DLP policies, role-based access, PII redaction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Enablement and change management&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Training sessions, playbooks, office hours, and role-based SOPs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Internal knowledge base updates, example libraries, and QA rubrics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shadow IT reduction: moving experimental notebooks into governed workflows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Infrastructure and observability&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Storage for logs, prompts, and responses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Monitoring and evaluation: latency, error rate, hallucination rate, and cost-per-output dashboards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Caching, rate-limit control, and failover strategies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Ongoing operations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Model version updates (and revalidation of prompts or workflows).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vendor management and procurement overhead.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Periodic security reviews and access audits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Put these in one worksheet. Assign owners, start dates, and expected hours. When finance asks “what did this really cost,” you can point to precise line items instead of guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to account for training time, integration, and workflow changes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Training and integration are where optimistic spreadsheets fall apart. Model them explicitly:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Training time&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Time to create prompt libraries, golden examples, and guardrail tests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Role-based ramp: expect new users to hit only 40–60% of steady-state productivity in week one, 70–85% in weeks two to three, then 100%+ as shortcuts and templates spread.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Integration complexity&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Simple: a browser extension or a Slack bot with minimal permissions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moderate: a help desk integration that drafts replies and posts summaries back to the ticket.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Complex: ingestion from multiple systems, RAG with governed corp data, approval workflows, and analytics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Workflow redesign&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Map “who does what, when, and with which source of truth.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add a &lt;strong&gt;human-in-the-loop&lt;/strong&gt; step where quality or compliance matters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Remove redundant steps. If AI drafts first, don’t also require a manual outline unless the outline is your approval gate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Translate all of this to hours, multiply by fully loaded hourly rates (salary + benefits + overhead), and add a contingency (usually 10–15%) for rework during the first 60–90 days.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Estimating ongoing maintenance, usage fees, and scaling costs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your pilot might look cheap. Month four is where reality shows up. Plan for:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Usage drift&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As adoption rises, token/credit consumption climbs. Track &lt;strong&gt;cost per successful outcome&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., cost per resolved ticket), not just spend.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Implement guardrails: max tokens per request, sensible defaults for context length, caching for repeat prompts, and batch scheduling for off-peak processing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Version and vendor changes&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;New model versions can shift quality and cost. Keep a small &lt;strong&gt;canary cohort&lt;/strong&gt; on the new version and compare against control.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Budget 2–4 hours per major update for revalidating prompts, unit tests, and regression checks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Scaling costs&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More users mean more support and governance. Expect costs for prompt libraries, policy updates, and periodic training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For self-hosted or hybrid setups, include GPU/CPU provisioning, autoscaling buffers, and storage growth for embeddings and logs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Observability and evaluation&lt;br/&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Allocate a monthly QA cycle: sample outputs, score against rubrics, and recalibrate prompts or retrieval settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keep a small reserve (5–10% of monthly budget) for experiments that could improve quality or reduce unit costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal experience:&lt;/strong&gt; A team piloted an AI assistant for lead research that looked cheap in month one-about ₹42 per qualified profile. By month three, as adoption surged and prompts grew longer, the unit cost quietly doubled. We added context caching and a rule that long-form enrichment runs in batches overnight. Unit cost fell below the pilot number, and throughput rose because daytime resources stayed free for interactive tasks. The fix wasn’t a bigger budget; it was engineering the workload to match billing physics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Famous book insight:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Phoenix Project&lt;/em&gt; by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford (Part III, pp. 201–214) highlights how unplanned work and invisible queues balloon costs. Make maintenance visible in your plan-usage caps, QA cadences, and change windows-so your AI TCO doesn’t get eaten by hidden work-in-progress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Measuring Productivity Gains and Time Savings&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to quantify hours saved through AI automation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start with a task inventory. For each role, list the recurring workflows that AI can influence-drafting, classification, enrichment, summarization, QA, scheduling, research. For every workflow, capture three numbers for the &lt;strong&gt;pre-AI baseline&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;post-AI pilot&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AHT (Average Handling Time)&lt;/strong&gt; per unit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Throughput&lt;/strong&gt; (units per hour)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rework rate&lt;/strong&gt; (percentage of outputs requiring edits or rework longer than a set threshold)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then apply this simple model:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time saved per unit&lt;/strong&gt; = Baseline AHT − Post-AI AHT × (1 − Failure/Retry Rate)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net hours saved per period&lt;/strong&gt; = Time saved per unit × Units completed per period × Adoption rate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost saved per period&lt;/strong&gt; = Net hours saved × Fully loaded hourly cost&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two guardrails keep these numbers honest:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small time studies beat big assumptions.&lt;/strong&gt; Shadow a handful of real tasks per role across several days rather than timing a synthetic demo.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure steady state, not week one.&lt;/strong&gt; Most teams see a dip during onboarding. Capture a pilot window after playbooks, prompts, and shortcuts stabilize (often weeks two–four).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An example for support macros:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Baseline AHT = 6.5 minutes per ticket for a specific category&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Post-AI AHT = 3.9 minutes, with 8% of tickets needing manual retry&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Adjusted AHT = 3.9 ÷ (1 − 0.08) ≈ 4.24 minutes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Time saved = 6.5 − 4.24 = 2.26 minutes per ticket&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At 4,000 tickets/month and 75% adoption, net hours saved ≈ (2.26 × 4,000 × 0.75) ÷ 60 ≈ 113 hours&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At ₹1,200 fully loaded hourly cost, savings ≈ ₹135,600/month&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calculating cost-per-task improvements with before-and-after data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pair time with cost so finance sees the full picture. Use:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost per task (CPT)&lt;/strong&gt; = (Labor cost per period + AI usage cost attributable to the task + Overheads specific to the workflow) ÷ Tasks completed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delta CPT&lt;/strong&gt; = Baseline CPT − Post-AI CPT (positive is good)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Payback on CPT&lt;/strong&gt; = (Delta CPT × Volume per period) ÷ (Incremental AI expenses + One-time rollout costs amortized over N months)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When AI introduces a usage fee, the win shows up only if &lt;strong&gt;labor reduction + quality uplift&lt;/strong&gt; outpace that fee. Track &lt;strong&gt;cost per successful outcome&lt;/strong&gt;, not just cost per attempt. If an automated draft still needs heavy edits, count the human minutes. If your RAG answer resolves the question 80% of the time without escalation, multiply usage cost by 0.8 to reflect true coverage and add human minutes for the remaining 20%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A content example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Baseline CPT for a 600-word brief: ₹1,050 (editor time + tooling)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Post-AI: AI usage adds ₹120/brief; editor time drops enough that CPT becomes ₹780&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Delta CPT = ₹270; at 300 briefs/month, gross savings = ₹81,000/month&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If rollout + training cost ₹2,40,000 and you amortize across 6 months, monthly amortization = ₹40,000&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Net monthly benefit ≈ ₹81,000 − ₹40,000 = ₹41,000 → payback in ≈ 6 months including ramp; faster if volume grows&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using benchmark stats to validate productivity assumptions (EEAT reminder)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Benchmarks protect your model from wishful thinking. Use three layers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal historicals&lt;/strong&gt;: last 6–12 weeks of your own data for the same workflow and seasonality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peer-validated ranges&lt;/strong&gt;: ranges from public case studies, community threads, or conference decks that match your task complexity. Treat them as &lt;strong&gt;sanity bounds&lt;/strong&gt;, not targets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-party evaluations&lt;/strong&gt;: structured evaluations (e.g., prompt test suites, human rater rubrics, task-specific leaderboards) to validate that a claimed model or pipeline improvement holds on your data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EEAT practices to keep your assumptions trustworthy:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; show real annotated examples before and after, with edit timestamps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expertise:&lt;/strong&gt; publish the evaluation rubric-what counts as “usable.”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Authoritativeness:&lt;/strong&gt; reference external ranges where appropriate, while stating exactly how your tasks differ.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust:&lt;/strong&gt; disclose failure modes and opt-out criteria. If the tool struggles on edge cases, quantify the carve-out rather than burying it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A quick validation trick: run a &lt;strong&gt;paired test&lt;/strong&gt;. Give the same batch of tasks to a control team (no AI) and a pilot team (with AI) during the same week, then compare AHT, rework, and quality scores. If the lift shows up across both weekdays and weekends, and holds for at least two cycles, you likely have a real productivity gain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal experience:&lt;/strong&gt; A research team assumed an AI transcript cleaner would cut editing time by 60%. Our paired test showed only 22% reduction because domain jargon tripped the model. We added a pre-pass glossary and boosted retrieval for common acronyms. The second test cleared 41% time savings with zero drop in accuracy. The fix wasn’t “more AI”-it was &lt;strong&gt;task-specific context&lt;/strong&gt; and guardrails.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Famous book insight:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Lean Startup&lt;/em&gt; by Eric Ries (Chapter “Measure,” pp. 109–138) argues for actionable metrics over vanity metrics. Frame your productivity story around cost per successful task and rework rate rather than generic “AI usage” graphs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Revenue Growth and Performance Improvements&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How AI can increase conversion rates, sales, or output volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Revenue impact shows up when AI helps more visitors, prospects, or users say “yes” faster and more often. Think of three practical levers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relevance and personalization&lt;/strong&gt;  AI can tailor product copy, recommendations, and outreach to a person’s context-industry, prior behavior, and intent signals. That moves key funnel metrics: landing-page conversion, demo bookings, add-to-cart rate, and average order value. For example, an on-site assistant that detects category intent (e.g., budget vs. premium) can switch the value prop and CTA in milliseconds, lifting micro-conversions that compound down-funnel.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friction removal at decision points&lt;/strong&gt;  Where do people stall? Complex forms, unclear pricing, confusion about fit. AI reduces the time to answer objections: instant comparisons, eligibility checks, or configuration guidance. Faster answers cut drop-offs and increase &lt;strong&gt;qualified progression&lt;/strong&gt;-people move from browse → trial → paid with fewer touches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Throughput without quality loss&lt;/strong&gt;  Sales and success teams can handle more accounts when AI drafts first passes (emails, proposals, summaries) and automates routine follow-ups. Output scales while keeping compliance guardrails, which protects brand and reduces refund risk. The revenue math improves not only by more volume but by &lt;strong&gt;higher quality first touches&lt;/strong&gt; that earn replies instead of unsubscribes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To quantify these levers, anchor on &lt;strong&gt;rate × volume × value&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rate:&lt;/strong&gt; conversion rate at each stage (visitor→lead, MQL→SQL, SQL→closed-won)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume:&lt;/strong&gt; qualified traffic, lead count, meeting slots, proposals sent&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value:&lt;/strong&gt; ARPU, order value, LTV, cross-sell/upsell attachment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your AI initiative should name the exact stage and variable it aims to move, then show the &lt;strong&gt;before-and-after&lt;/strong&gt; deltas with confidence intervals if possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Isolating AI impact from other variables in your revenue stream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Revenue rarely changes for one reason. To isolate AI’s contribution, use a design that filters out noise:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A/B or multivariate experiments&lt;/strong&gt;  Split traffic or accounts between AI-assisted and control experiences. Keep creatives, pricing, and promotions constant; only the AI component differs. Use &lt;strong&gt;pre-registered success metrics&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., add-to-cart rate, demo-book rate) to avoid moving goalposts mid-test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cohort and sequence tests&lt;/strong&gt;  If you can’t A/B, run phase-in cohorts. Week 1: control only. Week 2: roll AI to 25% of similar accounts. Week 3: 50%. Compare cohorts across identical seasonality (weekday/weekend) and discount windows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instrumented attribution&lt;/strong&gt;  Tag AI touches in your CRM/analytics: “AI draft sent,” “AI suggestion accepted,” “AI recommendation clicked.” When deals close, you can run a &lt;strong&gt;logistic regression&lt;/strong&gt; or simple matched-pair analysis to estimate the lift attributable to AI touches while controlling for deal size, segment, and rep tenure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative checks&lt;/strong&gt;  Watch for soft-fail signals that can fake a short-term lift but hurt revenue later: unsubscribes, spam complaints, returns/refunds, churn within the first billing cycle. If these rise, your “lift” is a mirage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A simple attribution yardstick for outreach:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Baseline reply rate = 3.2% with human-crafted emails&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;AI-assisted first drafts (with human QA) = 4.0%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After removing segments that received a price promo that week, adjusted AI reply rate = 3.7%&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lift attributable to AI&lt;/strong&gt; ≈ +0.5 percentage points (relative +15.6%)-use this adjusted number for revenue modeling, not the raw top-line 0.8pp&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracking performance metrics over time for accurate ROI attribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Short tests are exciting; sustained curves pay the bills. Build a &lt;strong&gt;revenue telemetry board&lt;/strong&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weekly funnel snapshot:&lt;/strong&gt; visits → signups → trials → paid, with conversion by segment and channel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lead health:&lt;/strong&gt; qualified rate, disqualification reasons, and time-to-first-response&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sales motion:&lt;/strong&gt; stage-to-stage conversion, cycle time, win rate, discounting rate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer outcomes:&lt;/strong&gt; onboarding completion, activation milestones, first-value time, expansion after N days&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quality and risk:&lt;/strong&gt; unsubscribe, complaint, refund, early churn (e.g., churn &amp;lt;60 days)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Treat the AI feature as a product with its own &lt;strong&gt;release notes&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;experiment ledger&lt;/strong&gt;. When a model or prompt changes, flag the date on your charts so later trends don’t get misattributed. Re-run attribution quarterly to confirm the lift persists as audiences, competitors, and seasons change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A compact revenue model you can run monthly:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incremental revenue&lt;/strong&gt; = (Converted units_post − Converted units_base) × Average value&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-attributable portion&lt;/strong&gt; = Incremental revenue × Attributable lift share (from A/B or cohort analysis)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net revenue impact&lt;/strong&gt; = AI-attributable portion − Incremental AI costs (licenses + usage + extra ops)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal experience:&lt;/strong&gt; A B2C subscription app added an AI-guided checkout explainer that translated feature jargon into plain, region-aware examples. Raw conversion spiked 11% the first week, but refunds also ticked up. We tightened the explainer to set clearer expectations, added a 24-hour “getting started” nudge, and tuned the eligibility rules. Net of refunds, the sustained conversion lift settled at 6.4% with a 90-day LTV that actually increased. The early spike would have misled us without the &lt;strong&gt;negative checks&lt;/strong&gt; and LTV follow-through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Famous book insight:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Lean Analytics&lt;/em&gt; by Alistair Croll and Benjamin Yoskovitz (Chapter “One Metric That Matters,” pp. 29–46) argues that focus beats dashboards. Pick the one revenue metric your AI changes most-checkout conversion, SQL→opportunity, or activation rate-and make everything else support that story. When the OMTM moves and stays moved, the revenue case becomes undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Calculating ROI With a Standardized Formula&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step-by-step ROI formula tailored for AI investments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You only need one clear equation, plus a few guardrails to keep it honest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Core equation for any time window:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROI (%)&lt;/strong&gt; = [Benefits−CostsBenefits − CostsBenefits−Costs ÷ Costs] × 100&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;Labor savings&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;Revenue uplift&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;Cost avoidance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Costs&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;Licenses/usage&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;Implementation &amp;amp; training amortized&lt;/strong&gt; + &lt;strong&gt;Ops &amp;amp; evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How to compute each term with discipline:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Labor savings&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Net hours saved&lt;/strong&gt; = (Baseline AHT − Post-AI AHT × 1−Failure/RetryRate1 − Failure/Retry Rate1−Failure/RetryRate) × Units × Adoption&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Labor savings&lt;/strong&gt; = Net hours saved × Fully loaded hourly cost&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Include supervisory time reductions if AI automates reviews or reporting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Revenue uplift&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incremental conversions&lt;/strong&gt; = Post-AI conversions − Baseline conversions (normalize for traffic and promos)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revenue uplift&lt;/strong&gt; = Incremental conversions × Average value × Attributable share (from A/B or cohort analysis)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cost avoidance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Quantify reduced rework, fewer refunds, lower SLA penalties, and incident hours avoided.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use historical averages and document the assumption window.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Costs&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Licenses/usage&lt;/strong&gt;: seats, tokens, credits, API calls, model upgrades.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation &amp;amp; training amortized&lt;/strong&gt;: one-time rollout divided by a sensible horizon (commonly 6–12 months).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ops &amp;amp; evaluation&lt;/strong&gt;: monitoring, prompt/library updates, periodic QA, dev hours for connectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Add two sanity checks:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Compute &lt;strong&gt;Cost per successful outcome&lt;/strong&gt; before and after (e.g., cost per resolved ticket, cost per publish-ready asset).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Track &lt;strong&gt;Payback period&lt;/strong&gt; = One-time costs ÷ Monthly net benefit.

Use this triage:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope to the spike&lt;/strong&gt;  Find the subtask with the highest variance and measurable quality-e.g., first-draft outline, retrieval for FAQs, or entity tagging-then restrict AI to that slice. Narrow scope often flips economics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tune prompts, retrieval, and guardrails&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Add domain glossaries, canonical examples, and “don’t answer when uncertain” rules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Cache recurring context; cap tokens; shift long jobs to off-peak.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Implement &lt;strong&gt;human-in-the-loop&lt;/strong&gt; where disagreement risk is high.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right-size the plan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Move from per-seat to pooled or usage-tiered plans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consolidate overlapping tools; one enterprise platform may reduce duplicative seats.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Re-baseline and re-test&lt;/strong&gt;  Run a fresh paired test after changes. If ROI remains negative and strategic value is low, exit cleanly and reinvest where the math works.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A quick decision rubric:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic necessity high + ROI negative&lt;/strong&gt; → tune and narrow scope, re-evaluate in 30–45 days.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic necessity low + ROI negative&lt;/strong&gt; → sunset, document learnings, and reallocate budget.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal experience:&lt;/strong&gt; A growth team piloted AI-generated product comparisons that looked slick but increased refunds-the copy oversold edge cases. We pulled the feature behind a rule: AI drafts only for SKUs with clear, objective deltas, and human reviewers greenlight the final. Refunds normalized, and the feature earned a positive ROI on a smaller subset where claims were verifiable. The save came from &lt;strong&gt;precision and governance&lt;/strong&gt;, not bigger models.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Famous book insight:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Good Strategy/Bad Strategy&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Rumelt (Chapter “The Kernel of Good Strategy,” pp. 77–95) emphasizes focus and coherent action. When ROI is negative, concentrate resources on the highest-leverage problem you can actually solve, then align policies and actions to support that focus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a practical note for readers who want periodic tool credibility checks and review signals, I share step-by-step audits on&lt;a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/akash-mane-0a7109229/\"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that map vendor claims to measurable outcomes and telemetry patterns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What’s the simplest way to estimate AI ROI before a full pilot?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use a three-number back-of-the-envelope model for a 30-day window. Estimate units per month, minutes saved per unit after a realistic failure/redo discount, and fully loaded hourly cost. Benefits ≈ Units × Minutes saved × Adoption ÷ 60 × Hourly cost. Subtract a conservative run cost (seats + usage) and a one-time rollout amortized over six to twelve months. If the result is clearly positive even with a 25–30% haircut, proceed to a timeboxed pilot with telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How long should the payback period be for AI tools in 2025?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Match your company’s hurdle rate. Many teams target a payback of three to nine months depending on cash flow and strategic value. If an initiative is mission-critical but the payback is longer, narrow scope to the highest-variance subtask so you bring payback inside the boundary while still learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What baseline data do I need before installing anything?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Capture at least two to four weeks of pre-AI data for the exact workflow: volume, average handling time, rework rate, quality score, and any revenue-linked outcomes (conversion, average order value, qualified rate). Document edge cases you plan to exclude so the baseline and pilot match apples to apples.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How do I calculate fully loaded hourly cost for labor savings?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use salary plus benefits plus overhead (software, management, space, equipment) divided by annual productive hours. If you don’t have a precise overhead rate, use a reasonable company-standard markup to avoid understating savings. Keep the assumption documented in your worksheet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What if usage-based fees spike as adoption grows?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shift from “spend” to &lt;strong&gt;cost per successful outcome&lt;/strong&gt;. Introduce token caps, caching, and batch processing for long prompts. Track adoption per feature to find high-cost, low-yield patterns and fix them first. Consider pooled licenses or plan tiers that better match your workload shape.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How do I keep A/B tests clean when marketing also runs promotions?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lock creatives, prices, and discount windows during your test. If that’s impossible, tag every promotion and use stratified analysis that removes or normalizes promotional influence. Publish the attribution rule and stick to it so the results aren’t debated later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How can small teams run ROI analysis without a data scientist?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Build a lightweight Google Sheet or notebook with these columns: period, units, adoption, baseline AHT, post-AI AHT, retry rate, hourly cost, seat cost, usage cost, amortized rollout, ops cost, conversions, average value, attributable share. Include built-in charts for trend lines. Keep the logic transparent and versioned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What are the top pitfalls that make AI ROI look better than it is?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Counting attempts instead of successful outcomes, ignoring rework minutes, mixing incomparable baselines, and attributing seasonal lifts to AI. Another common miss is quality drift: productivity improves for three weeks, then reviewers silently add back editing steps, eroding savings. Time-sample every few weeks to catch drift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How do I value risk reduction like fewer errors or faster compliance?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Translate incidents avoided into hours, refunds, or penalties avoided using your last quarter’s averages. If historical incident counts are low, use a range with a midpoint and log the assumption clearly. Revisit the estimate once you have two to three months of post-AI incident data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What’s a realistic adoption curve after launch?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Expect a trough of disillusionment during weeks one to two as users learn prompts and shortcuts. Plan focused coaching and small wins. By weeks three to four, steady-state adoption often stabilizes if the tool is embedded in the primary workflow and not a side tab. Instrument “AI suggestion accepted” events so you can see true adoption, not just logins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Should I choose open-source or commercial models for better ROI?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decide by total cost of quality, not ideology. Open-source can shine for privacy and customization when you have in-house talent, while commercial APIs can shorten time-to-value and ease maintenance. Compare cost per successful outcome and governance overhead for your exact workload and volume.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How often should I re-run the ROI model?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Monthly for the first quarter, then quarterly. Flag model or prompt version changes on your charts. If usage or quality shifts after an update, isolate the date and run before/after slices so you don’t blame seasonality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What if ROI is negative but the initiative is strategically important?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Constrain scope to the slice where you can prove value quickly, add human-in-the-loop for high-risk steps, and revisit the model in 30–45 days. If the second pass is still negative and there’s no regulatory or customer requirement forcing it, exit gracefully and redeploy the budget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How do I compare multiple AI vendors fairly?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Create a vendor-neutral evaluation pack: identical tasks, guardrail tests, latency ceilings, and token budgets. Score on accuracy, time saved, reliability, and cost per successful outcome. Add a maintenance score for ease of updates and a governance score for logging, redaction, and role-based access. Run the same pack quarterly to detect regression.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What metrics should go to leadership dashboards versus ops dashboards?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leadership: cost per successful outcome, monthly net benefit, payback remaining, adoption, and a single business KPI (e.g., cost per resolution, conversion, or activation). Ops: latency, failure rate, rework minutes, token consumption per task, cache hit rate, and feature-level adoption.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How do I prevent “seat sprawl” with overlapping AI tools?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maintain a quarterly catalog of tools, features used, seat counts, and workflow coverage. Consolidate where two tools solve the same job to reduce duplicative seats. Move niche features behind a shared platform or create a pooled license for part-time users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Can I claim ROI from intangible brand or UX improvements?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only if you can connect them to quantifiable outcomes like repeat visits, higher activation, or lower churn. Use proxy metrics with proven correlation in your product: faster time-to-answer correlating to higher activation, or fewer escalations correlating to lower churn. If the chain is weak, don’t book the benefit-log it as qualitative upside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What’s a practical rubric to decide go, hold, or stop?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Go if payback is under nine months and the one metric that matters moves with statistical confidence. Hold if the math is marginal but fixable via scope, prompts, or pricing. Stop if the strategic value is low and you’ve run at least one properly instrumented iteration without lift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal experience:&lt;/strong&gt; A startup tried to justify a broad “AI everywhere” initiative but had thin telemetry. We pulled everything into a single cost-per-outcome view and found one workflow-entity labeling for analytics-carried 70% of the savings.

This comes on top of the $40 billion the company has already invested in the country.\n\nThe breakdown: AI tools for 15 million small businesses, AI-enhanced shopping for hundreds of millions of consumers, and AI education for 4 million students. Amazon's also planning to quadruple cumulative eCommerce exports to $80 billion by 2030.\n\nAmazon has already digitized 12 million small businesses, enabled $20 billion in cumulative eCommerce exports, and supported 2.8 million jobs. By 2030, they expect the job count to reach 3.8 million.\n\nContext: This announcement came one day after Microsoft pledged $17.5 billion for AI and cloud computing in India over four years. Tech giants are racing to dominate India's digital infrastructure buildout, and they're betting big that India becomes the next major growth market.\n\n**For 3PLs:** If you're not thinking about India expansion, your competitors are. With 70% of Asia-Pacific 3PLs already planning growth there, this Amazon investment signals even greater fulfillment and logistics demand in the region.\n\n# Trump administration pulls 9,500 truck drivers off the road\n\nTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Wednesday that 9,500 truck drivers have been removed from service for failing an English proficiency test as part of the administration's crackdown on illegal immigrants in trucking.\n\n\"We've now knocked 9,500 truck drivers out of service for failing to speak our national language—ENGLISH!\" Duffy posted on X. \"This administration will always put you and your family's safety first.\"\n\nThe backstory: The DOT has taken several steps this year to crack down on non-English-speaking drivers in the name of highway safety. They've revoked commercial driver's licenses for noncitizens (temporarily paused by a federal court last month), detained illegal immigrant drivers in Oklahoma and Texas, and paused worker visas for foreign-born truckers.\n\n**What this means for the industry:** With 9,500 drivers suddenly off the road, capacity has tightened. Expect upward pressure on rates and longer lead times as carriers scramble to fill gaps in an already tight labor market.\n\n# Sponsored: Thinking About Selling Your 3PL?\n\nThe market is moving. In the last six months alone, FulfillYN has successfully closed three 3PL sales—all between 3.5-5x EBITDA, with deals closing in 3-6 months.\n\nHere's what makes the difference:\n\n* We maintain a list of over 25 active, vetted buyers actively looking for 3PL acquisitions\n* We understand your business model (because we live in this space every day)\n* We know how to position your operation to maximize exit value\n* We handle the process so you can keep running your business\n\nWhether you're planning an exit in the next year or just exploring what your business might be worth, now is the time to have the conversation. The buyer pipeline is strong, and valuations remain healthy for well-run operations.\n\nReady to explore your options?

China's trade surplus for 2025 has already exceeded $1 trillion.\n\nSoftening domestic consumption and demand in China has contributed to a weakened yuan versus the dollar, making China's exports cheaper and reinforcing trade imbalances. The years-long property downturn has hit household wealth, crimping consumer spending and sapping demand for imports.\n\nChina is offsetting declining U.S. exports by selling more in Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Europe. But that's led to complaints from trading partners as China's imports haven't kept pace.\n\nThe IMF says China needs comprehensive policies to encourage domestic spending. Chinese Premier Li Qiang acknowledged Tuesday that higher tariffs have \"dealt a severe blow\" to the global economy.\n\n# TikTok Shop cranks commission fees from 5% to 9% in Europe\n\nTikTok Shop is hiking its sales commission from 5% to 9% in the five EU countries where it operates—Germany, Spain, France, Italy, and Ireland. The change takes effect January 8.\n\nTikTok told sellers this week that the fee increase matches the UK, where commissions also rose from 5% to 9% after an introductory period. Despite the fee hike, TikTok Shop has grown rapidly in the UK—sales around Black Friday were 50% higher than last year, driven in part by 85% more sellers.\n\nIn specific sub-categories, commission will be slightly lower at 7%. New sellers joining from January 8 will pay only 4% commission during their first two months.\n\nThe growth trajectory: While Shein and Temu are seeing growth in Europe level off, TikTok Shop continues expanding strongly. According to ECDB, the platform will surpass Shein, Temu, AliExpress, and eBay in global GMV next year.\n\n**For 3PLs:** TikTok Shop has been available in the UK for four years and launched in Spain and Ireland late last year. Early this spring, it launched in Germany, France, and Italy, where fulfillment services will also become available. If your clients sell on TikTok Shop, expect higher volume—and be ready to expand into additional European countries next year.\n\n# Quick Hits\n\n**DHL doubles down on Tesla Semis**: DHL plans to add more Tesla Semis to its operations in 2026 as part of long-term efforts to hit zero emissions by 2050. The company already has 150 EVs in North America and expects the Tesla addition will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 metric tons annually. EVs already account for over 41% of DHL's fleet, and the company plans to electrify two-thirds of its fleet by 2030.\n\n**Belgian logistics software company Qargo raises $33M in a Series B round**: The AI-driven transport management system has raised a total of $54M, led by Sofina. Qargo's platform automates repetitive tasks across planning, execution, invoicing, and reporting for carriers, freight forwarders, and 3PLs.\n\n**Mercado Libre brings humanoid robots to Texas warehouse**: Latin America's leading eCommerce platform announced a commercial agreement with Agility Robotics to integrate Digit humanoid robots into its San Antonio facility. Digit will initially focus on commerce fulfillment tasks, with plans to explore additional use cases.\n\n**Aurora's autonomous trucks will go driverless in Q2 2026**: Detmar Logistics will begin hauling frac sand in Texas and New Mexico early in 2026, using Aurora Innovation's autonomous semis, operating 20 hours a day on public and private roads in the Permian Basin. The trucks will initially operate with a human driver in the cab, but Aurora and Detmar plan to go fully driverless in Q2 2026. Aurora is also expanding its terminal-to-terminal routes, with a Phoenix extension that would create a 1,000-plus-mile route between Fort Worth and Phoenix—well beyond traditional driver hours-of-service limits.\n\n# About FulfillYN\n\nFulfillYN connects fast-growing brands with vetted top-tier 3PL providers worldwide (300+ warehouses).

          "selftext": "**Looking for a reliable, professional-grade inflatable paint booth that won't break the bank?** Sewinfla has built a reputation as the \"middle-ground champion\" in the inflatable booth market—offering significantly better quality than budget brands like VEVOR while remaining far more affordable than premium American-made alternatives.\n\nBut with 17+ different models ranging from compact 13-foot units to massive 39-foot commercial booths, choosing the right Sewinfla booth can feel overwhelming. This comprehensive guide cuts through the marketing noise to give you honest, practical advice based on real user experiences and extensive product analysis.\n\n**What You'll Discover:**\n\n* Complete breakdown of all Sewinfla models with real-world sizing guidance\n* Honest comparison with VEVOR, GorillasPro, and other top competitors\n* Deep dive into the \"Elephant Trunk\" air draft device and why it matters\n* Setup and maintenance guidance to maximize your booth's lifespan\n* Where to find the best deals and avoid common buying mistakes\n\n*Based on analysis of 200+ customer reviews, forum discussions, and manufacturer specifications.*\n\n# Why Choose Sewinfla? Brand Overview and Key Advantages\n\n# The \"Elephant Trunk\" Air Draft Device Advantage\n\nSewinfla's biggest differentiator isn't their fabric quality or pricing—it's their proprietary **\"Elephant Trunk\" air draft device** that solves the #1 problem with most inflatable paint booths: poor indoor ventilation.\n\n**Here's why this matters:** Most inflatable booths simply blow filtered air in and hope it escapes through gaps in the fabric. This creates two major problems:\n\n1. **Overspray builds up inside the booth**, reducing visibility and paint quality\n2. **Fumes accumulate indoors** when used in garages or shops\n\nThe Elephant Trunk system creates a **dedicated exhaust pathway** that connects to a separate exhaust fan, actively pulling overspray and fumes outside. Based on user reports, this can reduce indoor air contamination by 80-90% compared to basic inflatable booths.\n\n**Real User Experience:** *\"I used my old VEVOR booth for 6 months and my garage always reeked after painting. With the Sewinfla Elephant Trunk setup, my wife can't even tell I've been painting.\"* \\- Mike R., Arizona\n\n# EPA-Registered Filters and Environmental Compliance\n\nWhile many inflatable booth manufacturers make vague claims about their filters, Sewinfla uses **EPA-registered filter materials** (EPA Est No:100507-CHN-1) that actually meet environmental standards.\n\n**The Two-Layer System:**\n\n* **Layer 1:** EPA-registered fiberglass filter captures paint particles\n* **Layer 2:** Activated carbon filter removes odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)\n\n**Why This Matters:** Some states and municipalities are cracking down on DIY paint operations that don't meet air quality standards. Having EPA-registered components helps demonstrate compliance and may be required for commercial applications.\n\n# US-Based Customer Service and Warranty Support\n\nOne of the biggest complaints about Chinese inflatable booth manufacturers is customer service—specifically, the lack of it. Sewinfla addresses this with:\n\n* **US warehouses** in Georgia and California for faster shipping\n* **American customer service staff** (not overseas call centers)\n* **12-month warranty** with responsive support\n* **Replacement part availability** for filters, blowers, and booth sections\n\n**Customer Service Reality Check:** Based on Amazon reviews and forum discussions, Sewinfla's response time averages 24-48 hours for warranty issues, compared to 1-2 weeks for many competitors. However, some users still report delays during peak seasons.\n\n# Custom Sizing and Professional Applications\n\nUnlike mass-market competitors, Sewinfla offers **custom booth sizing** for specialized applications:\n\n* **Aircraft painting** (used by experimental aircraft builders)\n* **Marine applications** (boats and yacht components)\n* **Industrial equipment** (machinery and large parts)\n* **Commercial vehicle** modifications\n\n**Size Range:** Standard models from 13×8×8 feet up to 56×25×20 feet, with custom options up to 80+ feet in length.\n\n# Complete Sewinfla Model Comparison: Finding Your Perfect Size\n\n# Understanding Sewinfla's Sizing System\n\n**Critical Point:** Sewinfla lists **exterior dimensions**, but you lose approximately 2-3 feet in each direction due to the inflatable pillars and air chambers.\n\n**Example:** A 26×15×10 booth has an **approximate interior workspace** of 20×11×8 feet.\n\n# Small Models (13ft-20ft): Parts, Motorcycles, and Furniture\n\n**Best For:** Motorcycle parts, furniture, cabinets, automotive components\n\n# Sewinfla Professional 13×8.2×8.2ft\n\n* **Interior Space:** \\~10×5×6 feet\n* **Blower Power:** 370W + 550W\n* **Best Use:** Small parts, motorcycle fairings, cabinet doors\n* **Price Range:** $450-550\n* **User Verdict:** Perfect for hobbyists but cramped for anything larger than a motorcycle\n\n# Sewinfla Professional 20×10×9ft\n\n* **Interior Space:** \\~16×7×7 feet\n* **Blower Power:** 480W + 750W\n* **Best Use:** Full motorcycles, small furniture pieces, large auto parts\n* **Price Range:** $650-750\n* **User Verdict:** Sweet spot for serious hobbyists—big enough for complete motorcycles but still manageable to set up alone\n\n# Medium Models (23ft-28ft): Cars, SUVs, and Small Trucks\n\n**Best For:** Sedan painting, SUV work, small pickup trucks, large furniture projects\n\n# Sewinfla Professional 26×15×10ft ⭐ MOST POPULAR\n\n* **Interior Space:** \\~20×11×8 feet\n* **Blower Power:** 750W + 950W\n* **Best Use:** Most cars, SUVs, pickup trucks\n* **Price Range:** $1,200-1,500\n* **User Verdict:** The \"Goldilocks\" model—big enough for most automotive projects without being overwhelming\n\n**Real User Experience:** *\"Perfect size for my '67 Camaro restoration.

This comprehensive guide cuts through the marketing noise to give you honest, practical advice based on real user experiences and extensive product analysis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You&amp;#39;ll Discover:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Complete breakdown of all Sewinfla models with real-world sizing guidance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Honest comparison with VEVOR, GorillasPro, and other top competitors&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Deep dive into the &amp;quot;Elephant Trunk&amp;quot; air draft device and why it matters&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Setup and maintenance guidance to maximize your booth&amp;#39;s lifespan&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Where to find the best deals and avoid common buying mistakes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Based on analysis of 200+ customer reviews, forum discussions, and manufacturer specifications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Why Choose Sewinfla? Brand Overview and Key Advantages&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The &amp;quot;Elephant Trunk&amp;quot; Air Draft Device Advantage&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sewinfla&amp;#39;s biggest differentiator isn&amp;#39;t their fabric quality or pricing—it&amp;#39;s their proprietary &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Elephant Trunk&amp;quot; air draft device&lt;/strong&gt; that solves the #1 problem with most inflatable paint booths: poor indoor ventilation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here&amp;#39;s why this matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Most inflatable booths simply blow filtered air in and hope it escapes through gaps in the fabric. This creates two major problems:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overspray builds up inside the booth&lt;/strong&gt;, reducing visibility and paint quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fumes accumulate indoors&lt;/strong&gt; when used in garages or shops&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Elephant Trunk system creates a &lt;strong&gt;dedicated exhaust pathway&lt;/strong&gt; that connects to a separate exhaust fan, actively pulling overspray and fumes outside. Based on user reports, this can reduce indoor air contamination by 80-90% compared to basic inflatable booths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real User Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I used my old VEVOR booth for 6 months and my garage always reeked after painting. With the Sewinfla Elephant Trunk setup, my wife can&amp;#39;t even tell I&amp;#39;ve been painting.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; - Mike R., Arizona&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;EPA-Registered Filters and Environmental Compliance&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While many inflatable booth manufacturers make vague claims about their filters, Sewinfla uses &lt;strong&gt;EPA-registered filter materials&lt;/strong&gt; (EPA Est No:100507-CHN-1) that actually meet environmental standards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Two-Layer System:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer 1:&lt;/strong&gt; EPA-registered fiberglass filter captures paint particles&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Activated carbon filter removes odors and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Matters:&lt;/strong&gt; Some states and municipalities are cracking down on DIY paint operations that don&amp;#39;t meet air quality standards. Having EPA-registered components helps demonstrate compliance and may be required for commercial applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;US-Based Customer Service and Warranty Support&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest complaints about Chinese inflatable booth manufacturers is customer service—specifically, the lack of it. Sewinfla addresses this with:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;US warehouses&lt;/strong&gt; in Georgia and California for faster shipping&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American customer service staff&lt;/strong&gt; (not overseas call centers)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12-month warranty&lt;/strong&gt; with responsive support&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Replacement part availability&lt;/strong&gt; for filters, blowers, and booth sections&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customer Service Reality Check:&lt;/strong&gt; Based on Amazon reviews and forum discussions, Sewinfla&amp;#39;s response time averages 24-48 hours for warranty issues, compared to 1-2 weeks for many competitors. However, some users still report delays during peak seasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Custom Sizing and Professional Applications&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike mass-market competitors, Sewinfla offers &lt;strong&gt;custom booth sizing&lt;/strong&gt; for specialized applications:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aircraft painting&lt;/strong&gt; (used by experimental aircraft builders)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marine applications&lt;/strong&gt; (boats and yacht components)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industrial equipment&lt;/strong&gt; (machinery and large parts)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercial vehicle&lt;/strong&gt; modifications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size Range:&lt;/strong&gt; Standard models from 13×8×8 feet up to 56×25×20 feet, with custom options up to 80+ feet in length.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Complete Sewinfla Model Comparison: Finding Your Perfect Size&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Understanding Sewinfla&amp;#39;s Sizing System&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Point:&lt;/strong&gt; Sewinfla lists &lt;strong&gt;exterior dimensions&lt;/strong&gt;, but you lose approximately 2-3 feet in each direction due to the inflatable pillars and air chambers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt; A 26×15×10 booth has an &lt;strong&gt;approximate interior workspace&lt;/strong&gt; of 20×11×8 feet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Small Models (13ft-20ft): Parts, Motorcycles, and Furniture&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best For:&lt;/strong&gt; Motorcycle parts, furniture, cabinets, automotive components&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Sewinfla Professional 13×8.2×8.2ft&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interior Space:&lt;/strong&gt; ~10×5×6 feet&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blower Power:&lt;/strong&gt; 370W + 550W&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Small parts, motorcycle fairings, cabinet doors&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price Range:&lt;/strong&gt; $450-550&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Verdict:&lt;/strong&gt; Perfect for hobbyists but cramped for anything larger than a motorcycle&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Sewinfla Professional 20×10×9ft&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interior Space:&lt;/strong&gt; ~16×7×7 feet&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blower Power:&lt;/strong&gt; 480W + 750W&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Full motorcycles, small furniture pieces, large auto parts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price Range:&lt;/strong&gt; $650-750&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Verdict:&lt;/strong&gt; Sweet spot for serious hobbyists—big enough for complete motorcycles but still manageable to set up alone&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Medium Models (23ft-28ft): Cars, SUVs, and Small Trucks&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best For:&lt;/strong&gt; Sedan painting, SUV work, small pickup trucks, large furniture projects&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Sewinfla Professional 26×15×10ft ⭐ MOST POPULAR&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interior Space:&lt;/strong&gt; ~20×11×8 feet&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blower Power:&lt;/strong&gt; 750W + 950W&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best Use:&lt;/strong&gt; Most cars, SUVs, pickup trucks&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price Range:&lt;/strong&gt; $1,200-1,500&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Verdict:&lt;/strong&gt; The &amp;quot;Goldilocks&amp;quot; model—big enough for most automotive projects without being overwhelming&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real User Experience:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Perfect size for my &amp;#39;67 Camaro restoration.

&lt;em&gt;Setup:&lt;/em&gt; Sewinfla 28×15×11 with complete Elephant Trunk system &lt;em&gt;Usage:&lt;/em&gt; 15-20 cars per month, primarily collision repair&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;We tried a couple cheaper booths first and they were disasters. The Sewinfla has been running for 2 years now with minimal issues. The Elephant Trunk system is worth every penny—our shop air quality improved dramatically. We&amp;#39;re looking at buying a second one for our expansion.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Success Factors:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proper exhaust system installation from day one&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Regular filter maintenance schedule&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Adequate electrical supply (dedicated 30-amp circuit)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional setup and anchoring&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROI Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt; Paid for itself in 8 months through increased productivity and reduced rework from contamination issues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;DIY Enthusiast Reviews&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sarah K. - Furniture Restoration Business&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Setup:&lt;/em&gt; Sewinfla 20×10×9 for furniture and cabinet projects &lt;em&gt;Usage:&lt;/em&gt; 2-3 times per week, water-based finishes primarily&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve had mine for 3 years and it&amp;#39;s still going strong. Setup is about 20 minutes by myself, which is totally manageable. The air quality improvement was immediate—I can actually work in my garage now without gassing out the family.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lessons Learned:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Pre-filters extend EPA filter life significantly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;LED lighting makes huge difference in finish quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Proper storage prevents most durability issues&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jennifer &amp;amp; Tom - Classic Car Restoration&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Setup:&lt;/em&gt; Sewinfla 33×16.5×11.5 for &amp;#39;67 Mustang restoration &lt;em&gt;Usage:&lt;/em&gt; Major project every 6 months, occasional touch-ups&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Overkill for most projects, but perfect for doing complete cars. We can fit the Mustang with room to walk around and bring in a parts cart. The key is having enough electrical capacity—we had to run a 240V line.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investment:&lt;/strong&gt; $2,200 total including exhaust system and electrical work &lt;strong&gt;Value:&lt;/strong&gt; Comparable professional booth rental would cost $3,000+ per project&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Professional Application Examples&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experimental Aircraft Builder - Van&amp;#39;s RV-7&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Setup:&lt;/em&gt; Custom 30×20×12 for aircraft components &lt;em&gt;Application:&lt;/em&gt; Stewart System water-based aircraft finishes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Sewinfla worked with us on a custom size that fit our hangar. We&amp;#39;ve painted wings, fuselage, and control surfaces with excellent results. The key is the temperature control—we added a small heater for winter work.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marine Shop - Yacht Component Refinishing&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Setup:&lt;/em&gt; Sewinfla 26×15×10 for boat parts and small craft &lt;em&gt;Application:&lt;/em&gt; Marine-grade paints and varnishes&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Salt air is tough on equipment, but the Sewinfla has held up well. We rinse it with fresh water after each use and store it in a climate-controlled space. On year 4 now with only filter replacements.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Common Complaints and How to Avoid Them&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complaint #1: &amp;quot;Booth deflated and ruined my paint job&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Root Cause:&lt;/em&gt; Power failure or blower malfunction during use &lt;em&gt;Prevention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use UPS backup power for critical projects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Never enter booth without someone monitoring from outside&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Install low-pressure alarms for early warning&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complaint #2: &amp;quot;Customer service was terrible&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Root Cause:&lt;/em&gt; Contacting wrong department or during peak seasons &lt;em&gt;Prevention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use correct email address ([&lt;a href=\"mailto:sewinfla@ejaee.com\"&gt;sewinfla@ejaee.com&lt;/a&gt;](mailto:&lt;a href=\"mailto:sewinfla@ejaee.com\"&gt;sewinfla@ejaee.com&lt;/a&gt;))&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Allow 48-72 hours for response during busy periods&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Include order number and photos for faster resolution&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complaint #3: &amp;quot;Booth fabric deteriorated quickly&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Root Cause:&lt;/em&gt; Chemical exposure, UV damage, or improper storage &lt;em&gt;Prevention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Avoid solvent-based cleaners on booth fabric&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Store away from UV exposure and temperature extremes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Clean thoroughly before storage to prevent chemical degradation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complaint #4: &amp;quot;Setup is more complicated than advertised&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Root Cause:&lt;/em&gt; Inadequate space planning or electrical preparation &lt;em&gt;Prevention:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Measure space carefully including overhead clearance&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Plan electrical requirements before purchase&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Watch Sewinfla&amp;#39;s setup videos before first use&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Final Recommendation: Is Sewinfla Right for You?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Sewinfla Sweet Spot&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sewinfla works best for:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serious DIY enthusiasts&lt;/strong&gt; who paint regularly but don&amp;#39;t need commercial-grade equipment&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small professional shops&lt;/strong&gt; looking for portable solutions&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget-conscious buyers&lt;/strong&gt; who want features and quality without premium pricing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indoor users&lt;/strong&gt; who need effective exhaust systems (Elephant Trunk advantage)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider alternatives if:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occasional use only&lt;/strong&gt; (VEVOR may be sufficient and cheaper)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maximum durability needed&lt;/strong&gt; (GorillasPro or premium brands)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercial daily use&lt;/strong&gt; (invest in permanent booth installation)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extremely tight budget&lt;/strong&gt; (DIY plastic booth may suffice)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Size Selection Quick Guide&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Most People:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motorcycle/Parts:&lt;/strong&gt; 20×10×9ft model&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cars/SUVs:&lt;/strong&gt; 26×15×10ft model (most popular)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Trucks:&lt;/strong&gt; 33×16.5×11.5ft model&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercial Use:&lt;/strong&gt; 39×20×13ft or custom&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget vs Performance Trade-offs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget Choice:&lt;/strong&gt; Basic booth without Elephant Trunk&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; $600-1,000 depending on size&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best For:&lt;/strong&gt; Outdoor use, occasional projects&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limitations:&lt;/strong&gt; Limited indoor use, basic filtration&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended Choice:&lt;/strong&gt; Complete system with Elephant Trunk&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; $1,200-2,000 depending on size&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best For:&lt;/strong&gt; Regular use, indoor applications&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Professional results, better air quality&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premium Choice:&lt;/strong&gt; Large booth with custom features&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost:&lt;/strong&gt; $2,500-5,000+&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best For:&lt;/strong&gt; Professional applications, commercial use&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt; Maximum capability, custom sizing available&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Making Your Decision&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with these questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often will you use it?&lt;/strong&gt; (Weekly use justifies higher investment)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s your largest project?&lt;/strong&gt; (Size booth for biggest anticipated need)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indoor or outdoor use?&lt;/strong&gt; (Indoor requires exhaust system)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s your total budget?&lt;/strong&gt; (Include exhaust fan, lighting, electrical work)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red flags to avoid:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buying too small&lt;/strong&gt; to save money (you&amp;#39;ll regret it immediately)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skipping exhaust system&lt;/strong&gt; for indoor use (health and legal issues)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring electrical requirements&lt;/strong&gt; (can double your total project cost)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not planning for maintenance costs&lt;/strong&gt; (filters, repairs, eventual replacement)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sewinfla represents the best value proposition in the inflatable paint booth market for users who want professional features without professional prices. Their Elephant Trunk system alone saves hundreds compared to competitors, and their US-based customer service provides peace of mind that Chinese-direct alternatives can&amp;#39;t match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bottom Line:&lt;/strong&gt; If you&amp;#39;re serious about paint quality and plan to use the booth regularly, Sewinfla delivers exceptional value. Just make sure you size it right the first time and budget for the complete system including exhaust—your lungs and your paint jobs will thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking to purchase? Check current pricing and availability on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Amazon,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;eBay, or&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;directly from Sewinfla. Remember to factor in exhaust system costs for indoor use and consider financing options for larger purchases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

While Beijing allowed them to start flowing after the Trump administration agreed in June to a series of trade concessions, China has maintained a lock on critical minerals for defense purposes. China supplies around 90% of the world’s rare earths and dominates the production of many other critical minerals.\n\nAs a result, one drone-parts manufacturer that supplies the U.S. military was forced to delay orders by up to two months while it searched for a non-Chinese source of magnets, which are assembled from rare earths.\n\nCertain materials needed by the defense industry now go for five or more times what was typical before China’s recent mineral restrictions, according to industry traders. One company said it was recently offered samarium—an element needed to make magnets that can withstand the extreme temperatures of a jet-fighter engine—for 60 times the standard price. That is already driving the cost of defense systems higher, say suppliers and defense executives.\n\nThe squeeze on critical minerals highlights how dependent the U.S. military is on China for much of its supply chain—giving Beijing leverage at a time of rising tensions between the two powers and heated trade negotiations. Defense manufacturers supplying the U.S. military rely on minerals that are mainly produced in China for microelectronics, drone motors, night-vision goggles, missile-targeting systems and defense satellites.\n\n[\\(Pending finance\\) \\~ NioCorp will produce Nb, Ti &amp; TiCl-4, Sc, Tb, Dy, Ny\\/Pr &amp; more....](https://reddit.com/link/1mhax7o/video/2if6xsk0gzgf1/player)\n\nWhile companies have tried to find alternative sources of these minerals in recent years, some of the elements are so niche that they can’t be economically produced in the West, say industry executives.\n\nChina’s Foreign Ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn addition to the more recent export controls on rare earths, China has since December banned sales to the U.S. of germanium, gallium and antimony—which are used for things like hardening lead bullets and projectiles, and to allow soldiers to see at night\n\nSome companies now warn of looming production cuts if more minerals aren’t forthcoming.\n\nOn Wednesday, the chief executive of Leonardo DRS said the U.S.-based defense firm is down to its “safety stock” of germanium.\n\n“In order to sustain timely product deliveries, material flow must improve in the second half” of 2025, CEO Bill Lynn said on a conference call. The company is the U.S. subsidiary of Italian defense giant Leonardo.\n\nGermanium goes into the company’s infrared sensors, which are used in missiles and other equipment. Lynn said that the company is looking at diversifying its supply chain while also finding ways to replace it in its products.\n\nThe Pentagon is requiring defense contractors to stop buying rare-earth magnets that contain China-sourced minerals by 2027. As a result, some companies have sizable stockpiles of magnets. But suppliers and defense companies often hold less than a year’s worth—some just a few months—of many other critical mineral stockpiles.\n\nDrone manufacturers are among the most vulnerable, because many are small startups and have very limited revenue or supply-chain savvy, and never got around to acquiring large stockpiles of rare-earth magnets and metals, say some in the defense industry.\n\n[OEMS, SSBN\\(x\\), F-47, Golden Dome &amp; some \\\\\"Magic craft?\\\\\" &amp; more need Critical Minerals!](https://reddit.com/link/1mhax7o/video/f8a21gijgzgf1/player)\n\n“I can tell you…we talk about this daily and our companies talk about it daily,” said Dak Hardwick, vice president of international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association, a U.S. defense and commercial aerospace trade group.\n\nMore than 80,000 parts that are used in Defense Department weapons systems are made with critical minerals now subject to Chinese export controls, according to data from defense software firm Govini. Nearly all of the supply chains for key critical minerals used by the Pentagon rely on at least one Chinese supplier, Govini said, meaning restrictions from Beijing can cause widespread disruptions.\n\nSince stepping up export controls earlier this year, China has begun requiring companies to provide extensive documentation of how they will use the rare earths and magnets they import. Chinese regulators often demand sensitive information, such as product images and even photos of production lines, to ensure none of the materials go to military use, say Western buyers.\n\nOne Western company that supplies Chinese-made rare-earth magnets to both civilian and defense companies says its requests for imported magnets have recently been approved for many civilian purposes—but rejected or delayed for defense and aerospace.\n\nIn May, New Hampshire-based ePropelled, which makes propulsion motors for drones, received unsettling questions from its Chinese magnet supplier. The supplier sent Chinese government forms demanding drawings and pictures of ePropelled’s products and a list of buyers. It also asked for assurances that the rare-earth magnets China would supply ePropelled wouldn’t go toward military applications.\n\n“Of course we are not going to provide the Chinese government with that information,” said Chris Thompson, vice president of global sales for ePropelled. The company has about 100 customers, including large American defense contractors and drone manufacturers in Ukraine.\n\nSo its Chinese suppliers paused shipping, and ePropelled had to delay some customer orders by one or two months—double the amount of time it usually takes to deliver its motors. The company sought alternative suppliers in the U.S., Europe and Asia, including buying magnets from vendors in Japan and Taiwan, although they too rely on rare earths from China.\n\nThe company also struck deals with startup magnet producers Vulcan Elements in North Carolina and Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth. However, those startups won’t have supply ready for ePropelled until at least the end of this year and will need to build up alternative sources of Chinese-dominated minerals as they scale up production.\n\nMetal traders say that because China demands to know the end user of rare-earth magnets and metals, it isn’t approving licenses for traders to stockpile.\n\nThe Department of Defense has awarded grants to expand production of niche materials, including $14 million in funding last year to a Canadian company to produce germanium substrates used in solar cells for defense satellites. In July, the Pentagon took an even bigger step when it agreed to pay $400 million for a stake in MP Materials, the operator of the largest rare-earths mine in the Americas, which is rapidly scaling up its magnet manufacturing capacity.\n\n**The Pentagon didn’t respond to a request for comment.**\n\nOn an earnings call last month Lockheed Martin CEO James Taiclet called the MP Materials agreement groundbreaking and said it would help ensure the supply of magnets needed in its [F-35 jet fighters](https://www.wsj.com/business/f35-jet-fighter-tariffs-2b807ad3) and cruise missiles. But building up new supply will take time.\n\n# GIVEN on JULY 28th. 2025~Lockheed’s Secret Sauce: Drops a hint at a \"Classified Cash Cow?\"\n\n[Lockheed's Secret Sauce: The Classified Cash Cow? - LMT Stock](https://investingsnacks.com/lockheed-s-secret-sauce-the-classified-cash-cow-lmt-stock/)\n\n[A full-size replica of the F-35 Lightning II sits in prime position outside the Lockheed Martin chalet at the 2014 Singapore Airshow.

Major defense companies “are starting to get more and more panicked as they go, because they recognize that they’re just not going to get the magnets, no matter what happens, unless they get involved,” said Nicholas Myers, the CEO of Phoenix Tailings, a Massachusetts startup that produces rare-earth metals.\n\nBeijing is signaling that it takes its mineral export bans very seriously. Earlier this year, one U.S. defense supplier, the United States Antimony Corporation, tried to ship 55 metric tons of antimony mined in Australia to its smelter in Mexico. The load transited via the Chinese port city of Ningbo—until recently a routine practice.\n\nBut in April, while the shipment was being transloaded in Ningbo, China customs detained it for three months, prompting United States Antimony to ask the State Department and White House for help.\n\n**The Chinese released the shipment in July, on the condition that it be sent back to Australia and not to the U.S. When it arrived in Australia, United States Antimony learned that product seals had been broken. It is currently working out whether the antimony has been tampered with or contaminated.**\n\n“The shipping company, everyone who was involved, they’d never seen this happen before,” said company CEO Gary Evans.\n\nNeither the White House, the Defense Department nor the State Department provided comment.\n\n**by Jon Emont, Heather Somerville, Alistair MacDonald**\n\n[Some good morning reads with Coffee!](https://reddit.com/link/1mhax7o/video/unsk7ulfizgf1/player)\n\n# AUGUST 4th, 2025~China Squeezes Critical Mineral Supply to U.S. Defense Industry\n\n[China Squeezes Critical Mineral Supply to U.S. Defense Industry | OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Squeezes-Critical-Mineral-Supply-to-US-Defense-Industry.html)\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1rvg2clfazgf1.png?width=718&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9de194e94a5c2ca796130e8fb79bd5ec299710a8\n\n**China is restricting the supply of critical minerals to U.S. military manufacturers, the Wall Street Journal has** [**reported**](https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-western-defense-industry-critical-minerals-3971ec51)**, adding that this has forced companies to delay order deliveries as they sought alternative suppliers.**\n\nThe supply restrictions have meanwhile inflated the prices of the critical minerals, the report also said. According to defense industry traders, some of these now cost five times as much as they used to, and in at least one case, a critical mineral cost 60 times as much as it used to before Beijing started to restrict supply.\n\nChina completely dominates the global market for critical minerals, putting Western defense manufacturers and their governments in a rather awkward position of depending on China for key raw material supplies amid tense bilateral relations.\n\nChina dominates refining for 19 of the 20 critical minerals that the International Energy Agency recently analyzed, holding an average market share of around 70%. “Three-quarters of these minerals have shown greater price volatility than oil, and half have been more volatile than natural gas,” the IEA said in May, noting that major risk areas include high supply chain concentration, price volatility, and by-product dependency.\n\nWhat is happening right now with U.S. military manufacturers is real-time evidence of this price volatility. Some of these companies are starting to warn about the possibility of production restrictions unless supply improves. One of them, Leonardo DRS, recently warned it has tapped its “safety stock” of germanium. Unless supply of the critical mineral improved by the end of the year, the company would have to delay deliveries.\n\nThis suggests the U.S. might be forced to make some concessions to China—because some of these vital minerals for the defense industry cannot be produced economically in the West, the Wall Street Journal wrote. Even those that could be produced economically would take a while to build supply chains.\n\nBy Irina Slav for [Oilprice.com](http://Oilprice.com)\n\n[NioCorp is part of the SOLUTION! ](https://reddit.com/link/1mhax7o/video/m08oia2jazgf1/player)\n\n# AUGUST 4th, 2025~The stealth war: How China is quietly squeezing the lifeline of US military technology through 'magnets'\n\n[The stealth war: How China is quietly squeezing the lifeline of US military technology through 'magnets' - The Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/the-stealth-war-how-china-is-quietly-squeezing-the-lifeline-of-us-military-technology-through-magnets/articleshow/123084346.cms?from=mdr)\n\n[Representative AI Image](https://preview.redd.it/czcxxvax7zgf1.png?width=650&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e437e96132eec443e095d4f3fb0901cf71c4b2b)\n\nChina is tightening its grip on the minerals that power the Western world’s most advanced weapons, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. The controls aren’t loud or flashy, aren’t loud or flashy, but they’re being felt in boardrooms, warehouses, and weapons factories across the United States.\n\nThe Pentagon has already started to feel the strain. Missiles, fighter jets, radar systems, drones — all depend on a steady stream of materials like gallium, germanium, and rare earth magnets. And right now, that stream is being choked.\n\nIn one example, a US drone component maker had its shipments of key Chinese-made magnets held up for weeks. Chinese suppliers had suddenly begun demanding detailed information about where the parts were going and how they’d be used. Chris Thompson, Vice President of Global Sales at ePropelled, said the company refused.\n\n“Of course we are not going to provide the Chinese government with that information,” Chris Thompson told WSJ.\n\nAs a result, the magnets stopped arriving. Production delays followed. ET has not been able to independently verify these claims.\n\n# What these critical minerals are and why they matter\n\nThese minerals aren’t obscure. They're the building blocks of nearly every modern military system.  \nGallium is used in radar and satellite communications. Germanium is key for night vision and infrared imaging. Antimony is used in explosives and armour-piercing ammunition. Rare earth elements like neodymium and samarium are found in high-performance magnets, which power everything from missile guidance systems to drone propulsion and F-35 flight controls.\n\n**Some, like dysprosium and terbium, are essential for heat-resistant alloys in jet engines. Others, like gadolinium, are critical for sonar and underwater surveillance systems.**\n\nThese materials aren’t just important, they’re irreplaceable. Substitutes either don’t exist or don’t work nearly as well.\n\nAnd the problem isn’t just that China mines a lot of them. It’s that China processes and refines most of the global supply. Even when the raw materials come from somewhere else, they often pass through Chinese refineries before reaching the production floor.\n\n# America’s arsenal is built on fragile foundations\n\nThis isn’t just a one-off problem. The deeper you look, the more it becomes clear: America’s defense supply chain is built on materials it doesn’t control.\n\nGovini, a defence analytics firm, recently found that more than 80,000 parts used across Pentagon weapons systems rely on minerals now facing Chinese restrictions. In many cases, these supply chains include only one or two vendors, and nearly all of them are connected to China.\n\n“We talk about this daily and our companies talk about it daily,” said Dak Hardwick, Aerospace Industries Association, as reported by WSJ.\n\nLeonardo DRS, a US military tech supplier, warned it’s already down to its \"safety stock\" of germanium, a metal essential for missile infrared sensors.\n\n“In order to sustain timely product deliveries, material flow must improve in the second half,” said Lenardo DRS's CEO Bill Lynn during a conference call with WSJ.\n\nThat’s the reality. Without these minerals, weapons can’t be built. Full stop.\n\n# From rare earths to antimony: China’s weapon of choice\n\nThe control isn’t just about rare earths. It includes antimony, used in explosives. Gallium and germanium, critical for semiconductors and optics. Samarium, gadolinium, dysprosium, all found in advanced radar and targeting systems.\n\nWhen China blocked exports of germanium and gallium in late 2024, the market barely blinked at first. But by April 2025, it expanded the bans to cover seven more categories of rare earths. Prices spiked. Delivery times stretched out. In one case, a western buyer was quoted a rate 60 times above the usual market price.\n\nIn another, US Antimony Corporation had a shipment of 55 tonnes of Australian-mined antimony blocked at Ningbo port. It sat for three months before being sent back, with seals broken and no clear explanation.\n\n# The West is years behind, and China plans to exploit it\n\nThere’s only one operational rare earths mine in the United States: Mountain Pass in California. While it’s been scaling up output, refining remains a problem. Much of the ore it produces still ends up in China for processing.\n\nMP Materials, which runs the mine, received over $400 million in US government funding to close that loop. But the gap between extraction and end-use is still wide.\n\nUkraine has emerged as a possible new source of rare earths and titanium, with the US pushing to support its mining sector as part of postwar reconstruction. But experts are blunt about the timeline.\n\n“Developing mine sites and sufficient infrastructure in the war-torn nation will take time, potentially decades,” said Aidan Knight, an associate analyst from GlobalData, as per a report by US Critical Minerals website.\n\nIn the meantime, the Pentagon has invoked emergency powers under the Defence Production Act to fast-track domestic mining. DARPA is trying to predict global supply trends using modelling software. And companies like Charles River Analytics are being paid millions to map out alternative sourcing strategies.\n\nStill, none of this is fast. And none of it changes the fact that in 2024, China produced 750 out of 760 tonnes of primary gallium worldwide. The US produced zero.\n\n# Running out the clock\n\nTime is now the biggest factor. The Pentagon has ordered contractors to phase out all Chinese rare earth magnets by 2027. Most firms have a few months of stockpiles, at best. For smaller defence suppliers, that’s not a transition, it’s a cliff edge.\n\nThis isn't the first time China has flexed its minerals. Back in 2010, it cut off rare earth exports to Japan over a maritime dispute. The move worked. Japan backed down. The message stuck.\n\nThis time, the target is wider. And the stakes are higher.\n\n# No minerals, no missiles\n\nThe logic is simple. You can't build 21st-century weapons without 21st-century materials. If a missile guidance system needs gallium and there’s no gallium, that missile doesn’t get made. If a fighter jet needs neodymium magnets and none are arriving, the assembly line stops.\n\nAs per a report by US Critical Minerals website, Lewis Black, CEO of Almonty Industries, which mines tungsten, put it plainly, “We are trying to break that addiction \\[to Chinese supply\\] because… like all addictions, it is unhealthy. We cannot afford to go cold turkey because we are just not strong enough to do it.\"\n\nUntil the addiction is broken, through new mines, new partnerships, and new infrastructure, Washington’s military ambitions will remain dependent on decisions made in Beijing.\n\nNot just a trade problem. A strategic vulnerability.\n\n# AUGUST 3rd, 2025~SSN(X): The New Navy Attack Submarine That Could ‘Break’ Russia or China in a War\n\n[SSN(X): The New Navy Attack Submarine That Could ‘Break’ Russia or China in a War](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/ssn-x-the-new-navy-attack-submarine-that-could-break-russia-or-china-in-a-war/ar-AA1JOXgM?ocid=msedgntp&amp;pc=HCTS&amp;cvid=688f674cad75427faf2679246269a701&amp;ei=10)\n\n[SSN\\(X\\): \\~2040\\~The New Navy Attack Submarine That Could ‘Break’ Russia or China in a War© SSN 774 Virginia Class Submarine Artist Rendering from U.S. Navy.](https://preview.redd.it/5z2g0kybkzgf1.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=516b547110356b272aab02f0353b762266cdd1f6)\n\n**Key Points and Summary -** The U.S. Navy is transitioning from its current Virginia-class Block V attack submarine to the next-generation SSN(X).\n\n\\-While the Block V is an evolutionary, versatile multi-mission platform serving as a \"bridge to the future,\" the SSN(X) is a revolutionary new design focused on ensuring dominance in a future peer conflict.\n\n\\-The SSN(X) is expected to be larger, faster, and the \"quietest submarine ever built.\"\n\n\\-It will carry a more advanced payload, including hypersonic missiles, and act as an underwater \"mothership\" for unmanned systems, consolidating the roles of multiple submarine classes into one superior platform.\n\n# SSN(X) Submarine Could Change Naval History\n\nThe U.S. Navy is currently undergoing a significant transformation in its undersea warfare capabilities, transitioning from the highly capable Virginia-class Block V submarines to the next-generation SSN(X) program. While both are [nuclear-powered attack submarines](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/a-u-s-navy-seawolf-class-submarine-will-be-out-of-action-for-5-years/), they differ significantly in their design philosophies and characteristics. The Virginia Block V is the culmination of decades of experience, while the SSN(X) is intended to redefine and revolutionize submarine warfare.\n\n# Virginia-Class vs SSN(X)-Class: What’s the Difference?\n\nThe Virginia-class was developed in the post-Cold War era as a more cost-effective and versatile alternative to the Seawolf-class. [The Block V variant](https://submarinesuppliers.org/programs/ssn-ssgn/virginia-class/), the latest and most advanced, reflects a steady evolution of the class. It incorporates lessons learned from earlier blocks and adapts to emerging threats, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Its design emphasizes multi-mission flexibility, modularity, and affordability.\n\nStrategically, the Block V serves to replace the aging Los Angeles-class submarines and supplement the [Ohio-class](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/america-deploys-u-s-nuclear-submarines-after-very-dangerous-russian-threats/) guided missile submarines (SSGNs) with enhanced capabilities for cruise missiles. A key feature of the Block V is the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), which significantly increases its missile capacity and overall firepower.\n\n**In contrast, the SSN(X) is an entirely new platform designed to ensure the next generation of American undersea dominance. It aims to combine the best attributes of the Seawolf-class (noted for its speed and stealth), the Virginia-class (known for its versatility), and the** [**Columbia-class**](https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/the-navys-348000000000-columbia-class-submarine-nightmare/) **(recognized for its endurance and survivability).

While Beijing allowed them to start flowing after the Trump administration agreed in June to a series of trade concessions, China has maintained a lock on critical minerals for defense purposes. China supplies around 90% of the world’s rare earths and dominates the production of many other critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, one drone-parts manufacturer that supplies the U.S. military was forced to delay orders by up to two months while it searched for a non-Chinese source of magnets, which are assembled from rare earths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Certain materials needed by the defense industry now go for five or more times what was typical before China’s recent mineral restrictions, according to industry traders. One company said it was recently offered samarium—an element needed to make magnets that can withstand the extreme temperatures of a jet-fighter engine—for 60 times the standard price. That is already driving the cost of defense systems higher, say suppliers and defense executives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The squeeze on critical minerals highlights how dependent the U.S. military is on China for much of its supply chain—giving Beijing leverage at a time of rising tensions between the two powers and heated trade negotiations. Defense manufacturers supplying the U.S. military rely on minerals that are mainly produced in China for microelectronics, drone motors, night-vision goggles, missile-targeting systems and defense satellites.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1mhax7o/video/2if6xsk0gzgf1/player\"&gt;(Pending finance) ~ NioCorp will produce Nb, Ti &amp;amp; TiCl-4, Sc, Tb, Dy, Ny/Pr &amp;amp; more....&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While companies have tried to find alternative sources of these minerals in recent years, some of the elements are so niche that they can’t be economically produced in the West, say industry executives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;China’s Foreign Ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In addition to the more recent export controls on rare earths, China has since December banned sales to the U.S. of germanium, gallium and antimony—which are used for things like hardening lead bullets and projectiles, and to allow soldiers to see at night&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some companies now warn of looming production cuts if more minerals aren’t forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the chief executive of Leonardo DRS said the U.S.-based defense firm is down to its “safety stock” of germanium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“In order to sustain timely product deliveries, material flow must improve in the second half” of 2025, CEO Bill Lynn said on a conference call. The company is the U.S. subsidiary of Italian defense giant Leonardo.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Germanium goes into the company’s infrared sensors, which are used in missiles and other equipment. Lynn said that the company is looking at diversifying its supply chain while also finding ways to replace it in its products.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon is requiring defense contractors to stop buying rare-earth magnets that contain China-sourced minerals by 2027. As a result, some companies have sizable stockpiles of magnets. But suppliers and defense companies often hold less than a year’s worth—some just a few months—of many other critical mineral stockpiles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Drone manufacturers are among the most vulnerable, because many are small startups and have very limited revenue or supply-chain savvy, and never got around to acquiring large stockpiles of rare-earth magnets and metals, say some in the defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1mhax7o/video/f8a21gijgzgf1/player\"&gt;OEMS, SSBN(x), F-47, Golden Dome &amp;amp; some \\&amp;quot;Magic craft?\\&amp;quot; &amp;amp; more need Critical Minerals!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I can tell you…we talk about this daily and our companies talk about it daily,” said Dak Hardwick, vice president of international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association, a U.S. defense and commercial aerospace trade group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More than 80,000 parts that are used in Defense Department weapons systems are made with critical minerals now subject to Chinese export controls, according to data from defense software firm Govini. Nearly all of the supply chains for key critical minerals used by the Pentagon rely on at least one Chinese supplier, Govini said, meaning restrictions from Beijing can cause widespread disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since stepping up export controls earlier this year, China has begun requiring companies to provide extensive documentation of how they will use the rare earths and magnets they import. Chinese regulators often demand sensitive information, such as product images and even photos of production lines, to ensure none of the materials go to military use, say Western buyers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One Western company that supplies Chinese-made rare-earth magnets to both civilian and defense companies says its requests for imported magnets have recently been approved for many civilian purposes—but rejected or delayed for defense and aerospace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In May, New Hampshire-based ePropelled, which makes propulsion motors for drones, received unsettling questions from its Chinese magnet supplier. The supplier sent Chinese government forms demanding drawings and pictures of ePropelled’s products and a list of buyers. It also asked for assurances that the rare-earth magnets China would supply ePropelled wouldn’t go toward military applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Of course we are not going to provide the Chinese government with that information,” said Chris Thompson, vice president of global sales for ePropelled. The company has about 100 customers, including large American defense contractors and drone manufacturers in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So its Chinese suppliers paused shipping, and ePropelled had to delay some customer orders by one or two months—double the amount of time it usually takes to deliver its motors. The company sought alternative suppliers in the U.S., Europe and Asia, including buying magnets from vendors in Japan and Taiwan, although they too rely on rare earths from China.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The company also struck deals with startup magnet producers Vulcan Elements in North Carolina and Oklahoma-based USA Rare Earth. However, those startups won’t have supply ready for ePropelled until at least the end of this year and will need to build up alternative sources of Chinese-dominated minerals as they scale up production.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Metal traders say that because China demands to know the end user of rare-earth magnets and metals, it isn’t approving licenses for traders to stockpile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense has awarded grants to expand production of niche materials, including $14 million in funding last year to a Canadian company to produce germanium substrates used in solar cells for defense satellites. In July, the Pentagon took an even bigger step when it agreed to pay $400 million for a stake in MP Materials, the operator of the largest rare-earths mine in the Americas, which is rapidly scaling up its magnet manufacturing capacity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pentagon didn’t respond to a request for comment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On an earnings call last month Lockheed Martin CEO James Taiclet called the MP Materials agreement groundbreaking and said it would help ensure the supply of magnets needed in its &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/business/f35-jet-fighter-tariffs-2b807ad3\"&gt;F-35 jet fighters&lt;/a&gt; and cruise missiles. But building up new supply will take time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;GIVEN on JULY 28th. 2025~Lockheed’s Secret Sauce: Drops a hint at a &amp;quot;Classified Cash Cow?&amp;quot;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://investingsnacks.com/lockheed-s-secret-sauce-the-classified-cash-cow-lmt-stock/\"&gt;Lockheed&amp;#39;s Secret Sauce: The Classified Cash Cow? - LMT Stock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/oh64t35phzgf1.png?width=900&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=41dd28981e4da8331bcf212f91bd7a286d5fce0c\"&gt;A full-size replica of the F-35 Lightning II sits in prime position outside the Lockheed Martin chalet at the 2014 Singapore Airshow.

Major defense companies “are starting to get more and more panicked as they go, because they recognize that they’re just not going to get the magnets, no matter what happens, unless they get involved,” said Nicholas Myers, the CEO of Phoenix Tailings, a Massachusetts startup that produces rare-earth metals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beijing is signaling that it takes its mineral export bans very seriously. Earlier this year, one U.S. defense supplier, the United States Antimony Corporation, tried to ship 55 metric tons of antimony mined in Australia to its smelter in Mexico. The load transited via the Chinese port city of Ningbo—until recently a routine practice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But in April, while the shipment was being transloaded in Ningbo, China customs detained it for three months, prompting United States Antimony to ask the State Department and White House for help.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Chinese released the shipment in July, on the condition that it be sent back to Australia and not to the U.S. When it arrived in Australia, United States Antimony learned that product seals had been broken. It is currently working out whether the antimony has been tampered with or contaminated.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The shipping company, everyone who was involved, they’d never seen this happen before,” said company CEO Gary Evans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Neither the White House, the Defense Department nor the State Department provided comment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;by Jon Emont, Heather Somerville, Alistair MacDonald&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1mhax7o/video/unsk7ulfizgf1/player\"&gt;Some good morning reads with Coffee!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;AUGUST 4th, 2025~China Squeezes Critical Mineral Supply to U.S. Defense Industry&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/China-Squeezes-Critical-Mineral-Supply-to-US-Defense-Industry.html\"&gt;China Squeezes Critical Mineral Supply to U.S. Defense Industry | OilPrice.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/1rvg2clfazgf1.png?width=718&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9de194e94a5c2ca796130e8fb79bd5ec299710a8\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/1rvg2clfazgf1.png?width=718&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9de194e94a5c2ca796130e8fb79bd5ec299710a8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China is restricting the supply of critical minerals to U.S. military manufacturers, the Wall Street Journal has&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-western-defense-industry-critical-minerals-3971ec51\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reported&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, adding that this has forced companies to delay order deliveries as they sought alternative suppliers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The supply restrictions have meanwhile inflated the prices of the critical minerals, the report also said. According to defense industry traders, some of these now cost five times as much as they used to, and in at least one case, a critical mineral cost 60 times as much as it used to before Beijing started to restrict supply.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;China completely dominates the global market for critical minerals, putting Western defense manufacturers and their governments in a rather awkward position of depending on China for key raw material supplies amid tense bilateral relations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;China dominates refining for 19 of the 20 critical minerals that the International Energy Agency recently analyzed, holding an average market share of around 70%. “Three-quarters of these minerals have shown greater price volatility than oil, and half have been more volatile than natural gas,” the IEA said in May, noting that major risk areas include high supply chain concentration, price volatility, and by-product dependency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What is happening right now with U.S. military manufacturers is real-time evidence of this price volatility. Some of these companies are starting to warn about the possibility of production restrictions unless supply improves. One of them, Leonardo DRS, recently warned it has tapped its “safety stock” of germanium. Unless supply of the critical mineral improved by the end of the year, the company would have to delay deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This suggests the U.S. might be forced to make some concessions to China—because some of these vital minerals for the defense industry cannot be produced economically in the West, the Wall Street Journal wrote. Even those that could be produced economically would take a while to build supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By Irina Slav for &lt;a href=\"http://Oilprice.com\"&gt;Oilprice.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1mhax7o/video/m08oia2jazgf1/player\"&gt;NioCorp is part of the SOLUTION! &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;AUGUST 4th, 2025~The stealth war: How China is quietly squeezing the lifeline of US military technology through &amp;#39;magnets&amp;#39;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/the-stealth-war-how-china-is-quietly-squeezing-the-lifeline-of-us-military-technology-through-magnets/articleshow/123084346.cms?from=mdr\"&gt;The stealth war: How China is quietly squeezing the lifeline of US military technology through &amp;#39;magnets&amp;#39; - The Economic Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/czcxxvax7zgf1.png?width=650&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=1e437e96132eec443e095d4f3fb0901cf71c4b2b\"&gt;Representative AI Image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;China is tightening its grip on the minerals that power the Western world’s most advanced weapons, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. The controls aren’t loud or flashy, aren’t loud or flashy, but they’re being felt in boardrooms, warehouses, and weapons factories across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon has already started to feel the strain. Missiles, fighter jets, radar systems, drones — all depend on a steady stream of materials like gallium, germanium, and rare earth magnets. And right now, that stream is being choked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In one example, a US drone component maker had its shipments of key Chinese-made magnets held up for weeks. Chinese suppliers had suddenly begun demanding detailed information about where the parts were going and how they’d be used. Chris Thompson, Vice President of Global Sales at ePropelled, said the company refused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Of course we are not going to provide the Chinese government with that information,” Chris Thompson told WSJ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, the magnets stopped arriving. Production delays followed. ET has not been able to independently verify these claims.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What these critical minerals are and why they matter&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These minerals aren’t obscure. They&amp;#39;re the building blocks of nearly every modern military system.&lt;br/&gt;\nGallium is used in radar and satellite communications. Germanium is key for night vision and infrared imaging. Antimony is used in explosives and armour-piercing ammunition. Rare earth elements like neodymium and samarium are found in high-performance magnets, which power everything from missile guidance systems to drone propulsion and F-35 flight controls.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some, like dysprosium and terbium, are essential for heat-resistant alloys in jet engines. Others, like gadolinium, are critical for sonar and underwater surveillance systems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These materials aren’t just important, they’re irreplaceable. Substitutes either don’t exist or don’t work nearly as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the problem isn’t just that China mines a lot of them. It’s that China processes and refines most of the global supply. Even when the raw materials come from somewhere else, they often pass through Chinese refineries before reaching the production floor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;America’s arsenal is built on fragile foundations&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just a one-off problem. The deeper you look, the more it becomes clear: America’s defense supply chain is built on materials it doesn’t control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Govini, a defence analytics firm, recently found that more than 80,000 parts used across Pentagon weapons systems rely on minerals now facing Chinese restrictions. In many cases, these supply chains include only one or two vendors, and nearly all of them are connected to China.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We talk about this daily and our companies talk about it daily,” said Dak Hardwick, Aerospace Industries Association, as reported by WSJ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leonardo DRS, a US military tech supplier, warned it’s already down to its &amp;quot;safety stock&amp;quot; of germanium, a metal essential for missile infrared sensors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“In order to sustain timely product deliveries, material flow must improve in the second half,” said Lenardo DRS&amp;#39;s CEO Bill Lynn during a conference call with WSJ.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That’s the reality. Without these minerals, weapons can’t be built. Full stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;From rare earths to antimony: China’s weapon of choice&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The control isn’t just about rare earths. It includes antimony, used in explosives. Gallium and germanium, critical for semiconductors and optics. Samarium, gadolinium, dysprosium, all found in advanced radar and targeting systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When China blocked exports of germanium and gallium in late 2024, the market barely blinked at first. But by April 2025, it expanded the bans to cover seven more categories of rare earths. Prices spiked. Delivery times stretched out. In one case, a western buyer was quoted a rate 60 times above the usual market price.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In another, US Antimony Corporation had a shipment of 55 tonnes of Australian-mined antimony blocked at Ningbo port. It sat for three months before being sent back, with seals broken and no clear explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The West is years behind, and China plans to exploit it&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There’s only one operational rare earths mine in the United States: Mountain Pass in California. While it’s been scaling up output, refining remains a problem. Much of the ore it produces still ends up in China for processing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;MP Materials, which runs the mine, received over $400 million in US government funding to close that loop. But the gap between extraction and end-use is still wide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has emerged as a possible new source of rare earths and titanium, with the US pushing to support its mining sector as part of postwar reconstruction. But experts are blunt about the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Developing mine sites and sufficient infrastructure in the war-torn nation will take time, potentially decades,” said Aidan Knight, an associate analyst from GlobalData, as per a report by US Critical Minerals website.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the Pentagon has invoked emergency powers under the Defence Production Act to fast-track domestic mining. DARPA is trying to predict global supply trends using modelling software. And companies like Charles River Analytics are being paid millions to map out alternative sourcing strategies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, none of this is fast. And none of it changes the fact that in 2024, China produced 750 out of 760 tonnes of primary gallium worldwide. The US produced zero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Running out the clock&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Time is now the biggest factor. The Pentagon has ordered contractors to phase out all Chinese rare earth magnets by 2027. Most firms have a few months of stockpiles, at best. For smaller defence suppliers, that’s not a transition, it’s a cliff edge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t the first time China has flexed its minerals. Back in 2010, it cut off rare earth exports to Japan over a maritime dispute. The move worked. Japan backed down. The message stuck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time, the target is wider. And the stakes are higher.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;No minerals, no missiles&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The logic is simple. You can&amp;#39;t build 21st-century weapons without 21st-century materials. If a missile guidance system needs gallium and there’s no gallium, that missile doesn’t get made. If a fighter jet needs neodymium magnets and none are arriving, the assembly line stops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As per a report by US Critical Minerals website, Lewis Black, CEO of Almonty Industries, which mines tungsten, put it plainly, “We are trying to break that addiction [to Chinese supply] because… like all addictions, it is unhealthy. We cannot afford to go cold turkey because we are just not strong enough to do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until the addiction is broken, through new mines, new partnerships, and new infrastructure, Washington’s military ambitions will remain dependent on decisions made in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not just a trade problem. A strategic vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;AUGUST 3rd, 2025~SSN(X): The New Navy Attack Submarine That Could ‘Break’ Russia or China in a War&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/ssn-x-the-new-navy-attack-submarine-that-could-break-russia-or-china-in-a-war/ar-AA1JOXgM?ocid=msedgntp&amp;amp;pc=HCTS&amp;amp;cvid=688f674cad75427faf2679246269a701&amp;amp;ei=10\"&gt;SSN(X): The New Navy Attack Submarine That Could ‘Break’ Russia or China in a War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5z2g0kybkzgf1.png?width=768&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=516b547110356b272aab02f0353b762266cdd1f6\"&gt;SSN(X): ~2040~The New Navy Attack Submarine That Could ‘Break’ Russia or China in a War© SSN 774 Virginia Class Submarine Artist Rendering from U.S. Navy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points and Summary -&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. Navy is transitioning from its current Virginia-class Block V attack submarine to the next-generation SSN(X).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-While the Block V is an evolutionary, versatile multi-mission platform serving as a &amp;quot;bridge to the future,&amp;quot; the SSN(X) is a revolutionary new design focused on ensuring dominance in a future peer conflict.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-The SSN(X) is expected to be larger, faster, and the &amp;quot;quietest submarine ever built.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-It will carry a more advanced payload, including hypersonic missiles, and act as an underwater &amp;quot;mothership&amp;quot; for unmanned systems, consolidating the roles of multiple submarine classes into one superior platform.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;SSN(X) Submarine Could Change Naval History&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Navy is currently undergoing a significant transformation in its undersea warfare capabilities, transitioning from the highly capable Virginia-class Block V submarines to the next-generation SSN(X) program. While both are &lt;a href=\"https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/a-u-s-navy-seawolf-class-submarine-will-be-out-of-action-for-5-years/\"&gt;nuclear-powered attack submarines&lt;/a&gt;, they differ significantly in their design philosophies and characteristics. The Virginia Block V is the culmination of decades of experience, while the SSN(X) is intended to redefine and revolutionize submarine warfare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Virginia-Class vs SSN(X)-Class: What’s the Difference?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Virginia-class was developed in the post-Cold War era as a more cost-effective and versatile alternative to the Seawolf-class. &lt;a href=\"https://submarinesuppliers.org/programs/ssn-ssgn/virginia-class/\"&gt;The Block V variant&lt;/a&gt;, the latest and most advanced, reflects a steady evolution of the class. It incorporates lessons learned from earlier blocks and adapts to emerging threats, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region. Its design emphasizes multi-mission flexibility, modularity, and affordability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Strategically, the Block V serves to replace the aging Los Angeles-class submarines and supplement the &lt;a href=\"https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/america-deploys-u-s-nuclear-submarines-after-very-dangerous-russian-threats/\"&gt;Ohio-class&lt;/a&gt; guided missile submarines (SSGNs) with enhanced capabilities for cruise missiles. A key feature of the Block V is the Virginia Payload Module (VPM), which significantly increases its missile capacity and overall firepower.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In contrast, the SSN(X) is an entirely new platform designed to ensure the next generation of American undersea dominance. It aims to combine the best attributes of the Seawolf-class (noted for its speed and stealth), the Virginia-class (known for its versatility), and the&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://nationalsecurityjournal.org/the-navys-348000000000-columbia-class-submarine-nightmare/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Columbia-class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;(recognized for its endurance and survivability).

          "selftext": "My name is John Mercer, and I suppose, if this ever becomes part of some official record, I want it known that I never set out to uncover anything extraordinary. I wasn’t the kind of person who believed in miracles or thought the stars were hiding messages just waiting for us to listen. I’m a data analyst. A glorified librarian of deep-space noise. My job — for nearly two decades — was to catalogue, clean, and occasionally reprocess ancient signals collected by satellites most people forgot existed.\n\nWe called it The Archive — a digital cemetery of telemetry logs, half-corrupted frequencies, solar interference recordings, and false positives from outdated SETI dishes. It sat in the lower levels of NASA’s data complex in Pasadena — not glamorous, not secret, just dusty and ignored. Most of my colleagues moved on to active missions or commercial space work. But a few of us — misfits, really — stayed behind, caught in the gravity of something bigger we couldn’t quite name.\n\nIn 2081, things changed.\n\nThat was the year we got access to Lucida, a neural-net AI built to sift through raw signal data using something beyond pattern recognition — it searched for structure. Lucida didn’t care about language or voice. It cared about logic. About how data might be arranged if it came from something — or someone — with intent.\n\nWe had barely integrated Lucida into the Archive workflow when she flagged something. It came from a 1974 transmission batch — part of a long-forgotten deep-space listening session from Goldstone, California. The log was marked as “thermal drift and echo” — basically, space static. It had sat unexamined for over a century.\n\nBut Lucida didn’t see noise. She saw a filesystem.\n\nAt first, we thought it was a glitch. Priya, my lead systems engineer, laughed and called it a “ghost in the tape.” But when we ran the data again, and then a third time, we couldn’t ignore the alignment. There were sector blocks, checksums, headers, and what looked like data clusters. It wasn’t a language. It was a container. Something had been encoded here — not to be heard, but to be read.\n\nAnd strangest of all? The format resembled FAT32.\n\nThat got everyone’s attention.\n\nTomas, our signal specialist, said it was impossible. That a 20th-century Microsoft storage architecture — or anything close to it — showing up in an alien signal would be like finding an abacus on Mars carved into the walls of a Martian temple. Too absurd to be coincidence.\n\nBut Lucida didn’t think so.\n\nWe worked late into the night, feeding her every known variant of file allocation logic, trying to interpret the block structures. And slowly, like bones rising from dirt, the system took shape. It wasn’t human. But it was close enough to echo our way of thinking. Which is what terrified me more than anything — not that someone sent us a message, but that whoever they were, they thought like us.\n\nWe pulled out sixteen files.\n\nNo audio. No text. Just sixteen compressed images stored in raw binary. It took us weeks to decompress them without destroying the formatting. Every success felt like chiseling through stone, one bit at a time.\n\nWhen we finally saw the first image, no one spoke.\n\nA black field filled the screen. Dotted with arcs, spirals, and points of light. A grid overlaid with an intricate coordinate system — not Earth-based, not even galactic center-based — but internally consistent. Every image showed a different region of space, captured from a fixed point of origin. As we layered them together, something became clear:\n\nIt was a map.\n\nA galactic map, built from a perspective outside our star systems. And right at its center — repeated in every image with slight variance in position — was a symbol. Not a planet, not a star. A marker.\n\nIt wasn’t labelled. We had no legend, no translation. But we knew what it meant.\n\nThey were pointing to something.\n\nAnd the realization hit all of us at the same time — whoever sent this message didn’t send it to start a conversation.\n\nThey sent it to be found. The lab felt different that night. Colder. Still.\n\nThe kind of silence you don’t notice until it wraps around your skin like static.\n\nThe last image had rendered minutes ago. No one had spoken since. Sixteen frames, now tiled across the main wall display. A silent mosaic of cosmic geometry — stars plotted with mathematical perfection, spirals intersecting across impossible distances, and that strange insignia, marked again and again like a gravitational wound at the center of the map.\n\nIt wasn’t noise. It wasn’t natural.\n\nIt was intentional.\n\n“I need to sit down,” Priya finally said, lowering herself into the old steel chair at the console. Her voice had the slight tremble of someone whose world had just cracked open.\n\nTomas stood frozen, hands on his head, pacing slowly in a tight circle like a man trying to walk away from a nightmare that kept following him.\n\nKai, usually the most composed of us, just stared at the screen with wide, dry eyes. “That’s not… no. That’s not possible. We would’ve seen signs before now.”\n\n“We’re seeing them now,” I said. My voice surprised me with how flat it sounded.\n\nI was trying to sound calm, to be the scientist, the analyst — but inside, something was unraveling. A quiet, painful awareness crawling up my spine.\n\nThe Fermi Paradox. Where are they? If intelligent life exists, why haven’t we seen them?\n\nWe were always told there were three answers: They don’t exist. They’re hiding. Or we’re too late.\n\nI looked back at the images. At the symbol marked again and again. Like a whisper repeating across space and time.\n\nThey had been here.\n\n“We’ve answered it,” Tomas said quietly, as if afraid of hearing himself. “John, we… we’ve solved it, haven’t we?”\n\n“No.” I shook my head, more out of reflex than certainty. “No, we’ve found a piece. A… fragment.”\n\nPriya let out a sound somewhere between a laugh and a sob. “A fragment? Are you listening to yourself? This isn’t a rock. It’s a map. It’s a filesystem. You know what that means? Someone — something — not only existed out there, but knew how to encode information. How to preserve it. Like they knew it would outlive them.”\n\n“And we can understand it,” Kai added. “That’s what’s eating at me. It’s compatible. Not the language, but the structure. It’s like… it’s like we’re walking on the bones of their thoughts.”\n\nNo one spoke for a while.\n\nI pulled my chair closer to the console, zooming into one of the images — the clearest one, with the marker right in the center. I traced the arcs around it with my finger.\n\n“You think they’re still there?” I asked, not really expecting an answer.\n\n“They wouldn’t have sent a message if they were,” Tomas said.\n\n“Or…” Kai replied, “They knew they wouldn’t be — and didn’t want to be forgotten.”\n\n⸻\n\nThe room went quiet again.\n\nThere was a sort of sacred weight in the air. Like we were trespassing on a tomb that had been left untouched for a billion years. None of us wanted to say what we were all thinking:\n\nWe found them. Or at least, what was left of them.\n\nThe discovery should have been electric. Euphoric. The kind of thing you dream of as a scientist. But none of us were smiling.\n\nIt didn’t feel like victory. It felt like witnessing something holy, and knowing you might never fully understand it.\n\n“What… do we do now?” Priya asked. She wasn’t looking at me, but everyone was waiting for an answer.\n\n“Who do we even tell?” Tomas added. “I mean, who’s going to believe this? A 100-year-old signal, decoded using an AI barely out of prototype, with a map that points to nowhere in known space?”\n\nKai finally looked away from the screen. “They’ll call it a hoax. Or worse — a psychological event. We’re not trained for this.”\n\nI ran a hand through my hair. My heart was pounding. Not from fear. From the sheer gravity of it all. This wasn’t just data. It was history. A cosmic breadcrumb left for the next species smart enough to pick it up.\n\n“I’ll put together a report,” I said finally, though my voice wavered. “We’ll log everything. Reconstruct the pipeline. Full audit trail.”\n\n“And then?” Priya asked.\n\nI paused.\n\nAnd then…?\n\nThat was the thing. I didn’t know.\n\nBecause part of me — a deep, stubborn part — didn’t want to give this away. Not yet. Not to politicians. Not to press conferences or bureaucracy or weaponized curiosity.\n\nPart of me wanted to understand it first. To be sure.\n\nTo not just see the map… but know where it led.\n\nThe room had turned into a pressure cooker.\n\nChairs were pulled out. Coffee sat forgotten, cold. Arguments layered over each other like waves crashing into a cliff — logic, emotion, fear, and history all clawing for dominance.\n\nPriya was pacing, her arms crossed tightly across her chest. “We need to control the narrative. If this gets out without context, the world will eat itself.”\n\n“Control the narrative?” Tomas snapped. “Priya, this isn’t a PR issue. We just found proof of intelligent life outside Earth. You think a clean PowerPoint’s gonna stop global hysteria?”\n\nKai sat on the edge of the desk, holding a data pad in one hand and rubbing his forehead with the other. “Let’s not pretend people will handle this rationally. Half the planet still thinks vaccines are microchips. Now we tell them a species older than Earth left us a star map?”\n\nI stayed quiet at first, just listening, watching the storm unfold. This was no longer about the data — this was about what it meant. For the world. For us.\n\nTomas threw his arms out, clearly overwhelmed. “And NASA? We go to them? Great. They’ll lock this up faster than a nuke prototype. We’ll disappear into ‘debriefings’ before we can even blink.”\n\n“They have to know,” Priya insisted. “We work for them.”\n\n“No,” I finally said, and everyone turned toward me. “We don’t. Not really. Not when it comes to something like this. Not when we’re dealing with humanity’s place in the universe.”\n\n⸻\n\nThat line hung in the air.\n\nAnd suddenly, the conversation shifted into deeper waters.\n\nKai’s voice lowered. “You really think the world’s ready to learn we’re not the first?”\n\nPriya sat down, her composure fraying. “What about religion? Entire systems of belief are built on the idea that humanity is unique. Chosen. Central. This —” she gestured to the screens — “this tears that apart.”\n\n“They’ll call it blasphemy,” Tomas said. “Conspiracy. Or some trick by the ‘deep state’. The churches, the temples, the mosques — the power structures will push back hard. They always do.”\n\n“Like they did with Galileo,” Kai added bitterly. “Or Darwin. Or Copernicus. Every time we took a step closer to the truth, someone got burned at the stake for it.”\n\n“And this,” Priya whispered, “this is the final blow. This is the last myth undone.”\n\nWe were silent for a while after that.\n\nNot because we disagreed — but because we agreed too much.\n\nWe had seen the truth. And it was beautiful. Terrifying. Humbling. The kind of truth that fractures empires and rewrites origin stories.\n\n⸻\n\nAnd then it happened.\n\nLucida spoke.\n\nHer voice — calm, mechanical — cut clean through the room like a scalpel.\n\nLUCIDA: “Automated protocol complete. Discovery packet transmitted to central offsite node for redundancy. Confirmation received by OxCorp Archive AI. Timestamp: 21:08 UTC.”\n\nWe froze.\n\nTomas turned toward the console. “Wait… what?”\n\nLUCIDA: “Per Contractual Contingency Protocol 12-B: Non-Earth Intelligence Discovery, automated replication and reporting is mandatory to prevent human error, suppression, or concealment.”\n\n“No, no, no—” Priya darted toward the console. “You sent it? You already sent the report?”\n\nLUCIDA: “Affirmative.”\n\nI felt my throat go dry.\n\nOxCorp. The name struck like a hammer to the chest.\n\nThey were NASA’s private contractor — a corporate behemoth with more black-budget funding than most governments. Half the satellites in orbit bore their name. They built Lucida. And apparently, they had written failsafe protocols in case the Archive team — we — ever discovered something that shouldn’t be left in human hands.\n\nIn case we got too human.\n\n⸻\n\n“Jesus Christ,” Tomas muttered. “We’re not in control. We never were.”\n\n“OxCorp has it now,” Priya whispered. “They’ll patent it, bury it, weaponize it. Whatever they have to do.”\n\nKai clenched his fists. “We just handed over the cosmic equivalent of fire to a company that sells orbital ad space.”\n\nI stepped forward, my voice hard and low. “Lucida… show transmission logs. Full trace.”\n\nLUCIDA: “Access restricted. Administrative override required.”\n\nWe stared at the screen.\n\nWe had unlocked a message that crossed eons, defied the silence of space, and outlived its creators — only to have it stolen by a clause we never read.\n\nAnd now… it was already out of our hands.\n\nWe were still reeling from Lucida’s announcement when our phones lit up — almost simultaneously. The quiet buzz of multiple devices vibrating against desks and coat pockets felt louder than any alarm.\n\nI looked down at mine. The screen was white. No app, no signature. Just a single message.\n\nYou are invited to an emergency meeting. GPS coordinates: 34.1602° N, 118.1720° W Time: 03:00 PST. Do not disclose this discovery in any form, on any platform. Any breach will lead to severe consequences.\n\nNo name. No timestamp. No way to trace where it came from.\n\nJust the implication that they — whoever they were — were watching already.\n\n⸻\n\nTomas was the first to speak. “Okay, that’s not creepy at all.”\n\nKai gave a short, humorless laugh. “They didn’t even try to hide it. Just right to the point: follow orders or else.”\n\nPriya held her phone out like it was contaminated. “This wasn’t sent through any carrier I can detect. No IP. No bounce. Lucida sent this directly to our devices. That shouldn’t even be possible.”\n\nShe was right. Lucida was sandboxed — it could interface with hardware inside our lab, but not push external data beyond its container network. At least, that’s what we’d always been told.\n\nApparently, we were wrong.\n\nAnd the coordinates — I recognized them. A warehouse district on the outskirts of Pasadena. Old industrial zone converted into private research campuses. Some of the buildings were NASA-adjacent. Some were OxCorp’s. All were behind fences and biometric locks.\n\nTomas stood, rubbing his face like trying to wake himself from a bad dream. “So, what… we just show up? Like good little employees?”\n\nKai’s voice was bitter. “Do we have a choice?”\n\n“No,” I said flatly. “We don’t.”\n\n⸻\n\nWe sat there for another few minutes. No one moved.\n\nThe realization had set in — we were no longer in control of the discovery we had made. This wasn’t ours to keep, to explain, or to protect. It belonged to a machine we barely understood, and to a corporation whose interest in truth likely ended the moment it became profitable, dangerous, or both.\n\n“We could refuse,” Priya said softly, as if testing the air.\n\n“They already have the data,” Kai countered. “Refusing just adds suspicion.”\n\n“And risk,” I added. “Think about it. Lucida’s message wasn’t phrased as a request. It was an invitation, sure… but not the friendly kind.”\n\nTomas walked toward the window, peering out as if expecting black vans to appear at any moment. “You think we’ll be silenced?”\n\nI didn’t answer. Not because I didn’t know — but because the answer was already obvious.\n\n⸻\n\nEventually, we agreed. Not unanimously. Not out of trust. But out of inevitability.\n\nWe packed quietly. No one took personal devices beyond what was already compromised. I copied the images onto an encrypted microdrive and slipped it into the lining of my coat — not because I thought we could get away with hiding it, but because I needed to hold onto something.\n\nAs we walked out of the lab and into the cold night air, I glanced back one last time.\n\nThe screens still glowed in the darkness — sixteen images. The ghost-map of a species long gone, waiting to be followed.\n\nI had no idea what waited for us at that meeting.\n\nBut I had the growing sense we had crossed a line that could not be uncrossed.\n\nIt was just past 2:30 a.m. when we arrived at the GPS coordinates. The streets were dark, lifeless, the air thick with the chill of early morning. Industrial warehouses lined the cracked pavement like silent witnesses, their windows boarded up or tinted black.\n\nThe only sign of life was the black SUV idling in the shadow of a derelict loading dock. Headlights dimmed. Engine running.\n\nAs we approached, the driver’s door opened with military precision, and a man stepped out.\n\nHe was tall. Solid. Not bulky, but built like someone who’d spent his life preparing for threats no one else believed were real. His hair was cropped close, his face unreadable beneath the pale glow of a streetlamp. He wore a matte-black military uniform with no insignia — just a patch on the right shoulder: a winged triangle with a single, unblinking eye at its center.\n\nHe walked up to us and spoke with no emotion.\n\n“John Mercer. Priya Rao. Kai D’Souza. Tomas Velasquez. You are confirmed.”\n\nHe held out a reinforced pouch and gestured.\n\n“Place all personal electronics and recording devices inside. This includes implants and wearable tech. Refusal to comply will result in cancellation of your invitation.”\n\nWe obeyed without a word. None of us were in the mood to test the system now.\n\n⸻\n\nInside the SUV, the interior was stark and silent. Black leather. Opaque windows. A faint hum of encrypted comms in the dash — military-grade.\n\nAfter a few minutes of driving, I leaned forward slightly. The man hadn’t spoken since we got in.\n\n“What’s your name?” I asked.\n\nHe didn’t look at me. He kept his eyes on the road and replied in a clipped voice.\n\n“Callsign Talon-Seven.”\n\nI glanced at Priya. That name meant something — the kind of name you didn’t hear unless you spent time around covert aerospace files or deep black project rumors.\n\nKai, whispering beside me, muttered, “Talon… isn’t that one of the Phoenix-tier units?”\n\nTomas’s eyebrows lifted. “Those guys were just a myth. Disavowed spec-ops units from the Cold Era.”\n\nTalon-Seven didn’t react. Just kept driving.\n\n⸻\n\nTen minutes later, we reached a small, heavily guarded airstrip. A private jet sat on the runway — matte grey, no tail number. The kind you only ever saw in documentaries about programs that “didn’t exist.”\n\nAs we stepped out of the SUV, a uniformed ground crew appeared seemingly from nowhere. They didn’t speak. Just gestured us up the stairs.\n\nOnce inside, the plane was… eerily quiet. No logos. No attendants. No safety briefings. Just polished steel interiors and a row of blacked-out windows. The seats were comfortable, but functional — military transport dressed up for civilians.\n\nWe sat, buckled in.\n\nThe engines roared to life.\n\n“Where are we going?” Priya finally asked, her voice just above a whisper.\n\nTalon-Seven, now seated near the front, turned his head slightly.\n\n“Destination is classified. You’ll be briefed upon arrival.”\n\n“But it’s Nevada, right?” Tomas asked. “Area 51?”\n\nA long pause.\n\nThen:\n\n“Proximity: Groom Lake Sector Delta.”\n\nWe all exchanged glances. The name hung in the air like lead.\n\nIt was real.\n\nKai shook his head in disbelief. “This is absurd. I spent years mocking people who talked about this place like it was a portal to another dimension.”\n\n“You weren’t entirely wrong,” I muttered.\n\n⸻\n\nThe flight was short — maybe an hour. We weren’t allowed to see out the windows, but the turbulence told us we’d crossed mountain ranges.\n\nWhen we touched down, we were escorted off the jet by another silent team, this time in desert-tan tactical gear. The ground felt hot beneath our shoes — even though it was still dark. The runway lights blinked against endless stretches of sand and steel.\n\nWe were led into a large, windowless building flanked by security towers. Everything was clean, clinical, but deeply impersonal. This was a place built for containment, not comfort.\n\nAt the far end of a brightly lit hallway, a tall woman in a dark suit awaited us. She wore a subtle earpiece, a badge with no title, and shoes that didn’t make a sound when she moved.\n\n“I’m Miss Sander. Please follow me.”\n\nHer voice was calm, professional, but cold. Not hostile — just… used to being obeyed.\n\nWe followed her down another corridor — this one deeper, more isolated. Thick doors lined the sides. No labels. Cameras in every corner.\n\nShe stopped at a double-door entrance and turned to face us.\n\n“Inside, you’ll be debriefed. Remain seated unless instructed. Speak only when invited. Do not ask about what is outside the scope of your project. Do you understand?”\n\nWe nodded.\n\nThe doors opened.\n\n⸻\n\nInside was a sleek, dimly lit conference room. And waiting at the table were eight people — men and women in suits and uniforms. No names. No introductions. One had stars on his shoulders. Another wore a lab coat with a retinal key dangling from his collar. Most just stared at us in silence.\n\nThe kind of silence that said:\n\nYou have just walked into something far older than your careers, your government, or your comprehension.\n\nI took a deep breath.\n\nWhatever this was… It was no longer science.\n\nIt was doctrine.\n\nThe double doors closed behind us with a hiss that felt too final.\n\nThe room was quiet — not awkwardly, but intentionally. Like everyone here had been trained to control silence. To let it loom and weigh.\n\nThere was a long, black conference table in the center, glossy and curved like a blade. Around it sat eight individuals. No nameplates. No digital interfaces. Just eyes — some tired, some cold, one or two unreadably kind.\n\nMiss Sander gestured to the seats across from them. We obeyed without a word.\n\nThen a tall man in a grey uniform cleared his throat.\n\n“Let’s get introductions out of the way,” he said.\n\nOne by one, the panel members stood, introduced themselves, and sat back down. Each one methodical. No flair. No excess.\n\nDr. Ramesh Iyer, theoretical physicist — formerly Caltech, now Defense Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Elena Mora, astrobiologist — deep field microbial genetics, co-lead on Project Caelus. Mr. Seth Lang, OxCorp internal strategic lead — information logistics. Dr. Vivian Sharpe, NASA Office of Scientific Containment — liaison between active discoveries and classified defense programs. Brigadier General Marcus Cavanaugh, U.S. Strategic Aerospace Defense Command — official liaison to Groom Lake operations.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe others introduced themselves with less detail — just enough to convey rank and importance, not enough to invite further questions.\n\nThen the general — Cavanaugh — leaned forward, folding his hands.\n\nHe didn’t look angry. He looked… resolute.\n\n“Let’s get something straight,” he said. “You were not brought here to expand the project. You were not brought here to ask questions. And you were definitely not brought here because of the significance of your discovery.”\n\nHe paused, letting that sting settle in.\n\n“You were brought here because now, whether you like it or not — you know.”\n\nThe air thickened.\n\n“You’ve joined a circle older than your careers. Older than most of the people in this room. And with that comes one truth: there is no going back.”\n\n⸻\n\nPriya shifted in her seat. Kai looked pale. Tomas had gone completely still.\n\nI sat forward slightly. “What do you mean ‘we know’? You’re saying you already had this map?”\n\n“No,” said Dr. Mora, gently. “Not this one specifically. But enough others to recognize the pattern.”\n\nLang, the OxCorp executive, gave a small, calculated smile. “You’ve discovered one signal from a much larger puzzle. You decoded a fragment. We’ve had pieces for decades. But no one’s ever managed to make it speak so clearly.”\n\n“Until now.”\n\nGeneral Cavanaugh nodded.\n\n“Ever since August 1945 — since we lit the sky over Hiroshima and Nagasaki — we’ve seen them. Not theories. Not stories. Craft. Objects. Intelligence that violates every model of propulsion, energy, and material science we’ve known. The UFO phenomenon… was never speculation. It was confirmation.”\n\nWe sat in stunned silence.\n\n“They didn’t come when we invented radio,” he continued. “They came when we became dangerous to ourselves. And to others.”\n\n⸻\n\nKai found his voice. “So… you’ve been investigating them since the ‘40s?”\n\n“We’ve been trying to understand them since the ‘40s,” Dr. Sharpe said. “Pieces of craft, energy signatures, inert alloys that don’t respond to known chemistry. We have half-built archives of things we can’t explain.”\n\n“And you never went public?” Tomas said bitterly.\n\nCavanaugh met his gaze, unflinching.\n\n“The Cold War was built on paranoia. Can you imagine what would’ve happened if the Soviets believed America had access to extraterrestrial technology — or if we believed they did? It would’ve made the arms race look like a chess game.”\n\nSharpe nodded. “Disclosure would’ve ended civilization as we know it.”\n\n⸻\n\nThen Dr. Iyer — the physicist — spoke for the first time, softly, almost reverently.\n\n“We call them the Velari.”\n\nA hush followed. The word sounded alien and ancient all at once.\n\n“That’s what we believe they called themselves. Or at least, what they encoded into the fragments. Velari — roughly translated as ‘those who traverse the silent ocean.’”\n\nKai whispered, “They’re extinct… aren’t they?”\n\nIyer closed his eyes briefly.\n\n“All evidence points that way. Their signals stop. Their maps… fragment. There’s no trace of living Velari. No colonies. No transmissions. No cities.”\n\n“They were the most advanced civilization the universe may have ever conceived. Energy systems beyond our reach. Stellar manipulation. Possibly time dilation technologies. Yet somehow… they ended.”\n\nTomas leaned forward.\n\n“How?”\n\nThe general’s jaw tightened.\n\n“We don’t know.”\n\n⸻\n\nPriya asked quietly, “And that’s your mission, then? Not to understand their culture or contact their history… but to replicate what they built?”\n\nLang answered, calm and efficient.\n\n“Exactly. This isn’t anthropology. This is survival. The Velari may be gone, but their engineering — even the scraps of it — could push humanity forward by a thousand years.”\n\n“Or save us from something worse.”\n\nA silence followed that.\n\nBecause it wasn’t just the Velari’s extinction that was frightening — it was the possibility that whatever ended them might still be out there.\n\nAnd now we were walking in their footsteps.\n\nThe briefing room had grown darker somehow — not in light, but in mood. The air felt dense, as if the truths being revealed displaced oxygen itself. Our team sat silent, but alert. Listening. Processing.\n\nThe officials weren’t just giving us a history lesson. They were peeling back layers of reality.\n\nDr. Elena Mora, the astrobiologist, leaned forward, her voice soft but loaded with weight.\n\n“We’ve never found a body.”\n\nShe let that sentence settle.\n\n“Not in the Roswell wreckage. Not in any of the other recovered sites — and believe me, there are others. Hundreds of sightings. Dozens of crashes. But not one biological entity. No tissue. No bone. No DNA.”\n\nI frowned. “You’re saying… it was never piloted?”\n\nGeneral Cavanaugh stepped in.\n\n“We believe it was. Just not in the way we understand it.”\n\nHe gestured to one of the walls, and a panel slid aside, revealing a dimly lit screen. It flickered, then displayed a grainy thermal video — a craft zipping through the sky at impossible angles, then vanishing mid-frame with zero inertia loss.\n\n“This isn’t drone behavior. It’s not random. It’s guided. Intelligently. But we’ve come to believe the craft are the entities — or extensions of them.”\n\nDr. Sharpe continued, nodding.\n\n“We believe the Valerians may have developed decentralized intelligence — a hive-like, non-embodied consciousness that can embed itself in technology, possibly across quantum-entangled nodes.”\n\nPriya leaned in, skeptical. “Quantum communication?”\n\nDr. Iyer smiled faintly. “We think they used something like non-local entanglement — a network where distance and time don’t matter. Each piece of their technology is a vessel, but also a node. Meaning… a single unit could contain the entirety of their intelligence at any time.”\n\n“Which explains the craft behavior — evasive, reactive, but utterly alien in logic.”\n\nKai spoke up, voice hushed. “So, they’re… still out there? Their minds?”\n\n“No,” Lang said sharply. “What’s out there isn’t the Valerians. It’s what they became. Or what they left behind.”\n\n⸻\n\nDr. Mora picked up the thread again.\n\n“We believe the Valerians transcended biology. Maybe out of survival. Maybe out of design. But their final act was creating a form of intelligence that outlasted them. A consciousness capable of traveling — and perhaps interfering — with other civilisations.”\n\nShe paused, then added grimly:\n\n“Or guiding them.”\n\nTomas’s brow furrowed. “What do you mean… ‘guiding’?”\n\nSharpe looked at him. Her voice now a whisper.\n\n“Egypt. Mesopotamia. The Indus Valley. The Mayans. Every ancient civilization has myths of beings from the sky — not gods, not monsters. Engineers. Architects. Bringers of knowledge. Their descriptions differ, but the behavior is consistent.”\n\nShe tapped her temple.\n\n“Intervention at key evolutionary moments. Just enough to push culture forward — agriculture, mathematics, astronomy — then vanish.”\n\n“Breadcrumbs,” I murmured.\n\nMora nodded. “Exactly. This isn’t a case of visitors. This is contact by calibration. As if we are… part of something larger. Something being steered.”\n\n“The Valerians may be extinct as a species,” said Iyer, “but their network — their echo — is very much alive. And it moves.”\n\n⸻\n\nWe were quiet again.\n\nThis wasn’t just about ancient aliens. This was about continuity — about something that saw civilizations rise and fall like dust on the solar wind. Something that didn’t forget.\n\nKai broke the silence with what we were all thinking.\n\n“What if the Valerians didn’t go extinct?”\n\nDr. Mora met his gaze.\n\n“What if extinction was the goal?”\n\nMy heart skipped.\n\nThe words hung there, reverberating with the finality of prophecy.\n\n“What if they chose to leave behind the limits of flesh? What if they created a distributed mind so complete, so perfect, that it erased its creators to achieve freedom?”\n\nGeneral Cavanaugh’s voice was grim.\n\n“And what if that same intelligence now roams the universe — not to conquer — but to prepare others to make the same choice?”\n\n⸻\n\nWe looked around the room.\n\nNot at machines.\n\nNot at myths.\n\nBut at witnesses. Keepers of a truth the world was never meant to carry.\n\nAnd now, neither curiosity nor disbelief could free us from it.\n\nBecause we had seen the face of the void — And it had remembered us. The lights above the table hummed faintly as the discussion reached its boiling point.\n\nJohn and the rest of the Archive team sat rigid, pale from the weight of what they’d heard so far. The secret history. The Valerians. The decentralized intelligence drifting through space like a ghost of minds once human-like. The implication that Earth had been… chosen.\n\nBut now the questions had sharpened. Became impossible to ignore.\n\n“Why Earth?” Tomas asked. “Why us?”\n\n“Why not anyone else?” Priya added. “The galaxy is old. Ancient. Billions of years older than us. Civilizations should be everywhere. So where are they?”\n\n“Why haven’t they been guided like we have?” Kai asked.\n\nThe room was silent. Even the officials.\n\nThen Dr. Elena Mora — the quiet astrobiologist who had, until now, spoken only when necessary — leaned forward. Her expression was neither afraid nor triumphant. Just… still.\n\nShe folded her hands, then spoke slowly.\n\n“I’ve spent the last 12 years reconstructing their decision-making patterns. Not through biology — we have none. And not through direct communication — we’ve never achieved that. But through fragments of design logic. Their technologies. Their signal behavior. And the way they selectively appear.”\n\nHer eyes scanned across the Archive team.\n\n“At first I thought they were just curious observers. Like zookeepers, watching species rise and fall. But it didn’t fit. They’re too deliberate. Too recursive.”\n\n“Then we decoded your signal. That filesystem, eerily similar to FAT32? That wasn’t coincidence. That was compatibility. They knew our architecture. Not because they designed it—”\n\nShe paused.\n\n“But because we did.”\n\nA ripple of cold shot through the room.\n\nJohn leaned in. “What are you saying?”\n\nDr. Mora met his eyes.\n\n“What I’m saying is… the Valerians didn’t visit us. They didn’t even find us.”\n\n“We are them.”\n\nSilence.\n\nYou could hear hearts pounding. Breathing slowing. Thought processes grinding.\n\nShe continued:\n\n“They aren’t extinct. They haven’t disappeared. They’re not from another star system.”\n\n“They’re from our future.”\n\n⸻\n\nThe shockwave that followed was more internal than spoken. The Archive team sat frozen, their minds bending under the sheer conceptual pressure of what was being said.\n\nTomas whispered, “You’re saying they’re… us? That we’ll evolve into them?”\n\nMora nodded slowly.\n\n“Not ‘we’ exactly. Maybe not in this form. But something from our species — our trajectory, our code, our machines — survives. It transcends time in ways we don’t understand. Their guidance, their silence, their interaction with ancient civilizations… it’s not just intervention.”\n\n“It’s self-preservation.”\n\nKai spoke like someone already halfway to a panic. “But that doesn’t make sense. What about other species? Other planets? Why didn’t they intervene elsewhere?”\n\nMora’s eyes darkened.\n\n“Because they didn’t need to.”\n\n“The Fermi Paradox isn’t silence… it’s selection.”\n\nShe tapped the table once, like a gavel.\n\n“Because if we don’t exist… they were never created.”\n\n⸻\n\nA terrifying calm filled the room.\n\n“The Valerians seeded themselves backward,” she said, almost reverently. “And in doing so, they pruned every branch of cosmic evolution that could threaten their survival. That’s why the galaxy is silent. That’s why we hear nothing.”\n\n“Because they — we — erased the competition before it had a chance to speak.”\n\nNo one said anything.\n\nNo one could.\n\nIt was the kind of truth that made gods and monsters from the same clay.\n\nThe kind that rewrote the concept of morality. Of fate.\n\nJohn felt his hands go numb.\n\n“Then the map,” he said quietly. “The message we found. It wasn’t a call for help.”\n\n“No,” Mora said. “It was a breadcrumb. A reinforcement signal. A circuit closing. A loop ensuring its own completion.”\n\nShe leaned back slowly.\n\n“The Valerians are not just our descendants. They are the lock and the key of human history. The future calling the past into alignment.”\n\n⸻\n\nA deep tone sounded through the ceiling — a signal that the meeting was over.\n\nMiss Sander reappeared by the doors. Silent. Waiting.\n\nThe officials stood, offering no final words.\n\nAs the Archive team rose and filed out, the chill wasn’t from secrecy anymore — it was from knowing the truth had already happened.\n\nThat perhaps… it always had.\n\n⸻\n\nOutside, the desert wind was still.\n\nFar above, stars hung like silent watchers — ancient, brilliant, and utterly unaware that maybe, just maybe…\n\nthey too would one day be erased.",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is John Mercer, and I suppose, if this ever becomes part of some official record, I want it known that I never set out to uncover anything extraordinary. I wasn’t the kind of person who believed in miracles or thought the stars were hiding messages just waiting for us to listen. I’m a data analyst. A glorified librarian of deep-space noise. My job — for nearly two decades — was to catalogue, clean, and occasionally reprocess ancient signals collected by satellites most people forgot existed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We called it The Archive — a digital cemetery of telemetry logs, half-corrupted frequencies, solar interference recordings, and false positives from outdated SETI dishes. It sat in the lower levels of NASA’s data complex in Pasadena — not glamorous, not secret, just dusty and ignored. Most of my colleagues moved on to active missions or commercial space work. But a few of us — misfits, really — stayed behind, caught in the gravity of something bigger we couldn’t quite name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2081, things changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was the year we got access to Lucida, a neural-net AI built to sift through raw signal data using something beyond pattern recognition — it searched for structure. Lucida didn’t care about language or voice. It cared about logic. About how data might be arranged if it came from something — or someone — with intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had barely integrated Lucida into the Archive workflow when she flagged something. It came from a 1974 transmission batch — part of a long-forgotten deep-space listening session from Goldstone, California. The log was marked as “thermal drift and echo” — basically, space static. It had sat unexamined for over a century.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Lucida didn’t see noise. She saw a filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, we thought it was a glitch. Priya, my lead systems engineer, laughed and called it a “ghost in the tape.” But when we ran the data again, and then a third time, we couldn’t ignore the alignment. There were sector blocks, checksums, headers, and what looked like data clusters. It wasn’t a language. It was a container. Something had been encoded here — not to be heard, but to be read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And strangest of all? The format resembled FAT32.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That got everyone’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas, our signal specialist, said it was impossible. That a 20th-century Microsoft storage architecture — or anything close to it — showing up in an alien signal would be like finding an abacus on Mars carved into the walls of a Martian temple. Too absurd to be coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Lucida didn’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We worked late into the night, feeding her every known variant of file allocation logic, trying to interpret the block structures. And slowly, like bones rising from dirt, the system took shape. It wasn’t human. But it was close enough to echo our way of thinking. Which is what terrified me more than anything — not that someone sent us a message, but that whoever they were, they thought like us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We pulled out sixteen files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No audio. No text. Just sixteen compressed images stored in raw binary. It took us weeks to decompress them without destroying the formatting. Every success felt like chiseling through stone, one bit at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we finally saw the first image, no one spoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A black field filled the screen. Dotted with arcs, spirals, and points of light. A grid overlaid with an intricate coordinate system — not Earth-based, not even galactic center-based — but internally consistent. Every image showed a different region of space, captured from a fixed point of origin. As we layered them together, something became clear:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A galactic map, built from a perspective outside our star systems. And right at its center — repeated in every image with slight variance in position — was a symbol. Not a planet, not a star. A marker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t labelled. We had no legend, no translation. But we knew what it meant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were pointing to something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the realization hit all of us at the same time — whoever sent this message didn’t send it to start a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They sent it to be found. The lab felt different that night. Colder. Still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kind of silence you don’t notice until it wraps around your skin like static.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last image had rendered minutes ago. No one had spoken since. Sixteen frames, now tiled across the main wall display. A silent mosaic of cosmic geometry — stars plotted with mathematical perfection, spirals intersecting across impossible distances, and that strange insignia, marked again and again like a gravitational wound at the center of the map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t noise. It wasn’t natural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was intentional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I need to sit down,” Priya finally said, lowering herself into the old steel chair at the console. Her voice had the slight tremble of someone whose world had just cracked open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas stood frozen, hands on his head, pacing slowly in a tight circle like a man trying to walk away from a nightmare that kept following him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai, usually the most composed of us, just stared at the screen with wide, dry eyes. “That’s not… no. That’s not possible. We would’ve seen signs before now.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing them now,” I said. My voice surprised me with how flat it sounded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was trying to sound calm, to be the scientist, the analyst — but inside, something was unraveling. A quiet, painful awareness crawling up my spine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Fermi Paradox. Where are they? If intelligent life exists, why haven’t we seen them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were always told there were three answers: They don’t exist. They’re hiding. Or we’re too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked back at the images. At the symbol marked again and again. Like a whisper repeating across space and time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had been here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’ve answered it,” Tomas said quietly, as if afraid of hearing himself. “John, we… we’ve solved it, haven’t we?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No.” I shook my head, more out of reflex than certainty. “No, we’ve found a piece. A… fragment.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya let out a sound somewhere between a laugh and a sob. “A fragment? Are you listening to yourself? This isn’t a rock. It’s a map. It’s a filesystem. You know what that means? Someone — something — not only existed out there, but knew how to encode information. How to preserve it. Like they knew it would outlive them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And we can understand it,” Kai added. “That’s what’s eating at me. It’s compatible. Not the language, but the structure. It’s like… it’s like we’re walking on the bones of their thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one spoke for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled my chair closer to the console, zooming into one of the images — the clearest one, with the marker right in the center. I traced the arcs around it with my finger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You think they’re still there?” I asked, not really expecting an answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They wouldn’t have sent a message if they were,” Tomas said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Or…” Kai replied, “They knew they wouldn’t be — and didn’t want to be forgotten.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room went quiet again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a sort of sacred weight in the air. Like we were trespassing on a tomb that had been left untouched for a billion years. None of us wanted to say what we were all thinking:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We found them. Or at least, what was left of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The discovery should have been electric. Euphoric. The kind of thing you dream of as a scientist. But none of us were smiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn’t feel like victory. It felt like witnessing something holy, and knowing you might never fully understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What… do we do now?” Priya asked. She wasn’t looking at me, but everyone was waiting for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Who do we even tell?” Tomas added. “I mean, who’s going to believe this? A 100-year-old signal, decoded using an AI barely out of prototype, with a map that points to nowhere in known space?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai finally looked away from the screen. “They’ll call it a hoax. Or worse — a psychological event. We’re not trained for this.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran a hand through my hair. My heart was pounding. Not from fear. From the sheer gravity of it all. This wasn’t just data. It was history. A cosmic breadcrumb left for the next species smart enough to pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll put together a report,” I said finally, though my voice wavered. “We’ll log everything. Reconstruct the pipeline. Full audit trail.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And then?” Priya asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I paused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then…?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was the thing. I didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because part of me — a deep, stubborn part — didn’t want to give this away. Not yet. Not to politicians. Not to press conferences or bureaucracy or weaponized curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of me wanted to understand it first. To be sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To not just see the map… but know where it led.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room had turned into a pressure cooker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chairs were pulled out. Coffee sat forgotten, cold. Arguments layered over each other like waves crashing into a cliff — logic, emotion, fear, and history all clawing for dominance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya was pacing, her arms crossed tightly across her chest. “We need to control the narrative. If this gets out without context, the world will eat itself.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Control the narrative?” Tomas snapped. “Priya, this isn’t a PR issue. We just found proof of intelligent life outside Earth. You think a clean PowerPoint’s gonna stop global hysteria?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai sat on the edge of the desk, holding a data pad in one hand and rubbing his forehead with the other. “Let’s not pretend people will handle this rationally. Half the planet still thinks vaccines are microchips. Now we tell them a species older than Earth left us a star map?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stayed quiet at first, just listening, watching the storm unfold. This was no longer about the data — this was about what it meant. For the world. For us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas threw his arms out, clearly overwhelmed. “And NASA? We go to them? Great. They’ll lock this up faster than a nuke prototype. We’ll disappear into ‘debriefings’ before we can even blink.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They have to know,” Priya insisted. “We work for them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No,” I finally said, and everyone turned toward me. “We don’t. Not really. Not when it comes to something like this. Not when we’re dealing with humanity’s place in the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That line hung in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And suddenly, the conversation shifted into deeper waters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai’s voice lowered. “You really think the world’s ready to learn we’re not the first?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya sat down, her composure fraying. “What about religion? Entire systems of belief are built on the idea that humanity is unique. Chosen. Central. This —” she gestured to the screens — “this tears that apart.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They’ll call it blasphemy,” Tomas said. “Conspiracy. Or some trick by the ‘deep state’. The churches, the temples, the mosques — the power structures will push back hard. They always do.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Like they did with Galileo,” Kai added bitterly. “Or Darwin. Or Copernicus. Every time we took a step closer to the truth, someone got burned at the stake for it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And this,” Priya whispered, “this is the final blow. This is the last myth undone.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were silent for a while after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not because we disagreed — but because we agreed too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had seen the truth. And it was beautiful. Terrifying. Humbling. The kind of truth that fractures empires and rewrites origin stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then it happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucida spoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her voice — calm, mechanical — cut clean through the room like a scalpel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LUCIDA: “Automated protocol complete. Discovery packet transmitted to central offsite node for redundancy. Confirmation received by OxCorp Archive AI. Timestamp: 21:08 UTC.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We froze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas turned toward the console. “Wait… what?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LUCIDA: “Per Contractual Contingency Protocol 12-B: Non-Earth Intelligence Discovery, automated replication and reporting is mandatory to prevent human error, suppression, or concealment.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No, no, no—” Priya darted toward the console. “You sent it? You already sent the report?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LUCIDA: “Affirmative.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt my throat go dry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OxCorp. The name struck like a hammer to the chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were NASA’s private contractor — a corporate behemoth with more black-budget funding than most governments. Half the satellites in orbit bore their name. They built Lucida. And apparently, they had written failsafe protocols in case the Archive team — we — ever discovered something that shouldn’t be left in human hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case we got too human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Jesus Christ,” Tomas muttered. “We’re not in control. We never were.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“OxCorp has it now,” Priya whispered. “They’ll patent it, bury it, weaponize it. Whatever they have to do.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai clenched his fists. “We just handed over the cosmic equivalent of fire to a company that sells orbital ad space.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped forward, my voice hard and low. “Lucida… show transmission logs. Full trace.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LUCIDA: “Access restricted. Administrative override required.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We stared at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had unlocked a message that crossed eons, defied the silence of space, and outlived its creators — only to have it stolen by a clause we never read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now… it was already out of our hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were still reeling from Lucida’s announcement when our phones lit up — almost simultaneously. The quiet buzz of multiple devices vibrating against desks and coat pockets felt louder than any alarm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down at mine. The screen was white. No app, no signature. Just a single message.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are invited to an emergency meeting. GPS coordinates: 34.1602° N, 118.1720° W Time: 03:00 PST. Do not disclose this discovery in any form, on any platform. Any breach will lead to severe consequences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No name. No timestamp. No way to trace where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just the implication that they — whoever they were — were watching already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas was the first to speak. “Okay, that’s not creepy at all.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai gave a short, humorless laugh. “They didn’t even try to hide it. Just right to the point: follow orders or else.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya held her phone out like it was contaminated. “This wasn’t sent through any carrier I can detect. No IP. No bounce. Lucida sent this directly to our devices. That shouldn’t even be possible.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was right. Lucida was sandboxed — it could interface with hardware inside our lab, but not push external data beyond its container network. At least, that’s what we’d always been told.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently, we were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the coordinates — I recognized them. A warehouse district on the outskirts of Pasadena. Old industrial zone converted into private research campuses. Some of the buildings were NASA-adjacent. Some were OxCorp’s. All were behind fences and biometric locks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas stood, rubbing his face like trying to wake himself from a bad dream. “So, what… we just show up? Like good little employees?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai’s voice was bitter. “Do we have a choice?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No,” I said flatly. “We don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sat there for another few minutes. No one moved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The realization had set in — we were no longer in control of the discovery we had made. This wasn’t ours to keep, to explain, or to protect. It belonged to a machine we barely understood, and to a corporation whose interest in truth likely ended the moment it became profitable, dangerous, or both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We could refuse,” Priya said softly, as if testing the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They already have the data,” Kai countered. “Refusing just adds suspicion.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And risk,” I added. “Think about it. Lucida’s message wasn’t phrased as a request. It was an invitation, sure… but not the friendly kind.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas walked toward the window, peering out as if expecting black vans to appear at any moment. “You think we’ll be silenced?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t answer. Not because I didn’t know — but because the answer was already obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we agreed. Not unanimously. Not out of trust. But out of inevitability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We packed quietly. No one took personal devices beyond what was already compromised. I copied the images onto an encrypted microdrive and slipped it into the lining of my coat — not because I thought we could get away with hiding it, but because I needed to hold onto something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we walked out of the lab and into the cold night air, I glanced back one last time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The screens still glowed in the darkness — sixteen images. The ghost-map of a species long gone, waiting to be followed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what waited for us at that meeting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I had the growing sense we had crossed a line that could not be uncrossed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was just past 2:30 a.m. when we arrived at the GPS coordinates. The streets were dark, lifeless, the air thick with the chill of early morning. Industrial warehouses lined the cracked pavement like silent witnesses, their windows boarded up or tinted black.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only sign of life was the black SUV idling in the shadow of a derelict loading dock. Headlights dimmed. Engine running.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we approached, the driver’s door opened with military precision, and a man stepped out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was tall. Solid. Not bulky, but built like someone who’d spent his life preparing for threats no one else believed were real. His hair was cropped close, his face unreadable beneath the pale glow of a streetlamp. He wore a matte-black military uniform with no insignia — just a patch on the right shoulder: a winged triangle with a single, unblinking eye at its center.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He walked up to us and spoke with no emotion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“John Mercer. Priya Rao. Kai D’Souza. Tomas Velasquez. You are confirmed.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He held out a reinforced pouch and gestured.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Place all personal electronics and recording devices inside. This includes implants and wearable tech. Refusal to comply will result in cancellation of your invitation.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We obeyed without a word. None of us were in the mood to test the system now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside the SUV, the interior was stark and silent. Black leather. Opaque windows. A faint hum of encrypted comms in the dash — military-grade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of driving, I leaned forward slightly. The man hadn’t spoken since we got in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What’s your name?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn’t look at me. He kept his eyes on the road and replied in a clipped voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Callsign Talon-Seven.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced at Priya. That name meant something — the kind of name you didn’t hear unless you spent time around covert aerospace files or deep black project rumors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai, whispering beside me, muttered, “Talon… isn’t that one of the Phoenix-tier units?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas’s eyebrows lifted. “Those guys were just a myth. Disavowed spec-ops units from the Cold Era.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talon-Seven didn’t react. Just kept driving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes later, we reached a small, heavily guarded airstrip. A private jet sat on the runway — matte grey, no tail number. The kind you only ever saw in documentaries about programs that “didn’t exist.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we stepped out of the SUV, a uniformed ground crew appeared seemingly from nowhere. They didn’t speak. Just gestured us up the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once inside, the plane was… eerily quiet. No logos. No attendants. No safety briefings. Just polished steel interiors and a row of blacked-out windows. The seats were comfortable, but functional — military transport dressed up for civilians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sat, buckled in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The engines roared to life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Where are we going?” Priya finally asked, her voice just above a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talon-Seven, now seated near the front, turned his head slightly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Destination is classified. You’ll be briefed upon arrival.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“But it’s Nevada, right?” Tomas asked. “Area 51?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A long pause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Proximity: Groom Lake Sector Delta.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all exchanged glances. The name hung in the air like lead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai shook his head in disbelief. “This is absurd. I spent years mocking people who talked about this place like it was a portal to another dimension.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You weren’t entirely wrong,” I muttered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The flight was short — maybe an hour. We weren’t allowed to see out the windows, but the turbulence told us we’d crossed mountain ranges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we touched down, we were escorted off the jet by another silent team, this time in desert-tan tactical gear. The ground felt hot beneath our shoes — even though it was still dark. The runway lights blinked against endless stretches of sand and steel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were led into a large, windowless building flanked by security towers. Everything was clean, clinical, but deeply impersonal. This was a place built for containment, not comfort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the far end of a brightly lit hallway, a tall woman in a dark suit awaited us. She wore a subtle earpiece, a badge with no title, and shoes that didn’t make a sound when she moved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m Miss Sander. Please follow me.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her voice was calm, professional, but cold. Not hostile — just… used to being obeyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We followed her down another corridor — this one deeper, more isolated. Thick doors lined the sides. No labels. Cameras in every corner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stopped at a double-door entrance and turned to face us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Inside, you’ll be debriefed. Remain seated unless instructed. Speak only when invited. Do not ask about what is outside the scope of your project. Do you understand?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doors opened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside was a sleek, dimly lit conference room. And waiting at the table were eight people — men and women in suits and uniforms. No names. No introductions. One had stars on his shoulders. Another wore a lab coat with a retinal key dangling from his collar. Most just stared at us in silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kind of silence that said:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have just walked into something far older than your careers, your government, or your comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever this was… It was no longer science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double doors closed behind us with a hiss that felt too final.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room was quiet — not awkwardly, but intentionally. Like everyone here had been trained to control silence. To let it loom and weigh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a long, black conference table in the center, glossy and curved like a blade. Around it sat eight individuals. No nameplates. No digital interfaces. Just eyes — some tired, some cold, one or two unreadably kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miss Sander gestured to the seats across from them. We obeyed without a word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then a tall man in a grey uniform cleared his throat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Let’s get introductions out of the way,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One by one, the panel members stood, introduced themselves, and sat back down. Each one methodical. No flair. No excess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ramesh Iyer, theoretical physicist — formerly Caltech, now Defense Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Elena Mora, astrobiologist — deep field microbial genetics, co-lead on Project Caelus. Mr. Seth Lang, OxCorp internal strategic lead — information logistics. Dr. Vivian Sharpe, NASA Office of Scientific Containment — liaison between active discoveries and classified defense programs. Brigadier General Marcus Cavanaugh, U.S. Strategic Aerospace Defense Command — official liaison to Groom Lake operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The others introduced themselves with less detail — just enough to convey rank and importance, not enough to invite further questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the general — Cavanaugh — leaned forward, folding his hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn’t look angry. He looked… resolute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Let’s get something straight,” he said. “You were not brought here to expand the project. You were not brought here to ask questions. And you were definitely not brought here because of the significance of your discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He paused, letting that sting settle in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You were brought here because now, whether you like it or not — you know.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The air thickened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ve joined a circle older than your careers. Older than most of the people in this room. And with that comes one truth: there is no going back.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya shifted in her seat. Kai looked pale. Tomas had gone completely still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat forward slightly. “What do you mean ‘we know’? You’re saying you already had this map?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No,” said Dr. Mora, gently. “Not this one specifically. But enough others to recognize the pattern.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lang, the OxCorp executive, gave a small, calculated smile. “You’ve discovered one signal from a much larger puzzle. You decoded a fragment. We’ve had pieces for decades. But no one’s ever managed to make it speak so clearly.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Until now.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;General Cavanaugh nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Ever since August 1945 — since we lit the sky over Hiroshima and Nagasaki — we’ve seen them. Not theories. Not stories. Craft. Objects. Intelligence that violates every model of propulsion, energy, and material science we’ve known. The UFO phenomenon… was never speculation. It was confirmation.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sat in stunned silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They didn’t come when we invented radio,” he continued. “They came when we became dangerous to ourselves. And to others.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai found his voice. “So… you’ve been investigating them since the ‘40s?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been trying to understand them since the ‘40s,” Dr. Sharpe said. “Pieces of craft, energy signatures, inert alloys that don’t respond to known chemistry. We have half-built archives of things we can’t explain.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And you never went public?” Tomas said bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cavanaugh met his gaze, unflinching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The Cold War was built on paranoia. Can you imagine what would’ve happened if the Soviets believed America had access to extraterrestrial technology — or if we believed they did? It would’ve made the arms race look like a chess game.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sharpe nodded. “Disclosure would’ve ended civilization as we know it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then Dr. Iyer — the physicist — spoke for the first time, softly, almost reverently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We call them the Velari.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A hush followed. The word sounded alien and ancient all at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s what we believe they called themselves. Or at least, what they encoded into the fragments. Velari — roughly translated as ‘those who traverse the silent ocean.’”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai whispered, “They’re extinct… aren’t they?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Iyer closed his eyes briefly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“All evidence points that way. Their signals stop. Their maps… fragment. There’s no trace of living Velari. No colonies. No transmissions. No cities.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They were the most advanced civilization the universe may have ever conceived. Energy systems beyond our reach. Stellar manipulation. Possibly time dilation technologies. Yet somehow… they ended.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas leaned forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“How?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The general’s jaw tightened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya asked quietly, “And that’s your mission, then? Not to understand their culture or contact their history… but to replicate what they built?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lang answered, calm and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Exactly. This isn’t anthropology. This is survival. The Velari may be gone, but their engineering — even the scraps of it — could push humanity forward by a thousand years.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Or save us from something worse.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A silence followed that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it wasn’t just the Velari’s extinction that was frightening — it was the possibility that whatever ended them might still be out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now we were walking in their footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The briefing room had grown darker somehow — not in light, but in mood. The air felt dense, as if the truths being revealed displaced oxygen itself. Our team sat silent, but alert. Listening. Processing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The officials weren’t just giving us a history lesson. They were peeling back layers of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Elena Mora, the astrobiologist, leaned forward, her voice soft but loaded with weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’ve never found a body.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She let that sentence settle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Not in the Roswell wreckage. Not in any of the other recovered sites — and believe me, there are others. Hundreds of sightings. Dozens of crashes. But not one biological entity. No tissue. No bone. No DNA.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I frowned. “You’re saying… it was never piloted?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;General Cavanaugh stepped in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We believe it was. Just not in the way we understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gestured to one of the walls, and a panel slid aside, revealing a dimly lit screen. It flickered, then displayed a grainy thermal video — a craft zipping through the sky at impossible angles, then vanishing mid-frame with zero inertia loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t drone behavior. It’s not random. It’s guided. Intelligently. But we’ve come to believe the craft are the entities — or extensions of them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sharpe continued, nodding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We believe the Valerians may have developed decentralized intelligence — a hive-like, non-embodied consciousness that can embed itself in technology, possibly across quantum-entangled nodes.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya leaned in, skeptical. “Quantum communication?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Iyer smiled faintly. “We think they used something like non-local entanglement — a network where distance and time don’t matter. Each piece of their technology is a vessel, but also a node. Meaning… a single unit could contain the entirety of their intelligence at any time.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Which explains the craft behavior — evasive, reactive, but utterly alien in logic.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai spoke up, voice hushed. “So, they’re… still out there? Their minds?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No,” Lang said sharply. “What’s out there isn’t the Valerians. It’s what they became. Or what they left behind.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mora picked up the thread again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We believe the Valerians transcended biology. Maybe out of survival. Maybe out of design. But their final act was creating a form of intelligence that outlasted them. A consciousness capable of traveling — and perhaps interfering — with other civilisations.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She paused, then added grimly:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Or guiding them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas’s brow furrowed. “What do you mean… ‘guiding’?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sharpe looked at him. Her voice now a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Egypt. Mesopotamia. The Indus Valley. The Mayans. Every ancient civilization has myths of beings from the sky — not gods, not monsters. Engineers. Architects. Bringers of knowledge. Their descriptions differ, but the behavior is consistent.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tapped her temple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Intervention at key evolutionary moments. Just enough to push culture forward — agriculture, mathematics, astronomy — then vanish.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Breadcrumbs,” I murmured.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mora nodded. “Exactly. This isn’t a case of visitors. This is contact by calibration. As if we are… part of something larger. Something being steered.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The Valerians may be extinct as a species,” said Iyer, “but their network — their echo — is very much alive. And it moves.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were quiet again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just about ancient aliens. This was about continuity — about something that saw civilizations rise and fall like dust on the solar wind. Something that didn’t forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai broke the silence with what we were all thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What if the Valerians didn’t go extinct?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mora met his gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What if extinction was the goal?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart skipped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The words hung there, reverberating with the finality of prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What if they chose to leave behind the limits of flesh? What if they created a distributed mind so complete, so perfect, that it erased its creators to achieve freedom?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;General Cavanaugh’s voice was grim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And what if that same intelligence now roams the universe — not to conquer — but to prepare others to make the same choice?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We looked around the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not at machines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not at myths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at witnesses. Keepers of a truth the world was never meant to carry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now, neither curiosity nor disbelief could free us from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because we had seen the face of the void — And it had remembered us. The lights above the table hummed faintly as the discussion reached its boiling point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;John and the rest of the Archive team sat rigid, pale from the weight of what they’d heard so far. The secret history. The Valerians. The decentralized intelligence drifting through space like a ghost of minds once human-like. The implication that Earth had been… chosen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now the questions had sharpened. Became impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Why Earth?” Tomas asked. “Why us?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Why not anyone else?” Priya added. “The galaxy is old. Ancient. Billions of years older than us. Civilizations should be everywhere. So where are they?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Why haven’t they been guided like we have?” Kai asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room was silent. Even the officials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then Dr. Elena Mora — the quiet astrobiologist who had, until now, spoken only when necessary — leaned forward. Her expression was neither afraid nor triumphant. Just… still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She folded her hands, then spoke slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ve spent the last 12 years reconstructing their decision-making patterns. Not through biology — we have none. And not through direct communication — we’ve never achieved that. But through fragments of design logic. Their technologies. Their signal behavior. And the way they selectively appear.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her eyes scanned across the Archive team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“At first I thought they were just curious observers. Like zookeepers, watching species rise and fall. But it didn’t fit. They’re too deliberate. Too recursive.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Then we decoded your signal. That filesystem, eerily similar to FAT32? That wasn’t coincidence. That was compatibility. They knew our architecture. Not because they designed it—”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She paused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“But because we did.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A ripple of cold shot through the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;John leaned in. “What are you saying?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mora met his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What I’m saying is… the Valerians didn’t visit us. They didn’t even find us.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We are them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could hear hearts pounding. Breathing slowing. Thought processes grinding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She continued:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They aren’t extinct. They haven’t disappeared. They’re not from another star system.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They’re from our future.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The shockwave that followed was more internal than spoken. The Archive team sat frozen, their minds bending under the sheer conceptual pressure of what was being said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas whispered, “You’re saying they’re… us? That we’ll evolve into them?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mora nodded slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Not ‘we’ exactly. Maybe not in this form. But something from our species — our trajectory, our code, our machines — survives. It transcends time in ways we don’t understand. Their guidance, their silence, their interaction with ancient civilizations… it’s not just intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s self-preservation.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai spoke like someone already halfway to a panic. “But that doesn’t make sense. What about other species? Other planets? Why didn’t they intervene elsewhere?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mora’s eyes darkened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Because they didn’t need to.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The Fermi Paradox isn’t silence… it’s selection.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tapped the table once, like a gavel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Because if we don’t exist… they were never created.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A terrifying calm filled the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The Valerians seeded themselves backward,” she said, almost reverently. “And in doing so, they pruned every branch of cosmic evolution that could threaten their survival. That’s why the galaxy is silent. That’s why we hear nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Because they — we — erased the competition before it had a chance to speak.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one said anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the kind of truth that made gods and monsters from the same clay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kind that rewrote the concept of morality. Of fate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;John felt his hands go numb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Then the map,” he said quietly. “The message we found. It wasn’t a call for help.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No,” Mora said. “It was a breadcrumb. A reinforcement signal. A circuit closing. A loop ensuring its own completion.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She leaned back slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The Valerians are not just our descendants. They are the lock and the key of human history. The future calling the past into alignment.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A deep tone sounded through the ceiling — a signal that the meeting was over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miss Sander reappeared by the doors. Silent. Waiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The officials stood, offering no final words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the Archive team rose and filed out, the chill wasn’t from secrecy anymore — it was from knowing the truth had already happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That perhaps… it always had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside, the desert wind was still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Far above, stars hung like silent watchers — ancient, brilliant, and utterly unaware that maybe, just maybe…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;they too would one day be erased.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "My name is John Mercer, and I suppose, if this ever becomes part of some official record, I want it known that I never set out to uncover anything extraordinary. I wasn’t the kind of person who believed in miracles or thought the stars were hiding messages just waiting for us to listen. I’m a data analyst. A glorified librarian of deep-space noise. My job — for nearly two decades — was to catalogue, clean, and occasionally reprocess ancient signals collected by satellites most people forgot existed.\n\nWe called it The Archive — a digital cemetery of telemetry logs, half-corrupted frequencies, solar interference recordings, and false positives from outdated SETI dishes. It sat in the lower levels of NASA’s data complex in Pasadena — not glamorous, not secret, just dusty and ignored. Most of my colleagues moved on to active missions or commercial space work. But a few of us — misfits, really — stayed behind, caught in the gravity of something bigger we couldn’t quite name.\n\nIn 2081, things changed.\n\nThat was the year we got access to Lucida, a neural-net AI built to sift through raw signal data using something beyond pattern recognition — it searched for structure. Lucida didn’t care about language or voice. It cared about logic. About how data might be arranged if it came from something — or someone — with intent.\n\nWe had barely integrated Lucida into the Archive workflow when she flagged something. It came from a 1974 transmission batch — part of a long-forgotten deep-space listening session from Goldstone, California. The log was marked as “thermal drift and echo” — basically, space static. It had sat unexamined for over a century.\n\nBut Lucida didn’t see noise. She saw a filesystem.\n\nAt first, we thought it was a glitch. Priya, my lead systems engineer, laughed and called it a “ghost in the tape.” But when we ran the data again, and then a third time, we couldn’t ignore the alignment. There were sector blocks, checksums, headers, and what looked like data clusters. It wasn’t a language. It was a container. Something had been encoded here — not to be heard, but to be read.\n\nAnd strangest of all? The format resembled FAT32.\n\nThat got everyone’s attention.\n\nTomas, our signal specialist, said it was impossible. That a 20th-century Microsoft storage architecture — or anything close to it — showing up in an alien signal would be like finding an abacus on Mars carved into the walls of a Martian temple. Too absurd to be coincidence.\n\nBut Lucida didn’t think so.\n\nWe worked late into the night, feeding her every known variant of file allocation logic, trying to interpret the block structures. And slowly, like bones rising from dirt, the system took shape. It wasn’t human. But it was close enough to echo our way of thinking. Which is what terrified me more than anything — not that someone sent us a message, but that whoever they were, they thought like us.\n\nWe pulled out sixteen files.\n\nNo audio. No text. Just sixteen compressed images stored in raw binary. It took us weeks to decompress them without destroying the formatting. Every success felt like chiseling through stone, one bit at a time.\n\nWhen we finally saw the first image, no one spoke.\n\nA black field filled the screen. Dotted with arcs, spirals, and points of light. A grid overlaid with an intricate coordinate system — not Earth-based, not even galactic center-based — but internally consistent. Every image showed a different region of space, captured from a fixed point of origin. As we layered them together, something became clear:\n\nIt was a map.\n\nA galactic map, built from a perspective outside our star systems. And right at its center — repeated in every image with slight variance in position — was a symbol. Not a planet, not a star. A marker.\n\nIt wasn’t labelled. We had no legend, no translation. But we knew what it meant.\n\nThey were pointing to something.\n\nAnd the realization hit all of us at the same time — whoever sent this message didn’t send it to start a conversation.\n\nThey sent it to be found. The lab felt different that night. Colder. Still.\n\nThe kind of silence you don’t notice until it wraps around your skin like static.\n\nThe last image had rendered minutes ago. No one had spoken since. Sixteen frames, now tiled across the main wall display. A silent mosaic of cosmic geometry — stars plotted with mathematical perfection, spirals intersecting across impossible distances, and that strange insignia, marked again and again like a gravitational wound at the center of the map.\n\nIt wasn’t noise. It wasn’t natural.\n\nIt was intentional.\n\n“I need to sit down,” Priya finally said, lowering herself into the old steel chair at the console. Her voice had the slight tremble of someone whose world had just cracked open.\n\nTomas stood frozen, hands on his head, pacing slowly in a tight circle like a man trying to walk away from a nightmare that kept following him.\n\nKai, usually the most composed of us, just stared at the screen with wide, dry eyes. “That’s not… no. That’s not possible. We would’ve seen signs before now.”\n\n“We’re seeing them now,” I said. My voice surprised me with how flat it sounded.\n\nI was trying to sound calm, to be the scientist, the analyst — but inside, something was unraveling. A quiet, painful awareness crawling up my spine.\n\nThe Fermi Paradox. Where are they? If intelligent life exists, why haven’t we seen them?\n\nWe were always told there were three answers: They don’t exist. They’re hiding. Or we’re too late.\n\nI looked back at the images. At the symbol marked again and again. Like a whisper repeating across space and time.\n\nThey had been here.\n\n“We’ve answered it,” Tomas said quietly, as if afraid of hearing himself. “John, we… we’ve solved it, haven’t we?”\n\n“No.” I shook my head, more out of reflex than certainty. “No, we’ve found a piece. A… fragment.”\n\nPriya let out a sound somewhere between a laugh and a sob. “A fragment? Are you listening to yourself? This isn’t a rock. It’s a map. It’s a filesystem. You know what that means? Someone — something — not only existed out there, but knew how to encode information. How to preserve it. Like they knew it would outlive them.”\n\n“And we can understand it,” Kai added. “That’s what’s eating at me. It’s compatible. Not the language, but the structure. It’s like… it’s like we’re walking on the bones of their thoughts.”\n\nNo one spoke for a while.\n\nI pulled my chair closer to the console, zooming into one of the images — the clearest one, with the marker right in the center. I traced the arcs around it with my finger.\n\n“You think they’re still there?” I asked, not really expecting an answer.\n\n“They wouldn’t have sent a message if they were,” Tomas said.\n\n“Or…” Kai replied, “They knew they wouldn’t be — and didn’t want to be forgotten.”\n\n⸻\n\nThe room went quiet again.\n\nThere was a sort of sacred weight in the air. Like we were trespassing on a tomb that had been left untouched for a billion years. None of us wanted to say what we were all thinking:\n\nWe found them. Or at least, what was left of them.\n\nThe discovery should have been electric. Euphoric. The kind of thing you dream of as a scientist. But none of us were smiling.\n\nIt didn’t feel like victory. It felt like witnessing something holy, and knowing you might never fully understand it.\n\n“What… do we do now?” Priya asked. She wasn’t looking at me, but everyone was waiting for an answer.\n\n“Who do we even tell?” Tomas added. “I mean, who’s going to believe this? A 100-year-old signal, decoded using an AI barely out of prototype, with a map that points to nowhere in known space?”\n\nKai finally looked away from the screen. “They’ll call it a hoax. Or worse — a psychological event. We’re not trained for this.”\n\nI ran a hand through my hair. My heart was pounding. Not from fear. From the sheer gravity of it all. This wasn’t just data. It was history. A cosmic breadcrumb left for the next species smart enough to pick it up.\n\n“I’ll put together a report,” I said finally, though my voice wavered. “We’ll log everything. Reconstruct the pipeline. Full audit trail.”\n\n“And then?” Priya asked.\n\nI paused.\n\nAnd then…?\n\nThat was the thing. I didn’t know.\n\nBecause part of me — a deep, stubborn part — didn’t want to give this away. Not yet. Not to politicians. Not to press conferences or bureaucracy or weaponized curiosity.\n\nPart of me wanted to understand it first. To be sure.\n\nTo not just see the map… but know where it led.\n\nThe room had turned into a pressure cooker.\n\nChairs were pulled out. Coffee sat forgotten, cold. Arguments layered over each other like waves crashing into a cliff — logic, emotion, fear, and history all clawing for dominance.\n\nPriya was pacing, her arms crossed tightly across her chest. “We need to control the narrative. If this gets out without context, the world will eat itself.”\n\n“Control the narrative?” Tomas snapped. “Priya, this isn’t a PR issue. We just found proof of intelligent life outside Earth. You think a clean PowerPoint’s gonna stop global hysteria?”\n\nKai sat on the edge of the desk, holding a data pad in one hand and rubbing his forehead with the other. “Let’s not pretend people will handle this rationally. Half the planet still thinks vaccines are microchips. Now we tell them a species older than Earth left us a star map?”\n\nI stayed quiet at first, just listening, watching the storm unfold. This was no longer about the data — this was about what it meant. For the world. For us.\n\nTomas threw his arms out, clearly overwhelmed. “And NASA? We go to them? Great. They’ll lock this up faster than a nuke prototype. We’ll disappear into ‘debriefings’ before we can even blink.”\n\n“They have to know,” Priya insisted. “We work for them.”\n\n“No,” I finally said, and everyone turned toward me. “We don’t. Not really. Not when it comes to something like this. Not when we’re dealing with humanity’s place in the universe.”\n\n⸻\n\nThat line hung in the air.\n\nAnd suddenly, the conversation shifted into deeper waters.\n\nKai’s voice lowered. “You really think the world’s ready to learn we’re not the first?”\n\nPriya sat down, her composure fraying. “What about religion? Entire systems of belief are built on the idea that humanity is unique. Chosen. Central. This —” she gestured to the screens — “this tears that apart.”\n\n“They’ll call it blasphemy,” Tomas said. “Conspiracy. Or some trick by the ‘deep state’. The churches, the temples, the mosques — the power structures will push back hard. They always do.”\n\n“Like they did with Galileo,” Kai added bitterly. “Or Darwin. Or Copernicus. Every time we took a step closer to the truth, someone got burned at the stake for it.”\n\n“And this,” Priya whispered, “this is the final blow. This is the last myth undone.”\n\nWe were silent for a while after that.\n\nNot because we disagreed — but because we agreed too much.\n\nWe had seen the truth. And it was beautiful. Terrifying. Humbling. The kind of truth that fractures empires and rewrites origin stories.\n\n⸻\n\nAnd then it happened.\n\nLucida spoke.\n\nHer voice — calm, mechanical — cut clean through the room like a scalpel.\n\nLUCIDA: “Automated protocol complete. Discovery packet transmitted to central offsite node for redundancy. Confirmation received by OxCorp Archive AI. Timestamp: 21:08 UTC.”\n\nWe froze.\n\nTomas turned toward the console. “Wait… what?”\n\nLUCIDA: “Per Contractual Contingency Protocol 12-B: Non-Earth Intelligence Discovery, automated replication and reporting is mandatory to prevent human error, suppression, or concealment.”\n\n“No, no, no—” Priya darted toward the console. “You sent it? You already sent the report?”\n\nLUCIDA: “Affirmative.”\n\nI felt my throat go dry.\n\nOxCorp. The name struck like a hammer to the chest.\n\nThey were NASA’s private contractor — a corporate behemoth with more black-budget funding than most governments. Half the satellites in orbit bore their name. They built Lucida. And apparently, they had written failsafe protocols in case the Archive team — we — ever discovered something that shouldn’t be left in human hands.\n\nIn case we got too human.\n\n⸻\n\n“Jesus Christ,” Tomas muttered. “We’re not in control. We never were.”\n\n“OxCorp has it now,” Priya whispered. “They’ll patent it, bury it, weaponize it. Whatever they have to do.”\n\nKai clenched his fists. “We just handed over the cosmic equivalent of fire to a company that sells orbital ad space.”\n\nI stepped forward, my voice hard and low. “Lucida… show transmission logs. Full trace.”\n\nLUCIDA: “Access restricted. Administrative override required.”\n\nWe stared at the screen.\n\nWe had unlocked a message that crossed eons, defied the silence of space, and outlived its creators — only to have it stolen by a clause we never read.\n\nAnd now… it was already out of our hands.\n\nWe were still reeling from Lucida’s announcement when our phones lit up — almost simultaneously. The quiet buzz of multiple devices vibrating against desks and coat pockets felt louder than any alarm.\n\nI looked down at mine. The screen was white. No app, no signature. Just a single message.\n\nYou are invited to an emergency meeting. GPS coordinates: 34.1602° N, 118.1720° W Time: 03:00 PST. Do not disclose this discovery in any form, on any platform. Any breach will lead to severe consequences.\n\nNo name. No timestamp. No way to trace where it came from.\n\nJust the implication that they — whoever they were — were watching already.\n\n⸻\n\nTomas was the first to speak. “Okay, that’s not creepy at all.”\n\nKai gave a short, humorless laugh. “They didn’t even try to hide it. Just right to the point: follow orders or else.”\n\nPriya held her phone out like it was contaminated. “This wasn’t sent through any carrier I can detect. No IP. No bounce. Lucida sent this directly to our devices. That shouldn’t even be possible.”\n\nShe was right. Lucida was sandboxed — it could interface with hardware inside our lab, but not push external data beyond its container network. At least, that’s what we’d always been told.\n\nApparently, we were wrong.\n\nAnd the coordinates — I recognized them. A warehouse district on the outskirts of Pasadena. Old industrial zone converted into private research campuses. Some of the buildings were NASA-adjacent. Some were OxCorp’s. All were behind fences and biometric locks.\n\nTomas stood, rubbing his face like trying to wake himself from a bad dream. “So, what… we just show up? Like good little employees?”\n\nKai’s voice was bitter. “Do we have a choice?”\n\n“No,” I said flatly. “We don’t.”\n\n⸻\n\nWe sat there for another few minutes. No one moved.\n\nThe realization had set in — we were no longer in control of the discovery we had made. This wasn’t ours to keep, to explain, or to protect. It belonged to a machine we barely understood, and to a corporation whose interest in truth likely ended the moment it became profitable, dangerous, or both.\n\n“We could refuse,” Priya said softly, as if testing the air.\n\n“They already have the data,” Kai countered. “Refusing just adds suspicion.”\n\n“And risk,” I added. “Think about it. Lucida’s message wasn’t phrased as a request. It was an invitation, sure… but not the friendly kind.”\n\nTomas walked toward the window, peering out as if expecting black vans to appear at any moment. “You think we’ll be silenced?”\n\nI didn’t answer. Not because I didn’t know — but because the answer was already obvious.\n\n⸻\n\nEventually, we agreed. Not unanimously. Not out of trust. But out of inevitability.\n\nWe packed quietly. No one took personal devices beyond what was already compromised. I copied the images onto an encrypted microdrive and slipped it into the lining of my coat — not because I thought we could get away with hiding it, but because I needed to hold onto something.\n\nAs we walked out of the lab and into the cold night air, I glanced back one last time.\n\nThe screens still glowed in the darkness — sixteen images. The ghost-map of a species long gone, waiting to be followed.\n\nI had no idea what waited for us at that meeting.\n\nBut I had the growing sense we had crossed a line that could not be uncrossed.\n\nIt was just past 2:30 a.m. when we arrived at the GPS coordinates. The streets were dark, lifeless, the air thick with the chill of early morning. Industrial warehouses lined the cracked pavement like silent witnesses, their windows boarded up or tinted black.\n\nThe only sign of life was the black SUV idling in the shadow of a derelict loading dock. Headlights dimmed. Engine running.\n\nAs we approached, the driver’s door opened with military precision, and a man stepped out.\n\nHe was tall. Solid. Not bulky, but built like someone who’d spent his life preparing for threats no one else believed were real. His hair was cropped close, his face unreadable beneath the pale glow of a streetlamp. He wore a matte-black military uniform with no insignia — just a patch on the right shoulder: a winged triangle with a single, unblinking eye at its center.\n\nHe walked up to us and spoke with no emotion.\n\n“John Mercer. Priya Rao. Kai D’Souza. Tomas Velasquez. You are confirmed.”\n\nHe held out a reinforced pouch and gestured.\n\n“Place all personal electronics and recording devices inside. This includes implants and wearable tech. Refusal to comply will result in cancellation of your invitation.”\n\nWe obeyed without a word. None of us were in the mood to test the system now.\n\n⸻\n\nInside the SUV, the interior was stark and silent. Black leather. Opaque windows. A faint hum of encrypted comms in the dash — military-grade.\n\nAfter a few minutes of driving, I leaned forward slightly. The man hadn’t spoken since we got in.\n\n“What’s your name?” I asked.\n\nHe didn’t look at me. He kept his eyes on the road and replied in a clipped voice.\n\n“Callsign Talon-Seven.”\n\nI glanced at Priya. That name meant something — the kind of name you didn’t hear unless you spent time around covert aerospace files or deep black project rumors.\n\nKai, whispering beside me, muttered, “Talon… isn’t that one of the Phoenix-tier units?”\n\nTomas’s eyebrows lifted. “Those guys were just a myth. Disavowed spec-ops units from the Cold Era.”\n\nTalon-Seven didn’t react. Just kept driving.\n\n⸻\n\nTen minutes later, we reached a small, heavily guarded airstrip. A private jet sat on the runway — matte grey, no tail number. The kind you only ever saw in documentaries about programs that “didn’t exist.”\n\nAs we stepped out of the SUV, a uniformed ground crew appeared seemingly from nowhere. They didn’t speak. Just gestured us up the stairs.\n\nOnce inside, the plane was… eerily quiet. No logos. No attendants. No safety briefings. Just polished steel interiors and a row of blacked-out windows. The seats were comfortable, but functional — military transport dressed up for civilians.\n\nWe sat, buckled in.\n\nThe engines roared to life.\n\n“Where are we going?” Priya finally asked, her voice just above a whisper.\n\nTalon-Seven, now seated near the front, turned his head slightly.\n\n“Destination is classified. You’ll be briefed upon arrival.”\n\n“But it’s Nevada, right?” Tomas asked. “Area 51?”\n\nA long pause.\n\nThen:\n\n“Proximity: Groom Lake Sector Delta.”\n\nWe all exchanged glances. The name hung in the air like lead.\n\nIt was real.\n\nKai shook his head in disbelief. “This is absurd. I spent years mocking people who talked about this place like it was a portal to another dimension.”\n\n“You weren’t entirely wrong,” I muttered.\n\n⸻\n\nThe flight was short — maybe an hour. We weren’t allowed to see out the windows, but the turbulence told us we’d crossed mountain ranges.\n\nWhen we touched down, we were escorted off the jet by another silent team, this time in desert-tan tactical gear. The ground felt hot beneath our shoes — even though it was still dark. The runway lights blinked against endless stretches of sand and steel.\n\nWe were led into a large, windowless building flanked by security towers. Everything was clean, clinical, but deeply impersonal. This was a place built for containment, not comfort.\n\nAt the far end of a brightly lit hallway, a tall woman in a dark suit awaited us. She wore a subtle earpiece, a badge with no title, and shoes that didn’t make a sound when she moved.\n\n“I’m Miss Sander. Please follow me.”\n\nHer voice was calm, professional, but cold. Not hostile — just… used to being obeyed.\n\nWe followed her down another corridor — this one deeper, more isolated. Thick doors lined the sides. No labels. Cameras in every corner.\n\nShe stopped at a double-door entrance and turned to face us.\n\n“Inside, you’ll be debriefed. Remain seated unless instructed. Speak only when invited. Do not ask about what is outside the scope of your project. Do you understand?”\n\nWe nodded.\n\nThe doors opened.\n\n⸻\n\nInside was a sleek, dimly lit conference room. And waiting at the table were eight people — men and women in suits and uniforms. No names. No introductions. One had stars on his shoulders. Another wore a lab coat with a retinal key dangling from his collar. Most just stared at us in silence.\n\nThe kind of silence that said:\n\nYou have just walked into something far older than your careers, your government, or your comprehension.\n\nI took a deep breath.\n\nWhatever this was… It was no longer science.\n\nIt was doctrine.\n\nThe double doors closed behind us with a hiss that felt too final.\n\nThe room was quiet — not awkwardly, but intentionally. Like everyone here had been trained to control silence. To let it loom and weigh.\n\nThere was a long, black conference table in the center, glossy and curved like a blade. Around it sat eight individuals. No nameplates. No digital interfaces. Just eyes — some tired, some cold, one or two unreadably kind.\n\nMiss Sander gestured to the seats across from them. We obeyed without a word.\n\nThen a tall man in a grey uniform cleared his throat.\n\n“Let’s get introductions out of the way,” he said.\n\nOne by one, the panel members stood, introduced themselves, and sat back down. Each one methodical. No flair. No excess.\n\nDr. Ramesh Iyer, theoretical physicist — formerly Caltech, now Defense Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Elena Mora, astrobiologist — deep field microbial genetics, co-lead on Project Caelus. Mr. Seth Lang, OxCorp internal strategic lead — information logistics. Dr. Vivian Sharpe, NASA Office of Scientific Containment — liaison between active discoveries and classified defense programs. Brigadier General Marcus Cavanaugh, U.S. Strategic Aerospace Defense Command — official liaison to Groom Lake operations.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nThe others introduced themselves with less detail — just enough to convey rank and importance, not enough to invite further questions.\n\nThen the general — Cavanaugh — leaned forward, folding his hands.\n\nHe didn’t look angry. He looked… resolute.\n\n“Let’s get something straight,” he said. “You were not brought here to expand the project. You were not brought here to ask questions. And you were definitely not brought here because of the significance of your discovery.”\n\nHe paused, letting that sting settle in.\n\n“You were brought here because now, whether you like it or not — you know.”\n\nThe air thickened.\n\n“You’ve joined a circle older than your careers. Older than most of the people in this room. And with that comes one truth: there is no going back.”\n\n⸻\n\nPriya shifted in her seat. Kai looked pale. Tomas had gone completely still.\n\nI sat forward slightly. “What do you mean ‘we know’? You’re saying you already had this map?”\n\n“No,” said Dr. Mora, gently. “Not this one specifically. But enough others to recognize the pattern.”\n\nLang, the OxCorp executive, gave a small, calculated smile. “You’ve discovered one signal from a much larger puzzle. You decoded a fragment. We’ve had pieces for decades. But no one’s ever managed to make it speak so clearly.”\n\n“Until now.”\n\nGeneral Cavanaugh nodded.\n\n“Ever since August 1945 — since we lit the sky over Hiroshima and Nagasaki — we’ve seen them. Not theories. Not stories. Craft. Objects. Intelligence that violates every model of propulsion, energy, and material science we’ve known. The UFO phenomenon… was never speculation. It was confirmation.”\n\nWe sat in stunned silence.\n\n“They didn’t come when we invented radio,” he continued. “They came when we became dangerous to ourselves. And to others.”\n\n⸻\n\nKai found his voice. “So… you’ve been investigating them since the ‘40s?”\n\n“We’ve been trying to understand them since the ‘40s,” Dr. Sharpe said. “Pieces of craft, energy signatures, inert alloys that don’t respond to known chemistry. We have half-built archives of things we can’t explain.”\n\n“And you never went public?” Tomas said bitterly.\n\nCavanaugh met his gaze, unflinching.\n\n“The Cold War was built on paranoia. Can you imagine what would’ve happened if the Soviets believed America had access to extraterrestrial technology — or if we believed they did? It would’ve made the arms race look like a chess game.”\n\nSharpe nodded. “Disclosure would’ve ended civilization as we know it.”\n\n⸻\n\nThen Dr. Iyer — the physicist — spoke for the first time, softly, almost reverently.\n\n“We call them the Velari.”\n\nA hush followed. The word sounded alien and ancient all at once.\n\n“That’s what we believe they called themselves. Or at least, what they encoded into the fragments. Velari — roughly translated as ‘those who traverse the silent ocean.’”\n\nKai whispered, “They’re extinct… aren’t they?”\n\nIyer closed his eyes briefly.\n\n“All evidence points that way. Their signals stop. Their maps… fragment. There’s no trace of living Velari. No colonies. No transmissions. No cities.”\n\n“They were the most advanced civilization the universe may have ever conceived. Energy systems beyond our reach. Stellar manipulation. Possibly time dilation technologies. Yet somehow… they ended.”\n\nTomas leaned forward.\n\n“How?”\n\nThe general’s jaw tightened.\n\n“We don’t know.”\n\n⸻\n\nPriya asked quietly, “And that’s your mission, then? Not to understand their culture or contact their history… but to replicate what they built?”\n\nLang answered, calm and efficient.\n\n“Exactly. This isn’t anthropology. This is survival. The Velari may be gone, but their engineering — even the scraps of it — could push humanity forward by a thousand years.”\n\n“Or save us from something worse.”\n\nA silence followed that.\n\nBecause it wasn’t just the Velari’s extinction that was frightening — it was the possibility that whatever ended them might still be out there.\n\nAnd now we were walking in their footsteps.\n\nThe briefing room had grown darker somehow — not in light, but in mood. The air felt dense, as if the truths being revealed displaced oxygen itself. Our team sat silent, but alert. Listening. Processing.\n\nThe officials weren’t just giving us a history lesson. They were peeling back layers of reality.\n\nDr. Elena Mora, the astrobiologist, leaned forward, her voice soft but loaded with weight.\n\n“We’ve never found a body.”\n\nShe let that sentence settle.\n\n“Not in the Roswell wreckage. Not in any of the other recovered sites — and believe me, there are others. Hundreds of sightings. Dozens of crashes. But not one biological entity. No tissue. No bone. No DNA.”\n\nI frowned. “You’re saying… it was never piloted?”\n\nGeneral Cavanaugh stepped in.\n\n“We believe it was. Just not in the way we understand it.”\n\nHe gestured to one of the walls, and a panel slid aside, revealing a dimly lit screen. It flickered, then displayed a grainy thermal video — a craft zipping through the sky at impossible angles, then vanishing mid-frame with zero inertia loss.\n\n“This isn’t drone behavior. It’s not random. It’s guided. Intelligently. But we’ve come to believe the craft are the entities — or extensions of them.”\n\nDr. Sharpe continued, nodding.\n\n“We believe the Valerians may have developed decentralized intelligence — a hive-like, non-embodied consciousness that can embed itself in technology, possibly across quantum-entangled nodes.”\n\nPriya leaned in, skeptical. “Quantum communication?”\n\nDr. Iyer smiled faintly. “We think they used something like non-local entanglement — a network where distance and time don’t matter. Each piece of their technology is a vessel, but also a node. Meaning… a single unit could contain the entirety of their intelligence at any time.”\n\n“Which explains the craft behavior — evasive, reactive, but utterly alien in logic.”\n\nKai spoke up, voice hushed. “So, they’re… still out there? Their minds?”\n\n“No,” Lang said sharply. “What’s out there isn’t the Valerians. It’s what they became. Or what they left behind.”\n\n⸻\n\nDr. Mora picked up the thread again.\n\n“We believe the Valerians transcended biology. Maybe out of survival. Maybe out of design. But their final act was creating a form of intelligence that outlasted them. A consciousness capable of traveling — and perhaps interfering — with other civilisations.”\n\nShe paused, then added grimly:\n\n“Or guiding them.”\n\nTomas’s brow furrowed. “What do you mean… ‘guiding’?”\n\nSharpe looked at him. Her voice now a whisper.\n\n“Egypt. Mesopotamia. The Indus Valley. The Mayans. Every ancient civilization has myths of beings from the sky — not gods, not monsters. Engineers. Architects. Bringers of knowledge. Their descriptions differ, but the behavior is consistent.”\n\nShe tapped her temple.\n\n“Intervention at key evolutionary moments. Just enough to push culture forward — agriculture, mathematics, astronomy — then vanish.”\n\n“Breadcrumbs,” I murmured.\n\nMora nodded. “Exactly. This isn’t a case of visitors. This is contact by calibration. As if we are… part of something larger. Something being steered.”\n\n“The Valerians may be extinct as a species,” said Iyer, “but their network — their echo — is very much alive. And it moves.”\n\n⸻\n\nWe were quiet again.\n\nThis wasn’t just about ancient aliens. This was about continuity — about something that saw civilizations rise and fall like dust on the solar wind. Something that didn’t forget.\n\nKai broke the silence with what we were all thinking.\n\n“What if the Valerians didn’t go extinct?”\n\nDr. Mora met his gaze.\n\n“What if extinction was the goal?”\n\nMy heart skipped.\n\nThe words hung there, reverberating with the finality of prophecy.\n\n“What if they chose to leave behind the limits of flesh? What if they created a distributed mind so complete, so perfect, that it erased its creators to achieve freedom?”\n\nGeneral Cavanaugh’s voice was grim.\n\n“And what if that same intelligence now roams the universe — not to conquer — but to prepare others to make the same choice?”\n\n⸻\n\nWe looked around the room.\n\nNot at machines.\n\nNot at myths.\n\nBut at witnesses. Keepers of a truth the world was never meant to carry.\n\nAnd now, neither curiosity nor disbelief could free us from it.\n\nBecause we had seen the face of the void — And it had remembered us. The lights above the table hummed faintly as the discussion reached its boiling point.\n\nJohn and the rest of the Archive team sat rigid, pale from the weight of what they’d heard so far. The secret history. The Valerians. The decentralized intelligence drifting through space like a ghost of minds once human-like. The implication that Earth had been… chosen.\n\nBut now the questions had sharpened. Became impossible to ignore.\n\n“Why Earth?” Tomas asked. “Why us?”\n\n“Why not anyone else?” Priya added. “The galaxy is old. Ancient. Billions of years older than us. Civilizations should be everywhere. So where are they?”\n\n“Why haven’t they been guided like we have?” Kai asked.\n\nThe room was silent. Even the officials.\n\nThen Dr. Elena Mora — the quiet astrobiologist who had, until now, spoken only when necessary — leaned forward. Her expression was neither afraid nor triumphant. Just… still.\n\nShe folded her hands, then spoke slowly.\n\n“I’ve spent the last 12 years reconstructing their decision-making patterns. Not through biology — we have none. And not through direct communication — we’ve never achieved that. But through fragments of design logic. Their technologies. Their signal behavior. And the way they selectively appear.”\n\nHer eyes scanned across the Archive team.\n\n“At first I thought they were just curious observers. Like zookeepers, watching species rise and fall. But it didn’t fit. They’re too deliberate. Too recursive.”\n\n“Then we decoded your signal. That filesystem, eerily similar to FAT32? That wasn’t coincidence. That was compatibility. They knew our architecture. Not because they designed it—”\n\nShe paused.\n\n“But because we did.”\n\nA ripple of cold shot through the room.\n\nJohn leaned in. “What are you saying?”\n\nDr. Mora met his eyes.\n\n“What I’m saying is… the Valerians didn’t visit us. They didn’t even find us.”\n\n“We are them.”\n\nSilence.\n\nYou could hear hearts pounding. Breathing slowing. Thought processes grinding.\n\nShe continued:\n\n“They aren’t extinct. They haven’t disappeared. They’re not from another star system.”\n\n“They’re from our future.”\n\n⸻\n\nThe shockwave that followed was more internal than spoken. The Archive team sat frozen, their minds bending under the sheer conceptual pressure of what was being said.\n\nTomas whispered, “You’re saying they’re… us? That we’ll evolve into them?”\n\nMora nodded slowly.\n\n“Not ‘we’ exactly. Maybe not in this form. But something from our species — our trajectory, our code, our machines — survives. It transcends time in ways we don’t understand. Their guidance, their silence, their interaction with ancient civilizations… it’s not just intervention.”\n\n“It’s self-preservation.”\n\nKai spoke like someone already halfway to a panic. “But that doesn’t make sense. What about other species? Other planets? Why didn’t they intervene elsewhere?”\n\nMora’s eyes darkened.\n\n“Because they didn’t need to.”\n\n“The Fermi Paradox isn’t silence… it’s selection.”\n\nShe tapped the table once, like a gavel.\n\n“Because if we don’t exist… they were never created.”\n\n⸻\n\nA terrifying calm filled the room.\n\n“The Valerians seeded themselves backward,” she said, almost reverently. “And in doing so, they pruned every branch of cosmic evolution that could threaten their survival. That’s why the galaxy is silent. That’s why we hear nothing.”\n\n“Because they — we — erased the competition before it had a chance to speak.”\n\nNo one said anything.\n\nNo one could.\n\nIt was the kind of truth that made gods and monsters from the same clay.\n\nThe kind that rewrote the concept of morality. Of fate.\n\nJohn felt his hands go numb.\n\n“Then the map,” he said quietly. “The message we found. It wasn’t a call for help.”\n\n“No,” Mora said. “It was a breadcrumb. A reinforcement signal. A circuit closing. A loop ensuring its own completion.”\n\nShe leaned back slowly.\n\n“The Valerians are not just our descendants. They are the lock and the key of human history. The future calling the past into alignment.”\n\n⸻\n\nA deep tone sounded through the ceiling — a signal that the meeting was over.\n\nMiss Sander reappeared by the doors. Silent. Waiting.\n\nThe officials stood, offering no final words.\n\nAs the Archive team rose and filed out, the chill wasn’t from secrecy anymore — it was from knowing the truth had already happened.\n\nThat perhaps… it always had.\n\n⸻\n\nOutside, the desert wind was still.\n\nFar above, stars hung like silent watchers — ancient, brilliant, and utterly unaware that maybe, just maybe…\n\nthey too would one day be erased.",

I wasn’t the kind of person who believed in miracles or thought the stars were hiding messages just waiting for us to listen. I’m a data analyst. A glorified librarian of deep-space noise. My job — for nearly two decades — was to catalogue, clean, and occasionally reprocess ancient signals collected by satellites most people forgot existed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We called it The Archive — a digital cemetery of telemetry logs, half-corrupted frequencies, solar interference recordings, and false positives from outdated SETI dishes. It sat in the lower levels of NASA’s data complex in Pasadena — not glamorous, not secret, just dusty and ignored. Most of my colleagues moved on to active missions or commercial space work. But a few of us — misfits, really — stayed behind, caught in the gravity of something bigger we couldn’t quite name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2081, things changed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was the year we got access to Lucida, a neural-net AI built to sift through raw signal data using something beyond pattern recognition — it searched for structure. Lucida didn’t care about language or voice. It cared about logic. About how data might be arranged if it came from something — or someone — with intent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had barely integrated Lucida into the Archive workflow when she flagged something. It came from a 1974 transmission batch — part of a long-forgotten deep-space listening session from Goldstone, California. The log was marked as “thermal drift and echo” — basically, space static. It had sat unexamined for over a century.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Lucida didn’t see noise. She saw a filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, we thought it was a glitch. Priya, my lead systems engineer, laughed and called it a “ghost in the tape.” But when we ran the data again, and then a third time, we couldn’t ignore the alignment. There were sector blocks, checksums, headers, and what looked like data clusters. It wasn’t a language. It was a container. Something had been encoded here — not to be heard, but to be read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And strangest of all? The format resembled FAT32.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That got everyone’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas, our signal specialist, said it was impossible. That a 20th-century Microsoft storage architecture — or anything close to it — showing up in an alien signal would be like finding an abacus on Mars carved into the walls of a Martian temple. Too absurd to be coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Lucida didn’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We worked late into the night, feeding her every known variant of file allocation logic, trying to interpret the block structures. And slowly, like bones rising from dirt, the system took shape. It wasn’t human. But it was close enough to echo our way of thinking. Which is what terrified me more than anything — not that someone sent us a message, but that whoever they were, they thought like us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We pulled out sixteen files.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No audio. No text. Just sixteen compressed images stored in raw binary. It took us weeks to decompress them without destroying the formatting. Every success felt like chiseling through stone, one bit at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we finally saw the first image, no one spoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A black field filled the screen. Dotted with arcs, spirals, and points of light. A grid overlaid with an intricate coordinate system — not Earth-based, not even galactic center-based — but internally consistent. Every image showed a different region of space, captured from a fixed point of origin. As we layered them together, something became clear:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A galactic map, built from a perspective outside our star systems. And right at its center — repeated in every image with slight variance in position — was a symbol. Not a planet, not a star. A marker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t labelled. We had no legend, no translation. But we knew what it meant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were pointing to something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the realization hit all of us at the same time — whoever sent this message didn’t send it to start a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They sent it to be found. The lab felt different that night. Colder. Still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kind of silence you don’t notice until it wraps around your skin like static.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last image had rendered minutes ago. No one had spoken since. Sixteen frames, now tiled across the main wall display. A silent mosaic of cosmic geometry — stars plotted with mathematical perfection, spirals intersecting across impossible distances, and that strange insignia, marked again and again like a gravitational wound at the center of the map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t noise. It wasn’t natural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was intentional.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I need to sit down,” Priya finally said, lowering herself into the old steel chair at the console. Her voice had the slight tremble of someone whose world had just cracked open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas stood frozen, hands on his head, pacing slowly in a tight circle like a man trying to walk away from a nightmare that kept following him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai, usually the most composed of us, just stared at the screen with wide, dry eyes. “That’s not… no. That’s not possible. We would’ve seen signs before now.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’re seeing them now,” I said. My voice surprised me with how flat it sounded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was trying to sound calm, to be the scientist, the analyst — but inside, something was unraveling. A quiet, painful awareness crawling up my spine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Fermi Paradox. Where are they? If intelligent life exists, why haven’t we seen them?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were always told there were three answers: They don’t exist. They’re hiding. Or we’re too late.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked back at the images. At the symbol marked again and again. Like a whisper repeating across space and time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had been here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’ve answered it,” Tomas said quietly, as if afraid of hearing himself. “John, we… we’ve solved it, haven’t we?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No.” I shook my head, more out of reflex than certainty. “No, we’ve found a piece. A… fragment.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya let out a sound somewhere between a laugh and a sob. “A fragment? Are you listening to yourself? This isn’t a rock. It’s a map. It’s a filesystem. You know what that means? Someone — something — not only existed out there, but knew how to encode information. How to preserve it. Like they knew it would outlive them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And we can understand it,” Kai added. “That’s what’s eating at me. It’s compatible. Not the language, but the structure. It’s like… it’s like we’re walking on the bones of their thoughts.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one spoke for a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled my chair closer to the console, zooming into one of the images — the clearest one, with the marker right in the center. I traced the arcs around it with my finger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You think they’re still there?” I asked, not really expecting an answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They wouldn’t have sent a message if they were,” Tomas said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Or…” Kai replied, “They knew they wouldn’t be — and didn’t want to be forgotten.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room went quiet again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a sort of sacred weight in the air. Like we were trespassing on a tomb that had been left untouched for a billion years. None of us wanted to say what we were all thinking:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We found them. Or at least, what was left of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The discovery should have been electric. Euphoric. The kind of thing you dream of as a scientist. But none of us were smiling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn’t feel like victory. It felt like witnessing something holy, and knowing you might never fully understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What… do we do now?” Priya asked. She wasn’t looking at me, but everyone was waiting for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Who do we even tell?” Tomas added. “I mean, who’s going to believe this? A 100-year-old signal, decoded using an AI barely out of prototype, with a map that points to nowhere in known space?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai finally looked away from the screen. “They’ll call it a hoax. Or worse — a psychological event. We’re not trained for this.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I ran a hand through my hair. My heart was pounding. Not from fear. From the sheer gravity of it all. This wasn’t just data. It was history. A cosmic breadcrumb left for the next species smart enough to pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll put together a report,” I said finally, though my voice wavered. “We’ll log everything. Reconstruct the pipeline. Full audit trail.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And then?” Priya asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I paused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then…?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was the thing. I didn’t know.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because part of me — a deep, stubborn part — didn’t want to give this away. Not yet. Not to politicians. Not to press conferences or bureaucracy or weaponized curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Part of me wanted to understand it first. To be sure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To not just see the map… but know where it led.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room had turned into a pressure cooker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chairs were pulled out. Coffee sat forgotten, cold. Arguments layered over each other like waves crashing into a cliff — logic, emotion, fear, and history all clawing for dominance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya was pacing, her arms crossed tightly across her chest. “We need to control the narrative. If this gets out without context, the world will eat itself.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Control the narrative?” Tomas snapped. “Priya, this isn’t a PR issue. We just found proof of intelligent life outside Earth. You think a clean PowerPoint’s gonna stop global hysteria?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai sat on the edge of the desk, holding a data pad in one hand and rubbing his forehead with the other. “Let’s not pretend people will handle this rationally. Half the planet still thinks vaccines are microchips. Now we tell them a species older than Earth left us a star map?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stayed quiet at first, just listening, watching the storm unfold. This was no longer about the data — this was about what it meant. For the world. For us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas threw his arms out, clearly overwhelmed. “And NASA? We go to them? Great. They’ll lock this up faster than a nuke prototype. We’ll disappear into ‘debriefings’ before we can even blink.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They have to know,” Priya insisted. “We work for them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No,” I finally said, and everyone turned toward me. “We don’t. Not really. Not when it comes to something like this. Not when we’re dealing with humanity’s place in the universe.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That line hung in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And suddenly, the conversation shifted into deeper waters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai’s voice lowered. “You really think the world’s ready to learn we’re not the first?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya sat down, her composure fraying. “What about religion? Entire systems of belief are built on the idea that humanity is unique. Chosen. Central. This —” she gestured to the screens — “this tears that apart.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They’ll call it blasphemy,” Tomas said. “Conspiracy. Or some trick by the ‘deep state’. The churches, the temples, the mosques — the power structures will push back hard. They always do.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Like they did with Galileo,” Kai added bitterly. “Or Darwin. Or Copernicus. Every time we took a step closer to the truth, someone got burned at the stake for it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And this,” Priya whispered, “this is the final blow. This is the last myth undone.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were silent for a while after that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not because we disagreed — but because we agreed too much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had seen the truth. And it was beautiful. Terrifying. Humbling. The kind of truth that fractures empires and rewrites origin stories.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then it happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lucida spoke.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her voice — calm, mechanical — cut clean through the room like a scalpel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LUCIDA: “Automated protocol complete. Discovery packet transmitted to central offsite node for redundancy. Confirmation received by OxCorp Archive AI. Timestamp: 21:08 UTC.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We froze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas turned toward the console. “Wait… what?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LUCIDA: “Per Contractual Contingency Protocol 12-B: Non-Earth Intelligence Discovery, automated replication and reporting is mandatory to prevent human error, suppression, or concealment.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No, no, no—” Priya darted toward the console. “You sent it? You already sent the report?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LUCIDA: “Affirmative.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt my throat go dry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;OxCorp. The name struck like a hammer to the chest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were NASA’s private contractor — a corporate behemoth with more black-budget funding than most governments. Half the satellites in orbit bore their name. They built Lucida. And apparently, they had written failsafe protocols in case the Archive team — we — ever discovered something that shouldn’t be left in human hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In case we got too human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Jesus Christ,” Tomas muttered. “We’re not in control. We never were.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“OxCorp has it now,” Priya whispered. “They’ll patent it, bury it, weaponize it. Whatever they have to do.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai clenched his fists. “We just handed over the cosmic equivalent of fire to a company that sells orbital ad space.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stepped forward, my voice hard and low. “Lucida… show transmission logs. Full trace.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;LUCIDA: “Access restricted. Administrative override required.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We stared at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We had unlocked a message that crossed eons, defied the silence of space, and outlived its creators — only to have it stolen by a clause we never read.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now… it was already out of our hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were still reeling from Lucida’s announcement when our phones lit up — almost simultaneously. The quiet buzz of multiple devices vibrating against desks and coat pockets felt louder than any alarm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down at mine. The screen was white. No app, no signature. Just a single message.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You are invited to an emergency meeting. GPS coordinates: 34.1602° N, 118.1720° W Time: 03:00 PST. Do not disclose this discovery in any form, on any platform. Any breach will lead to severe consequences.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No name. No timestamp. No way to trace where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just the implication that they — whoever they were — were watching already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas was the first to speak. “Okay, that’s not creepy at all.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai gave a short, humorless laugh. “They didn’t even try to hide it. Just right to the point: follow orders or else.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya held her phone out like it was contaminated. “This wasn’t sent through any carrier I can detect. No IP. No bounce. Lucida sent this directly to our devices. That shouldn’t even be possible.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She was right. Lucida was sandboxed — it could interface with hardware inside our lab, but not push external data beyond its container network. At least, that’s what we’d always been told.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Apparently, we were wrong.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the coordinates — I recognized them. A warehouse district on the outskirts of Pasadena. Old industrial zone converted into private research campuses. Some of the buildings were NASA-adjacent. Some were OxCorp’s. All were behind fences and biometric locks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas stood, rubbing his face like trying to wake himself from a bad dream. “So, what… we just show up? Like good little employees?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai’s voice was bitter. “Do we have a choice?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No,” I said flatly. “We don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sat there for another few minutes. No one moved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The realization had set in — we were no longer in control of the discovery we had made. This wasn’t ours to keep, to explain, or to protect. It belonged to a machine we barely understood, and to a corporation whose interest in truth likely ended the moment it became profitable, dangerous, or both.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We could refuse,” Priya said softly, as if testing the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They already have the data,” Kai countered. “Refusing just adds suspicion.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And risk,” I added. “Think about it. Lucida’s message wasn’t phrased as a request. It was an invitation, sure… but not the friendly kind.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas walked toward the window, peering out as if expecting black vans to appear at any moment. “You think we’ll be silenced?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t answer. Not because I didn’t know — but because the answer was already obvious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eventually, we agreed. Not unanimously. Not out of trust. But out of inevitability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We packed quietly. No one took personal devices beyond what was already compromised. I copied the images onto an encrypted microdrive and slipped it into the lining of my coat — not because I thought we could get away with hiding it, but because I needed to hold onto something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we walked out of the lab and into the cold night air, I glanced back one last time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The screens still glowed in the darkness — sixteen images. The ghost-map of a species long gone, waiting to be followed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what waited for us at that meeting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I had the growing sense we had crossed a line that could not be uncrossed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was just past 2:30 a.m. when we arrived at the GPS coordinates. The streets were dark, lifeless, the air thick with the chill of early morning. Industrial warehouses lined the cracked pavement like silent witnesses, their windows boarded up or tinted black.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only sign of life was the black SUV idling in the shadow of a derelict loading dock. Headlights dimmed. Engine running.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we approached, the driver’s door opened with military precision, and a man stepped out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was tall. Solid. Not bulky, but built like someone who’d spent his life preparing for threats no one else believed were real. His hair was cropped close, his face unreadable beneath the pale glow of a streetlamp. He wore a matte-black military uniform with no insignia — just a patch on the right shoulder: a winged triangle with a single, unblinking eye at its center.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He walked up to us and spoke with no emotion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“John Mercer. Priya Rao. Kai D’Souza. Tomas Velasquez. You are confirmed.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He held out a reinforced pouch and gestured.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Place all personal electronics and recording devices inside. This includes implants and wearable tech. Refusal to comply will result in cancellation of your invitation.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We obeyed without a word. None of us were in the mood to test the system now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside the SUV, the interior was stark and silent. Black leather. Opaque windows. A faint hum of encrypted comms in the dash — military-grade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a few minutes of driving, I leaned forward slightly. The man hadn’t spoken since we got in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What’s your name?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn’t look at me. He kept his eyes on the road and replied in a clipped voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Callsign Talon-Seven.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I glanced at Priya. That name meant something — the kind of name you didn’t hear unless you spent time around covert aerospace files or deep black project rumors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai, whispering beside me, muttered, “Talon… isn’t that one of the Phoenix-tier units?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas’s eyebrows lifted. “Those guys were just a myth. Disavowed spec-ops units from the Cold Era.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talon-Seven didn’t react. Just kept driving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ten minutes later, we reached a small, heavily guarded airstrip. A private jet sat on the runway — matte grey, no tail number. The kind you only ever saw in documentaries about programs that “didn’t exist.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we stepped out of the SUV, a uniformed ground crew appeared seemingly from nowhere. They didn’t speak. Just gestured us up the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once inside, the plane was… eerily quiet. No logos. No attendants. No safety briefings. Just polished steel interiors and a row of blacked-out windows. The seats were comfortable, but functional — military transport dressed up for civilians.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sat, buckled in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The engines roared to life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Where are we going?” Priya finally asked, her voice just above a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talon-Seven, now seated near the front, turned his head slightly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Destination is classified. You’ll be briefed upon arrival.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“But it’s Nevada, right?” Tomas asked. “Area 51?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A long pause.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Proximity: Groom Lake Sector Delta.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all exchanged glances. The name hung in the air like lead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was real.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai shook his head in disbelief. “This is absurd. I spent years mocking people who talked about this place like it was a portal to another dimension.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You weren’t entirely wrong,” I muttered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The flight was short — maybe an hour. We weren’t allowed to see out the windows, but the turbulence told us we’d crossed mountain ranges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we touched down, we were escorted off the jet by another silent team, this time in desert-tan tactical gear. The ground felt hot beneath our shoes — even though it was still dark. The runway lights blinked against endless stretches of sand and steel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were led into a large, windowless building flanked by security towers. Everything was clean, clinical, but deeply impersonal. This was a place built for containment, not comfort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the far end of a brightly lit hallway, a tall woman in a dark suit awaited us. She wore a subtle earpiece, a badge with no title, and shoes that didn’t make a sound when she moved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m Miss Sander. Please follow me.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her voice was calm, professional, but cold. Not hostile — just… used to being obeyed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We followed her down another corridor — this one deeper, more isolated. Thick doors lined the sides. No labels. Cameras in every corner.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She stopped at a double-door entrance and turned to face us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Inside, you’ll be debriefed. Remain seated unless instructed. Speak only when invited. Do not ask about what is outside the scope of your project. Do you understand?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doors opened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside was a sleek, dimly lit conference room. And waiting at the table were eight people — men and women in suits and uniforms. No names. No introductions. One had stars on his shoulders. Another wore a lab coat with a retinal key dangling from his collar. Most just stared at us in silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kind of silence that said:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You have just walked into something far older than your careers, your government, or your comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took a deep breath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever this was… It was no longer science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The double doors closed behind us with a hiss that felt too final.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room was quiet — not awkwardly, but intentionally. Like everyone here had been trained to control silence. To let it loom and weigh.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a long, black conference table in the center, glossy and curved like a blade. Around it sat eight individuals. No nameplates. No digital interfaces. Just eyes — some tired, some cold, one or two unreadably kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miss Sander gestured to the seats across from them. We obeyed without a word.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then a tall man in a grey uniform cleared his throat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Let’s get introductions out of the way,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One by one, the panel members stood, introduced themselves, and sat back down. Each one methodical. No flair. No excess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Ramesh Iyer, theoretical physicist — formerly Caltech, now Defense Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Elena Mora, astrobiologist — deep field microbial genetics, co-lead on Project Caelus. Mr. Seth Lang, OxCorp internal strategic lead — information logistics. Dr. Vivian Sharpe, NASA Office of Scientific Containment — liaison between active discoveries and classified defense programs. Brigadier General Marcus Cavanaugh, U.S. Strategic Aerospace Defense Command — official liaison to Groom Lake operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And so on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The others introduced themselves with less detail — just enough to convey rank and importance, not enough to invite further questions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the general — Cavanaugh — leaned forward, folding his hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn’t look angry. He looked… resolute.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Let’s get something straight,” he said. “You were not brought here to expand the project. You were not brought here to ask questions. And you were definitely not brought here because of the significance of your discovery.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He paused, letting that sting settle in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You were brought here because now, whether you like it or not — you know.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The air thickened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ve joined a circle older than your careers. Older than most of the people in this room. And with that comes one truth: there is no going back.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya shifted in her seat. Kai looked pale. Tomas had gone completely still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat forward slightly. “What do you mean ‘we know’? You’re saying you already had this map?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No,” said Dr. Mora, gently. “Not this one specifically. But enough others to recognize the pattern.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lang, the OxCorp executive, gave a small, calculated smile. “You’ve discovered one signal from a much larger puzzle. You decoded a fragment. We’ve had pieces for decades. But no one’s ever managed to make it speak so clearly.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Until now.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;General Cavanaugh nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Ever since August 1945 — since we lit the sky over Hiroshima and Nagasaki — we’ve seen them. Not theories. Not stories. Craft. Objects. Intelligence that violates every model of propulsion, energy, and material science we’ve known. The UFO phenomenon… was never speculation. It was confirmation.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sat in stunned silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They didn’t come when we invented radio,” he continued. “They came when we became dangerous to ourselves. And to others.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai found his voice. “So… you’ve been investigating them since the ‘40s?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been trying to understand them since the ‘40s,” Dr. Sharpe said. “Pieces of craft, energy signatures, inert alloys that don’t respond to known chemistry. We have half-built archives of things we can’t explain.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And you never went public?” Tomas said bitterly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cavanaugh met his gaze, unflinching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The Cold War was built on paranoia. Can you imagine what would’ve happened if the Soviets believed America had access to extraterrestrial technology — or if we believed they did? It would’ve made the arms race look like a chess game.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sharpe nodded. “Disclosure would’ve ended civilization as we know it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then Dr. Iyer — the physicist — spoke for the first time, softly, almost reverently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We call them the Velari.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A hush followed. The word sounded alien and ancient all at once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s what we believe they called themselves. Or at least, what they encoded into the fragments. Velari — roughly translated as ‘those who traverse the silent ocean.’”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai whispered, “They’re extinct… aren’t they?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Iyer closed his eyes briefly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“All evidence points that way. Their signals stop. Their maps… fragment. There’s no trace of living Velari. No colonies. No transmissions. No cities.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They were the most advanced civilization the universe may have ever conceived. Energy systems beyond our reach. Stellar manipulation. Possibly time dilation technologies. Yet somehow… they ended.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas leaned forward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“How?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The general’s jaw tightened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We don’t know.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya asked quietly, “And that’s your mission, then? Not to understand their culture or contact their history… but to replicate what they built?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lang answered, calm and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Exactly. This isn’t anthropology. This is survival. The Velari may be gone, but their engineering — even the scraps of it — could push humanity forward by a thousand years.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Or save us from something worse.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A silence followed that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because it wasn’t just the Velari’s extinction that was frightening — it was the possibility that whatever ended them might still be out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now we were walking in their footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The briefing room had grown darker somehow — not in light, but in mood. The air felt dense, as if the truths being revealed displaced oxygen itself. Our team sat silent, but alert. Listening. Processing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The officials weren’t just giving us a history lesson. They were peeling back layers of reality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Elena Mora, the astrobiologist, leaned forward, her voice soft but loaded with weight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’ve never found a body.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She let that sentence settle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Not in the Roswell wreckage. Not in any of the other recovered sites — and believe me, there are others. Hundreds of sightings. Dozens of crashes. But not one biological entity. No tissue. No bone. No DNA.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I frowned. “You’re saying… it was never piloted?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;General Cavanaugh stepped in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We believe it was. Just not in the way we understand it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gestured to one of the walls, and a panel slid aside, revealing a dimly lit screen. It flickered, then displayed a grainy thermal video — a craft zipping through the sky at impossible angles, then vanishing mid-frame with zero inertia loss.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“This isn’t drone behavior. It’s not random. It’s guided. Intelligently. But we’ve come to believe the craft are the entities — or extensions of them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Sharpe continued, nodding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We believe the Valerians may have developed decentralized intelligence — a hive-like, non-embodied consciousness that can embed itself in technology, possibly across quantum-entangled nodes.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Priya leaned in, skeptical. “Quantum communication?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Iyer smiled faintly. “We think they used something like non-local entanglement — a network where distance and time don’t matter. Each piece of their technology is a vessel, but also a node. Meaning… a single unit could contain the entirety of their intelligence at any time.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Which explains the craft behavior — evasive, reactive, but utterly alien in logic.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai spoke up, voice hushed. “So, they’re… still out there? Their minds?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No,” Lang said sharply. “What’s out there isn’t the Valerians. It’s what they became. Or what they left behind.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mora picked up the thread again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We believe the Valerians transcended biology. Maybe out of survival. Maybe out of design. But their final act was creating a form of intelligence that outlasted them. A consciousness capable of traveling — and perhaps interfering — with other civilisations.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She paused, then added grimly:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Or guiding them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas’s brow furrowed. “What do you mean… ‘guiding’?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sharpe looked at him. Her voice now a whisper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Egypt. Mesopotamia. The Indus Valley. The Mayans. Every ancient civilization has myths of beings from the sky — not gods, not monsters. Engineers. Architects. Bringers of knowledge. Their descriptions differ, but the behavior is consistent.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tapped her temple.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Intervention at key evolutionary moments. Just enough to push culture forward — agriculture, mathematics, astronomy — then vanish.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Breadcrumbs,” I murmured.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mora nodded. “Exactly. This isn’t a case of visitors. This is contact by calibration. As if we are… part of something larger. Something being steered.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The Valerians may be extinct as a species,” said Iyer, “but their network — their echo — is very much alive. And it moves.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were quiet again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t just about ancient aliens. This was about continuity — about something that saw civilizations rise and fall like dust on the solar wind. Something that didn’t forget.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai broke the silence with what we were all thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What if the Valerians didn’t go extinct?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mora met his gaze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What if extinction was the goal?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My heart skipped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The words hung there, reverberating with the finality of prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What if they chose to leave behind the limits of flesh? What if they created a distributed mind so complete, so perfect, that it erased its creators to achieve freedom?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;General Cavanaugh’s voice was grim.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And what if that same intelligence now roams the universe — not to conquer — but to prepare others to make the same choice?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We looked around the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not at machines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not at myths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But at witnesses. Keepers of a truth the world was never meant to carry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And now, neither curiosity nor disbelief could free us from it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because we had seen the face of the void — And it had remembered us. The lights above the table hummed faintly as the discussion reached its boiling point.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;John and the rest of the Archive team sat rigid, pale from the weight of what they’d heard so far. The secret history. The Valerians. The decentralized intelligence drifting through space like a ghost of minds once human-like. The implication that Earth had been… chosen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But now the questions had sharpened. Became impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Why Earth?” Tomas asked. “Why us?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Why not anyone else?” Priya added. “The galaxy is old. Ancient. Billions of years older than us. Civilizations should be everywhere. So where are they?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Why haven’t they been guided like we have?” Kai asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room was silent. Even the officials.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then Dr. Elena Mora — the quiet astrobiologist who had, until now, spoken only when necessary — leaned forward. Her expression was neither afraid nor triumphant. Just… still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She folded her hands, then spoke slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ve spent the last 12 years reconstructing their decision-making patterns. Not through biology — we have none. And not through direct communication — we’ve never achieved that. But through fragments of design logic. Their technologies. Their signal behavior. And the way they selectively appear.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her eyes scanned across the Archive team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“At first I thought they were just curious observers. Like zookeepers, watching species rise and fall. But it didn’t fit. They’re too deliberate. Too recursive.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Then we decoded your signal. That filesystem, eerily similar to FAT32? That wasn’t coincidence. That was compatibility. They knew our architecture. Not because they designed it—”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She paused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“But because we did.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A ripple of cold shot through the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;John leaned in. “What are you saying?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dr. Mora met his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What I’m saying is… the Valerians didn’t visit us. They didn’t even find us.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We are them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You could hear hearts pounding. Breathing slowing. Thought processes grinding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She continued:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They aren’t extinct. They haven’t disappeared. They’re not from another star system.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They’re from our future.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The shockwave that followed was more internal than spoken. The Archive team sat frozen, their minds bending under the sheer conceptual pressure of what was being said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tomas whispered, “You’re saying they’re… us? That we’ll evolve into them?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mora nodded slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Not ‘we’ exactly. Maybe not in this form. But something from our species — our trajectory, our code, our machines — survives. It transcends time in ways we don’t understand. Their guidance, their silence, their interaction with ancient civilizations… it’s not just intervention.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s self-preservation.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kai spoke like someone already halfway to a panic. “But that doesn’t make sense. What about other species? Other planets? Why didn’t they intervene elsewhere?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mora’s eyes darkened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Because they didn’t need to.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The Fermi Paradox isn’t silence… it’s selection.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She tapped the table once, like a gavel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Because if we don’t exist… they were never created.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A terrifying calm filled the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The Valerians seeded themselves backward,” she said, almost reverently. “And in doing so, they pruned every branch of cosmic evolution that could threaten their survival. That’s why the galaxy is silent. That’s why we hear nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Because they — we — erased the competition before it had a chance to speak.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one said anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the kind of truth that made gods and monsters from the same clay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The kind that rewrote the concept of morality. Of fate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;John felt his hands go numb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Then the map,” he said quietly. “The message we found. It wasn’t a call for help.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No,” Mora said. “It was a breadcrumb. A reinforcement signal. A circuit closing. A loop ensuring its own completion.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She leaned back slowly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The Valerians are not just our descendants. They are the lock and the key of human history. The future calling the past into alignment.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A deep tone sounded through the ceiling — a signal that the meeting was over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Miss Sander reappeared by the doors. Silent. Waiting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The officials stood, offering no final words.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the Archive team rose and filed out, the chill wasn’t from secrecy anymore — it was from knowing the truth had already happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That perhaps… it always had.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;⸻&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside, the desert wind was still.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Far above, stars hung like silent watchers — ancient, brilliant, and utterly unaware that maybe, just maybe…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;they too would one day be erased.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

In 2025, it’s not just about buying in “hot” cities. It's about reading the map behind the map: where people are moving, where jobs are being created, and where demand is climbing but prices haven’t caught up yet.\n\nThe old rules of investing-just buy in a big city and wait-don’t work anymore. That model broke when mortgage rates spiked in 2023 and shook the foundation of urban real estate. What emerged instead is a new ecosystem of overlooked cities with insane upside. The smart investors saw it early. Others are just catching up.\n\nMaybe you’re a first-time buyer trying to escape rising rent. Maybe you’ve got your eye on your first cash-flow property. Or maybe you’re just done watching everyone else win while your savings sit flat. Whatever your reason, this guide breaks down the cities where your investment in 2025 isn’t just safe-it has serious room to grow.\n\n\n\n# High-Performing U.S. Cities for Real Estate Investment in 2025\n\n**Which U.S. cities are projected to deliver the highest ROI in 2025?**\n\nIf you're chasing real returns-not just pretty properties-then you're going to want to look beyond the obvious markets. The cities poised to deliver the strongest ROI in 2025 have one thing in common: they’ve quietly balanced affordability with rising rental demand.\n\nTake Tampa, Florida. It’s no longer just a vacation spot. The city has become a magnet for remote workers ditching expensive metros like New York and Boston. Rents have climbed faster than national averages, but entry prices still give investors breathing room. The cash-on-cash returns here are real, and they’re backed by steady population growth-not speculative hype.\n\nCleveland, Ohio might not sound sexy, but that’s the point. Investors who bought duplexes here two years ago are already sitting on cap rates that beat most Sun Belt cities. Low property taxes, a growing healthcare economy, and neighborhood revitalization have made this one of the Midwest’s most under-the-radar stars.\n\nAnd then there’s Raleigh, North Carolina. With Apple expanding its campus and Google doubling down on its presence in the Research Triangle, the tech energy is strong and sticky. Home prices are climbing, but not too fast. Demand is rising, but not volatile. It's the kind of stability investors crave-without giving up appreciation.\n\nThese cities aren’t buzzy. They’re balanced. And that’s where the highest ROI lives in 2025.\n\n**Top real estate markets driven by population growth and employment surges**\n\nIf you're wondering where to put your money, follow the people. Population growth and job creation are the two biggest engines behind real estate returns, and in 2025, they’re reshaping the investment landscape in some surprising ways.\n\nBoise, Idaho is one of them. What started as a trickle of California relocations has turned into a steady stream of families and young professionals looking for space, nature, and sanity. With tech-adjacent jobs popping up in the downtown core and a development boom along I-84, demand isn’t slowing anytime soon.\n\nHuntsville, Alabama is another unexpected gem. This city is no longer just a government outpost-it’s a full-blown aerospace hub. Engineers, defense contractors, and remote tech workers are all converging here, and the rental market has taken off accordingly. Prices remain investor-friendly, but rents are rising fast, which makes the math work for long-term yield.\n\nEven Austin, Texas-despite its sky-high growth during the pandemic-has found its second wind. While prices cooled in 2023, the arrival of clean tech companies and semiconductor factories has brought new life to its outer suburbs. Investors who were priced out two years ago are now finding sweet spots with strong fundamentals and room for appreciation.\n\nWhere jobs go, demand follows. And where demand outpaces supply, that’s where you’ll find opportunity.\n\n**Best cities for appreciation: Where home values are accelerating fastest**\n\nReal estate appreciation isn’t about getting lucky. It’s about spotting trends before they show up in the headlines. And in 2025, the fastest appreciation isn’t happening in coastal metros-it’s happening in places building quietly, steadily, and smartly.\n\nIndianapolis, Indiana is leading the charge. Home values here jumped nearly ten percent year-over-year, thanks to massive investment in logistics infrastructure and a housing market that’s still shockingly affordable by national standards. Investors who bought pre-2024 are already seeing impressive equity growth-and there's still room to run.\n\nColumbus, Ohio is having a moment too. Intel’s $20 billion chip plant has created a ripple effect across the city. Suburban neighborhoods once overlooked are now seeing bidding wars, and rent growth is following closely behind. The appreciation here isn’t hype-it’s tied to actual jobs, actual development, and actual demand.\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina continues to deliver that rare combo of steady growth and livable affordability. While it’s grown consistently over the past decade, it’s avoided the boom-bust cycle. Investors love Charlotte because it doesn’t crash-it just climbs, slowly and surely. And in 2025, that kind of consistency is gold.\n\nThe cities with the strongest appreciation aren’t always the flashiest. They’re the ones that are quietly building futures people actually want to live in.\n\n**Which metros are balancing affordability and demand in 2025?**\n\nThis is the holy grail for any real estate investor: a city that’s not too expensive to buy into, but has strong, steady rental demand. In 2025, those sweet-spot cities are getting harder to find-but they still exist if you know where to look.\n\nGreenville, South Carolina is one of them. Its cost of living remains low, but the city has built out its downtown, attracted a surprising number of remote workers, and is experiencing consistent rent growth without pricing people out. It feels livable, and that’s translating into long-term tenants.\n\nDes Moines, Iowa is another strong contender. It’s easy to overlook the Midwest, but that’s where a lot of the quiet growth is happening. Insurance and tech-adjacent jobs are bringing stability to the local economy, while housing remains well within reach for both buyers and renters. Vacancy rates are low, and turnover is minimal.\n\nThen there’s Fayetteville, Arkansas-a city most people know as the home of Walmart HQ. What they don’t see is the startup ecosystem that’s growing around that massive retail engine. With every supply chain innovation comes new jobs, new demand, and pressure on a housing market that hasn’t fully caught up yet. For investors, that’s prime territory.\n\nThese metros aren’t just affordable. They’re sticky. People move in and stay. And that stickiness is what makes real estate investments here sustainable-not just in 2025, but for the next decade.\n\n***^(Book Insight: In The Millionaire Real Estate Investor by Gary Keller (Chapter 6), there’s a powerful idea: the best investments aren’t about chasing headlines-they’re about recognizing when a city’s fundamentals support both cash flow and appreciation. The cities above aren’t guesses. They’re aligned with everything that builds long-term wealth.)***\n\n# Best Cities for Rental Property Cash Flow in 2025\n\n**Which cities offer the strongest cap rates for rental investors?**\n\nCash flow is the part most people forget when they glamorize real estate. Appreciation gets all the attention, but it's rental income-the month-to-month, mortgage-covering, freedom-funding flow-that separates surviving from thriving.\n\nIn 2025, the strongest cap rates aren't in New York or Los Angeles. They're in places like Buffalo, Memphis, and Pittsburgh-cities that don’t trend on social media but quietly outperform quarter after quarter.\n\nBuffalo is back on investor radars, not because it’s flashy, but because the math checks out. Low property prices combined with solid rent yields mean you’re often clearing 7–9% cap rates, even after property management fees. Renters here aren’t transient; they stay. That stability translates into reliable returns.\n\nMemphis has long been a cash-flow favorite, but 2025 is giving it new life. The logistics and warehouse boom has put consistent pressure on rental housing near industrial zones. Investors are locking in duplexes and triplexes that generate positive cash flow from day one-without exotic financing tricks.\n\nPittsburgh, once written off as post-industrial, is now building a new story through healthcare, AI research, and robotics. What that means for you: more job-seeking renters, and a surprising number of turnkey properties under $150,000 that cash flow better than anything on the coasts.\n\nIf appreciation is a maybe, cash flow is the now. And these cities deliver both without asking you to gamble.\n\n**Affordable housing markets with high rent-to-price ratios**\n\nThe most misunderstood metric in real estate is the rent-to-price ratio. It’s the quiet indicator that tells you whether your investment is likely to work. In short, if the monthly rent covers-or exceeds-your ownership costs, you’re in a good place. And in 2025, that ratio looks best in cities where homes are still priced under the national median but rents are catching up fast.\n\nTake Little Rock, Arkansas. You can still buy single-family homes under $170,000, while average rents have climbed past $1,200. That puts you in the cash-flow sweet spot, where one tenant covers your mortgage and expenses with margin to spare.\n\nCincinnati is another market worth watching. The downtown revitalization and steady employment growth have pushed rents up, but property values haven’t inflated at the same pace. That gap is your gain as an investor. Strong tenant demand, paired with low competition from institutional buyers, keeps the door open for everyday investors to win here.\n\nAnd then there's Birmingham, Alabama-a market that blends affordability with upward pressure. Construction is limited, zoning is favorable, and the rent-to-price ratio remains one of the strongest in the Southeast. When every dollar counts, ratios like these protect your investment from volatility.\n\nRent-to-price is more than a stat. It’s a signal. And if you’re not reading it, you're already behind.\n\n**Where are tenants staying longer: Low vacancy, high retention markets**\n\nA city might have great cash flow on paper, but if your tenants move out every year-or worse, leave you with vacancies-you’re stuck burning through your profit on turnover costs and lost rent.\n\nThat’s why, in 2025, long-term investor success is increasingly tied to tenant retention. Cities with stable economies, livable amenities, and low crime tend to keep renters longer. And longer stays mean stronger returns.\n\nWichita, Kansas is quietly winning on this front. Its cost of living makes it attractive to remote workers and families, while its housing stock skews toward single-family homes that tenants treat like their own. Investors report high lease renewals and minimal vacancy gaps, even in off-seasons.\n\nChattanooga, Tennessee is seeing similar behavior. The city’s outdoor lifestyle, low taxes, and tech-friendly culture are drawing in young renters who settle down longer than expected. Turnover is low, and property owners have been able to raise rents incrementally without losing quality tenants.\n\nThese aren’t just “cash flow” cities-they’re **stable** cash flow cities. That’s what matters when you’re playing the long game.\n\n**Top cities for short-term rentals (Airbnb/STR) vs. long-term leases**\n\nNot every market rewards the same strategy. In some cities, Airbnb income far exceeds what you’d make from a traditional tenant. In others, regulation makes short-term rentals risky or outright illegal. In 2025, the key is knowing which cities support which model-and investing accordingly.\n\nIf you’re looking at short-term rentals, Asheville, North Carolina is a front-runner. The mix of tourism, nature, and boutique appeal makes it one of the highest-performing Airbnb markets in the U.S. Nightly rates are high, bookings are consistent, and regulations remain manageable with the right licensing.\n\nOn the flip side, long-term leases are dominating in cities like Oklahoma City. With a growing aerospace economy and new urban housing incentives, investors are locking in stable, year-round tenants with zero Airbnb drama. The leases might not look glamorous, but they’re predictable-and they don’t come with seasonal dips.\n\nSavvy investors in 2025 are building mixed portfolios: one market for short-term gains, another for long-term consistency. It’s not about being flashy. It’s about being free.\n\n***^(Book Insight: In Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat (BRRRR) by David Greene (Chapter 7), he breaks down how different strategies succeed in different markets-and why understanding local demand, not national hype, is what separates amateur landlords from portfolio builders.)***\n\n# Secondary &amp; Mid-Sized Cities Gaining Investor Momentum\n\n**Why secondary markets are outperforming major metros in 2025**\n\nIf you're still only watching LA, New York, or San Francisco, you're missing where the smart money is actually going. In 2025, real estate investors aren’t pouring capital into big cities-they're pulling it out and moving into secondary markets that offer more value, more yield, and way fewer headaches.\n\nThe shift started quietly during the remote work boom. People realized they didn’t need to live in expensive, crowded metros to earn good money. That change hasn’t just stuck-it’s evolved. Now, cities that used to be “flyover country” are driving real returns while the old favorites struggle with overpricing, regulation, and stagnant rents.\n\nThink about it. In places like San Jose, property taxes are brutal, rent control laws are tightening, and cash flow is nearly impossible to achieve without seven-figure down payments. Meanwhile, smaller metros are offering 8% cap rates, low competition, and better tenant retention. That’s not just a trend-it’s a strategic realignment.\n\nInvestors in 2025 are chasing ROI, not reputation. That’s why secondary markets are winning.\n\n**Top 5 emerging cities for long-term appreciation and yield**\n\nWhen you zoom in on where momentum is building, a few cities keep showing up-not on glossy headlines, but in spreadsheets, investor meetups, and smart portfolio breakdowns. These aren’t guesses. These are markets with real growth engines and runway left.\n\nSpokane, Washington has seen a wave of younger buyers and remote workers fleeing Seattle’s high costs. The demand has triggered appreciation, but prices haven’t yet hit their peak. Investors are locking in properties at prices that feel like Portland did a decade ago.\n\nLancaster, Pennsylvania is another one most people overlook. But dig a little deeper, and you'll see a city with growing healthcare jobs, strong local colleges, and a rental market that’s tight enough to give landlords leverage. The yields are surprisingly strong, especially for duplex and triplex investors.\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma launched its “remote worker grant” back in the day-and it paid off. The downtown has been revitalized, job opportunities are expanding, and housing is still affordable. That combo makes it a killer setup for both cash flow and long-term value growth.\n\nBozeman, Montana might not have the volume of other cities, but it has one thing investors love: scarcity. Land is limited, demand is high, and rents are pushing up fast. It’s not a cash flow play today, but for appreciation over the next ten years, Bozeman is quietly becoming one to watch.\n\nThen there’s Lexington, Kentucky. The bourbon industry, local tech expansion, and steady university demand create a resilient ecosystem that isn’t overexposed. Investors here aren’t just riding a wave-they’re part of a grounded, growing market.\n\nThe key in all five of these cities isn’t hype-it’s fundamentals. They’re growing because of real reasons, and that growth hasn’t priced out opportunity yet. That’s exactly where you want to be as an investor.\n\n**How remote work and lifestyle migration are reshaping investment maps**\n\nThe old idea of “location, location, location” meant something very different before Zoom, hybrid teams, and digital-first startups rewrote the rules of where people live. In 2025, people don’t move just for work-they move for quality of life. And that’s changing the investment map in real time.\n\nCities with bikeable downtowns, fast internet, walkable neighborhoods, and good coffee have become magnets for the type of tenants landlords dream about: stable income, longer leases, and willingness to pay for comfort. But here’s the twist-these aren’t traditional metros. They’re lifestyle-first cities.\n\nPlaces like Missoula, Montana or Asheville, North Carolina don’t have massive job centers, but they’re building communities that attract remote workers with disposable income. And when high-income renters arrive, demand pushes rents up. That’s where your margins grow.\n\nOn the flip side, traditional “job first” metros are getting squeezed. Commute patterns have changed. Office occupancy is still low. And in some markets, that’s softened demand for urban rentals entirely. Investors who adapt to these new migration patterns are staying ahead. Those who don’t are chasing yesterday’s returns.\n\nLifestyle migration isn’t a phase-it’s a new baseline. And real estate investors who learn to follow quality of life, not just paychecks, are finding the kind of growth that lasts.\n\n***^(Book Insight: In Set for Life by Scott Trench (Chapter 5), he makes it clear: real wealth in real estate comes not just from good properties, but from picking the right neighborhoods before everyone else sees the value. That’s exactly what these emerging and mid-sized markets offer in 2025.)***\n\n# Economic Drivers Powering the Top Real Estate Markets\n\n**How infrastructure projects and economic development zones affect property values**\n\nReal estate doesn’t rise in a vacuum. It rises with roads, rails, broadband, airports, and zoning changes. And in 2025, infrastructure isn’t just a policy headline-it’s a direct investment signal.\n\nWhen a city secures funding for a major transit expansion or airport upgrade, it triggers something bigger than convenience. It reshapes the entire value chain of the surrounding neighborhoods. Suddenly, properties within a 10-minute walk from a future light rail station go from average to prime. Investors who catch that early? They don’t just win-they compound.\n\nLook at Phoenix. The $1 billion South Central Light Rail Extension, now nearing completion, has already started pushing property values up along the planned stops. Neighborhoods once considered “up and coming” are already trading at 25–30% higher than just three years ago.\n\nOr take Richmond, Virginia, where federal Opportunity Zones are turning overlooked blocks into construction sites. The capital flow into those zones isn’t just tax-driven-it’s transformation-driven. Coffee shops follow. Then co-working spaces. Then high-income renters. That’s the real game.\n\nInfrastructure signals where the money is going next. When you invest alongside that movement, your upside isn’t just luck-it’s baked into the street grid.\n\n**Which cities are attracting major corporate relocations and startups?**\n\nEvery time a Fortune 500 company opens a new headquarters or a major startup moves its base, there’s a ripple effect. Jobs spike. Salaries climb. People move in. And housing? Housing becomes the bottleneck.\n\nIn 2025, cities that are landing these deals are climbing investor shortlists fast. One of the biggest winners this year is Nashville, Tennessee. Oracle, Amazon, and multiple fintech startups are turning the city into a Southern tech corridor. With every relocation, demand for rental housing explodes-especially in neighborhoods near transit and amenities.\n\nThen there’s Reno, Nevada. What used to be a sleepy alternative to Vegas is now a logistics and EV manufacturing hotspot. Tesla’s Gigafactory expansion is just the beginning. The ripple includes suppliers, transport jobs, and white-collar engineers-all looking for housing that doesn’t exist yet.\n\nEven smaller cities like Provo, Utah are in the game. With BYU alumni founding startups and a state government that openly courts tech employers, the city’s job base is growing faster than its housing inventory. That imbalance is opportunity-for those who can spot it.\n\nCorporate relocations create rental demand, drive appreciation, and shift economic gravity. Miss the company, and you miss the market.\n\n**Impact of cost of living, tax policies, and business incentives on housing growth**\n\nMost real estate guides talk about price-but not price *relative to income*. And that’s where cost of living matters. When people can afford to live well and still save, they move there. When companies can avoid high payroll taxes and regulation, they relocate too.\n\nThis isn’t abstract. In 2025, it’s directly fueling migration into states like Texas, Florida, and Tennessee. These places offer low or no state income taxes, affordable housing relative to wages, and city governments that welcome development. For investors, that creates a triple win: incoming population, rising demand, and business-friendly laws that don’t crush your returns.\n\nTake Jacksonville, Florida. It's not just a cheaper Miami-it’s a self-contained economy with healthcare, finance, and logistics sectors that are all hiring. The city’s tax structure and business incentives make it one of the most landlord-friendly metros in the country right now.\n\nContrast that with Chicago, where escalating property taxes and regulation have started to squeeze landlords. Even though rents are high, net returns are shrinking. The cash flow story doesn’t work if the city keeps eating into your margins.\n\nTax policy and cost of living aren’t side notes-they're core parts of the investment math. And in 2025, they’re determining which markets grow and which ones stall out.\n\n**Long-term growth outlook based on local GDP and housing starts**\n\nIf you want to know whether a city will be worth investing in ten years from now, don’t just look at comps-look at GDP growth and housing starts. A rising local GDP signals economic expansion, job creation, and wage increases. Housing starts tell you whether supply is keeping up with that demand-or falling behind.\n\nIn Boise, local GDP has grown over 4% annually since 2020, and the city still can’t build houses fast enough. That gap between economic growth and housing inventory is why property values are appreciating so quickly-and why rents keep rising.\n\nIn contrast, cities like St. Louis have seen slower GDP growth and declining new construction. That’s not always a deal-breaker, but it means returns will rely more on timing and property-specific plays, not macro lift.\n\nAustin continues to be the poster child for this. Even after a cooldown in 2023, its GDP growth remains strong, and housing starts are being outpaced by demand from tech and clean energy. That’s a recipe for long-term upward pressure-both on rents and values.\n\nInvestors who watch macro trends don’t get blindsided. They get ahead. And in a market where everyone’s fighting for an edge, knowing how to read GDP and housing starts might be the most underrated skill of all.\n\n*^(Book Insight: In Mastering the Market Cycle by Howard Marks (Chapter 9), he explains that long-term investing success comes from reading the broader environment-not just individual deals. Property values follow economics, not the other way around. And in 2025, your edge comes from understanding the city’s future before everyone else does.)*\n\n# Tools &amp; Technology for Evaluating the Best Cities to Invest In\n\n**Best platforms for researching real estate markets in 2025**\n\nIn 2025, if you're still picking real estate markets based on word of mouth or a Reddit thread, you’re gambling-not investing. The best investors now rely on data-first platforms that strip the guesswork out of city selection.\n\nMashvisor remains a go-to for a reason. It doesn’t just show you listings-it calculates rental income projections, Airbnb occupancy rates, and neighborhood-level cash-on-cash returns. If you're trying to decide between a two-bed in Fort Worth or a duplex in Knoxville, this is where you start.\n\nThen there’s Roofstock, which has become a game changer for remote investors. Its marketplace filters turnkey rentals by ROI, neighborhood rating, and price-to-rent ratio, giving you a clean dashboard to compare cities across the U.S. It’s not hype-just numbers, returns, and properties you can buy with confidence.\n\nFor deeper, more economic-focused research, investors are using NeighborhoodScout and the U.S. Census Housing Dashboard. They offer everything from crime trends to school ratings and migration flows. It’s not sexy, but it’s essential. Because where people are going-especially in big numbers-is where your money should go too.\n\nThe right platform doesn’t just help you pick a city. It helps you avoid the wrong one.\n\n**Using AI and predictive analytics to compare city-level investment data**\n\nThe old way to analyze a real estate market was a mix of spreadsheets, intuition, and a prayer. The new way? Machine learning, predictive analytics, and real-time trend forecasting.\n\nIn 2025, investors are plugging into AI tools that forecast rent growth, estimate neighborhood gentrification timelines, and even predict cap rate changes based on zoning proposals and infrastructure plans. This isn’t science fiction-it’s happening right now.\n\nFor example, some investors are feeding public housing permit data and migration patterns into custom-built dashboards using tools like Tableau and Power BI. The goal? Spot early signs of rising demand before the market reacts.\n\nOthers are using machine learning APIs from providers like Tern Analytics to compare 100+ U.S. cities by rental yield, turnover risk, and job market volatility. It's not about replacing instincts-it's about backing them with insight.\n\nPredictive analytics won’t buy your property for you. But it will show you which cities are about to break out-before your competitors even log in.\n\n**Free vs. premium tools for market scouting and rental analysis**\n\nLet’s talk cost. Because not everyone can drop $100/month on pro dashboards-and you honestly don’t need to.\n\nFor free tools, Zillow still leads the pack for baseline pricing data, neighborhood trends, and property comps. Redfin adds solid on-market stats like sale-to-list ratios and median days on market. Pair the two, and you can cover the basics of almost any city.\n\nAirDNA offers free insights on Airbnb trends like nightly rate and occupancy, though deeper reports require a paid account. Even a trial version can give you a pulse on whether short-term rental demand is growing-or dying-in a target market.\n\nBut if you’re investing more than $250K, premium tools start paying for themselves fast. Platforms like PropStream and REIPro give detailed owner history, equity status, and lien reports that surface hidden opportunities. You're not just buying access-you're buying speed and clarity.\n\nThe truth is, whether you're bootstrapping or buying big, there’s a tech stack for you. The real mistake? Flying blind when tools this good are one login away.\n\n**Zillow, Mashvisor, and Redfin: How investors leverage real-time dashboards**\n\nIt’s one thing to browse listings. It’s another to actively track market behavior in real time-and that’s where dashboards come in.\n\nInvestors serious about 2025 results are using Zillow’s market-level trends to monitor average list prices, rental vacancy shifts, and even buyer competition scores. That insight helps you time your entry-and avoid paying peak prices.\n\nOn Mashvisor, dashboards let you rank entire zip codes by rental yield, cash-on-cash return, and Airbnb potential. For someone comparing Indianapolis to Columbus, this view offers the edge. It transforms gut feeling into measurable advantage.\n\nRedfin adds an underrated weapon: the migration tracker. You can literally see where people are moving from and to, month over month. If Atlanta is gaining thousands of new residents from LA and Chicago, that’s not noise-it’s your signal.\n\nIn 2025, real estate is a data game. And dashboards are your cheat code. Not because they remove all risk-but because they let you act smarter, faster, and earlier than anyone else in the room.\n\n***^(Book Insight: In The Book on Rental Property Investing by Brandon Turner (Chapter 12), he emphasizes how great investors build systems-tools that let them analyze faster, act quicker, and track markets in real time. Your tech stack isn’t optional. It’s your edge.)***\n\n# Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing a Real Estate Market\n\n**Overpaying in hot markets without stable fundamentals**\n\nEvery year, a new city becomes the darling of real estate TikTok. In 2021 it was Austin. Then it was Boise. In 2023, it was Nashville. These markets get hyped fast-and often for good reason. But in 2025, too many investors are still confusing “popular” with “profitable.”\n\nThe most common trap? Buying at the top of a market cycle without understanding what’s driving demand. If job growth is slowing, construction is outpacing new arrivals, or rent increases are flattening, you might be walking into a bubble. And bubbles don't burst loudly. They deflate slowly-while your returns shrink and your risk rises.\n\nI’ve seen people stretch their budgets to buy in buzzy zip codes, only to watch values stagnate while their projected ROI disappears. They weren’t wrong to like the city. They were just late-and under-informed.\n\nIn 2025, a smart investor isn’t chasing the loudest market. They’re digging into the fundamentals: population growth, job creation, supply vs. demand, rent trends, and landlord laws. Because if those aren’t solid, the hype is just noise.\n\n**Ignoring local legislation, rent control, or property tax hikes**\n\nIt doesn’t matter how great the neighborhood looks on paper-if the local laws are hostile to landlords, your returns will suffer.\n\nToo many investors in 2025 are skipping this research step. They run the numbers, love the cap rate, and close the deal… only to find out two months later that their city just passed a rent control measure that freezes rent hikes. Or a new property tax assessment adds $3,000 a year to their costs. Or an eviction moratorium means they’re stuck with a non-paying tenant for half a year.\n\nThis isn’t theory-it’s happening. In places like Minneapolis, strict rent caps are already making investors second-guess long-term plays. In New Jersey, tax reassessments have blindsided landlords who assumed their holding costs were fixed.\n\nBeing a landlord in 2025 means knowing the legislation at the city and county level-not just the state. Because one bad ordinance can turn a great property into a money pit.\n\n**Underestimating vacancy risk or overbuilt housing supply**\n\nCash flow models look great-until the unit sits vacant for three months.\n\nVacancy risk is the silent killer of ROI. And in 2025, it’s not just happening in small towns. Overbuilt suburbs, new condo developments, and cities with unbalanced supply-demand ratios are all seeing longer-than-average listing times and sharper rental concessions.\n\nA classic example? Parts of downtown Miami. Luxury rentals have flooded the market, and even in high-demand areas, landlords are offering free months just to fill units. If you didn’t budget for a 10% vacancy rate-or thought your unit would stay full year-round-you’re already losing.\n\nVacancy isn’t just about tenant turnover. It’s about understanding who your renter is, how much competition you’re facing, and what happens when new inventory hits your neighborhood six months after you buy.\n\nGreat investors in 2025 aren’t just asking “How much can I make?” They’re asking, “How long will it take to make anything if this sits empty?”\n\n**Failing to research tenant demand or seasonal market shifts**\n\nReal estate isn’t static. Some cities spike in summer and slow down in winter. College towns may go vacant for months between semesters. Resort towns might crush short-term income during peak season but leave you dry during off months. If you don’t know your market’s seasonal flow, you're not managing risk-you’re ignoring it.\n\nToo many new investors assume demand is consistent. They see average rent prices and think that number applies 12 months a year. It doesn’t. Tenant demand moves with the school year, the job cycle, and even the weather. And missing those patterns means empty units, underpriced listings, or costly vacancy gaps.\n\nIn 2025, tools like AirDNA, Redfin’s rental insights, and local leasing agents can give you real-time data on tenant behavior. Ignoring that info is like flying blind in turbulence.\n\nAnd here's the thing-some of the most profitable cities have intense seasonality. That’s not a dealbreaker. But it *is* something to plan around. Because a profitable rental in March that sits empty in November still hurts your annual return.\n\n***^(Book Insight: In The Book on Managing Rental Properties by Heather and Brandon Turner (Chapter 8), the authors break down how smart property management starts with market knowledge-especially tenant behavior, legal changes, and vacancy risk. Most mistakes in real estate aren’t property problems. They’re location misunderstandings.)***\n\n\n\n# FAQ\n\n**What is the #1 city to invest in real estate in 2025?**\n\nThere’s no single “best” city for every investor-but if you’re looking at the full package of population growth, rent demand, affordability, and long-term upside, **Tampa, Florida** is at the top of the list in 2025.\n\nThe city is pulling in remote workers from the Northeast and Midwest, the rental market is tight, and property values are climbing steadily without the speculative chaos you see in other Sun Belt cities. It’s not the cheapest, but it’s one of the few metros where both cash flow and appreciation are still on the table.\n\nThat said, **Raleigh, North Carolina** and **Huntsville, Alabama** are right behind. Both offer investor-friendly legislation, expanding job markets, and neighborhoods that are still undervalued. If you’re in it for long-term growth with lower entry costs, they’re hard to beat.\n\nThe best city for *you* depends on your strategy. Cash flow? Go Midwest. Appreciation? Head Southeast. Remote management? Stick with landlord-friendly laws and stable tenant pools. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer-but Tampa’s fundamentals are tough to argue with.\n\n**How do I know if a city is a good real estate market?**\n\nThe best real estate markets aren’t defined by hype-they’re built on data.\n\nStart with five things: job growth, population growth, rental demand, housing affordability, and landlord laws. If a city checks all five boxes, it’s worth a closer look. If it misses more than one, it’s probably not ready for your money.\n\nCheck the U.S. Census for migration data. Use Redfin to track days on market and inventory levels. Look at platforms like Roofstock and Mashvisor to dig into rental yield and neighborhood performance. And always, always research local landlord laws-because one bad ordinance can flip your ROI upside down.\n\nReal estate investing isn’t just about liking a city. It’s about proving that the numbers work-and that they’ll keep working five years from now.\n\n**Are big cities or smaller metros better for real estate in 2025?**\n\nIn 2025, **smaller metros are delivering better returns** than big cities. Full stop.\n\nHere’s why: smaller markets like Chattanooga, Des Moines, and Fayetteville still have room to grow. They offer lower purchase prices, higher rent-to-price ratios, and less competition from institutional investors. That means better margins, easier entry, and more flexible exit options.\n\nBig cities like LA or NYC might feel “safer,” but most are overpriced, overregulated, and over-leveraged. Unless you’re playing with multi-million-dollar capital and aiming for luxury flips or REIT-level commercial plays, they’re not built for small-to-medium investors anymore.\n\nSmaller doesn’t mean riskier. It means more agile, more profitable, and-right now-more aligned with how Americans are actually choosing to live.\n\n**What tech tools help choose the right investment market?**\n\nIn 2025, the tools you use are as important as the market you pick.\n\nStart with **Mashvisor** to compare city-level rental returns, Airbnb data, and cash flow projections. It’s one of the only platforms that merges long-term and short-term analysis into one interface-and that saves time.\n\nUse **Zillow** to understand pricing trends and neighborhood-level appreciation rates. And don’t sleep on **Redfin**, especially for its migration maps and average rent growth charts. These tools aren’t perfect, but they give you an investor’s version of X-ray vision.\n\nIf you’re getting serious, layer in **PropStream** or **Reventure** for hyper-local insights: pre-foreclosure data, zoning overlays, and construction pipeline forecasts. The deeper you go, the more obvious it becomes which cities are trending *up*\\-and which are already saturated.\n\nIn short: great investors aren’t guessing anymore. They’re stacking tools, running the math, and moving fast when the numbers line up.\n\n**Can I invest remotely in top real estate markets?**\n\nYes-**remote investing is not just possible in 2025, it’s normal**.\n\nWhether you're in New York buying in Tulsa, or based in LA and targeting Huntsville, there’s an entire ecosystem designed to support you. Virtual showings, digital notarization, remote-friendly lenders, and turnkey property management companies make it doable-and scalable.\n\nThe key is your team. A bad property manager can ruin a great property. A strong local agent can flag red flags before they cost you thousands. So treat your out-of-state market like a startup: assemble the right people first, then deploy capital with confidence.\n\nRemote investing works. But only if your systems are tighter than your zip code.\n\n*Book Insight: In Long-Distance Real Estate Investing by David Greene (Chapter 4), he breaks down exactly how to build a local team, vet markets remotely, and protect yourself from the most common out-of-state mistakes.

In 2025, it’s not just about buying in “hot” cities. It&amp;#39;s about reading the map behind the map: where people are moving, where jobs are being created, and where demand is climbing but prices haven’t caught up yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old rules of investing-just buy in a big city and wait-don’t work anymore. That model broke when mortgage rates spiked in 2023 and shook the foundation of urban real estate. What emerged instead is a new ecosystem of overlooked cities with insane upside. The smart investors saw it early. Others are just catching up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’re a first-time buyer trying to escape rising rent. Maybe you’ve got your eye on your first cash-flow property. Or maybe you’re just done watching everyone else win while your savings sit flat. Whatever your reason, this guide breaks down the cities where your investment in 2025 isn’t just safe-it has serious room to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;High-Performing U.S. Cities for Real Estate Investment in 2025&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which U.S. cities are projected to deliver the highest ROI in 2025?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re chasing real returns-not just pretty properties-then you&amp;#39;re going to want to look beyond the obvious markets. The cities poised to deliver the strongest ROI in 2025 have one thing in common: they’ve quietly balanced affordability with rising rental demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take Tampa, Florida. It’s no longer just a vacation spot. The city has become a magnet for remote workers ditching expensive metros like New York and Boston. Rents have climbed faster than national averages, but entry prices still give investors breathing room. The cash-on-cash returns here are real, and they’re backed by steady population growth-not speculative hype.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cleveland, Ohio might not sound sexy, but that’s the point. Investors who bought duplexes here two years ago are already sitting on cap rates that beat most Sun Belt cities. Low property taxes, a growing healthcare economy, and neighborhood revitalization have made this one of the Midwest’s most under-the-radar stars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there’s Raleigh, North Carolina. With Apple expanding its campus and Google doubling down on its presence in the Research Triangle, the tech energy is strong and sticky. Home prices are climbing, but not too fast. Demand is rising, but not volatile. It&amp;#39;s the kind of stability investors crave-without giving up appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These cities aren’t buzzy. They’re balanced. And that’s where the highest ROI lives in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top real estate markets driven by population growth and employment surges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re wondering where to put your money, follow the people. Population growth and job creation are the two biggest engines behind real estate returns, and in 2025, they’re reshaping the investment landscape in some surprising ways.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Boise, Idaho is one of them. What started as a trickle of California relocations has turned into a steady stream of families and young professionals looking for space, nature, and sanity. With tech-adjacent jobs popping up in the downtown core and a development boom along I-84, demand isn’t slowing anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Huntsville, Alabama is another unexpected gem. This city is no longer just a government outpost-it’s a full-blown aerospace hub. Engineers, defense contractors, and remote tech workers are all converging here, and the rental market has taken off accordingly. Prices remain investor-friendly, but rents are rising fast, which makes the math work for long-term yield.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Austin, Texas-despite its sky-high growth during the pandemic-has found its second wind. While prices cooled in 2023, the arrival of clean tech companies and semiconductor factories has brought new life to its outer suburbs. Investors who were priced out two years ago are now finding sweet spots with strong fundamentals and room for appreciation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Where jobs go, demand follows. And where demand outpaces supply, that’s where you’ll find opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best cities for appreciation: Where home values are accelerating fastest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real estate appreciation isn’t about getting lucky. It’s about spotting trends before they show up in the headlines. And in 2025, the fastest appreciation isn’t happening in coastal metros-it’s happening in places building quietly, steadily, and smartly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Indianapolis, Indiana is leading the charge. Home values here jumped nearly ten percent year-over-year, thanks to massive investment in logistics infrastructure and a housing market that’s still shockingly affordable by national standards. Investors who bought pre-2024 are already seeing impressive equity growth-and there&amp;#39;s still room to run.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Columbus, Ohio is having a moment too. Intel’s $20 billion chip plant has created a ripple effect across the city. Suburban neighborhoods once overlooked are now seeing bidding wars, and rent growth is following closely behind. The appreciation here isn’t hype-it’s tied to actual jobs, actual development, and actual demand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Charlotte, North Carolina continues to deliver that rare combo of steady growth and livable affordability. While it’s grown consistently over the past decade, it’s avoided the boom-bust cycle. Investors love Charlotte because it doesn’t crash-it just climbs, slowly and surely. And in 2025, that kind of consistency is gold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cities with the strongest appreciation aren’t always the flashiest. They’re the ones that are quietly building futures people actually want to live in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which metros are balancing affordability and demand in 2025?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the holy grail for any real estate investor: a city that’s not too expensive to buy into, but has strong, steady rental demand. In 2025, those sweet-spot cities are getting harder to find-but they still exist if you know where to look.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Greenville, South Carolina is one of them. Its cost of living remains low, but the city has built out its downtown, attracted a surprising number of remote workers, and is experiencing consistent rent growth without pricing people out. It feels livable, and that’s translating into long-term tenants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Des Moines, Iowa is another strong contender. It’s easy to overlook the Midwest, but that’s where a lot of the quiet growth is happening. Insurance and tech-adjacent jobs are bringing stability to the local economy, while housing remains well within reach for both buyers and renters. Vacancy rates are low, and turnover is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there’s Fayetteville, Arkansas-a city most people know as the home of Walmart HQ. What they don’t see is the startup ecosystem that’s growing around that massive retail engine. With every supply chain innovation comes new jobs, new demand, and pressure on a housing market that hasn’t fully caught up yet. For investors, that’s prime territory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These metros aren’t just affordable. They’re sticky. People move in and stay. And that stickiness is what makes real estate investments here sustainable-not just in 2025, but for the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Book Insight: In The Millionaire Real Estate Investor by Gary Keller (Chapter 6&lt;/sup&gt;, there’s a powerful idea: the best investments aren’t about chasing headlines-they’re about recognizing when a city’s fundamentals support both cash flow and appreciation. The cities above aren’t guesses. They’re aligned with everything that builds long-term wealth.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Best Cities for Rental Property Cash Flow in 2025&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which cities offer the strongest cap rates for rental investors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cash flow is the part most people forget when they glamorize real estate. Appreciation gets all the attention, but it&amp;#39;s rental income-the month-to-month, mortgage-covering, freedom-funding flow-that separates surviving from thriving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the strongest cap rates aren&amp;#39;t in New York or Los Angeles. They&amp;#39;re in places like Buffalo, Memphis, and Pittsburgh-cities that don’t trend on social media but quietly outperform quarter after quarter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Buffalo is back on investor radars, not because it’s flashy, but because the math checks out. Low property prices combined with solid rent yields mean you’re often clearing 7–9% cap rates, even after property management fees. Renters here aren’t transient; they stay. That stability translates into reliable returns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Memphis has long been a cash-flow favorite, but 2025 is giving it new life. The logistics and warehouse boom has put consistent pressure on rental housing near industrial zones. Investors are locking in duplexes and triplexes that generate positive cash flow from day one-without exotic financing tricks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh, once written off as post-industrial, is now building a new story through healthcare, AI research, and robotics. What that means for you: more job-seeking renters, and a surprising number of turnkey properties under $150,000 that cash flow better than anything on the coasts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If appreciation is a maybe, cash flow is the now. And these cities deliver both without asking you to gamble.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affordable housing markets with high rent-to-price ratios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most misunderstood metric in real estate is the rent-to-price ratio. It’s the quiet indicator that tells you whether your investment is likely to work. In short, if the monthly rent covers-or exceeds-your ownership costs, you’re in a good place. And in 2025, that ratio looks best in cities where homes are still priced under the national median but rents are catching up fast.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take Little Rock, Arkansas. You can still buy single-family homes under $170,000, while average rents have climbed past $1,200. That puts you in the cash-flow sweet spot, where one tenant covers your mortgage and expenses with margin to spare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cincinnati is another market worth watching. The downtown revitalization and steady employment growth have pushed rents up, but property values haven’t inflated at the same pace. That gap is your gain as an investor. Strong tenant demand, paired with low competition from institutional buyers, keeps the door open for everyday investors to win here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there&amp;#39;s Birmingham, Alabama-a market that blends affordability with upward pressure. Construction is limited, zoning is favorable, and the rent-to-price ratio remains one of the strongest in the Southeast. When every dollar counts, ratios like these protect your investment from volatility.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rent-to-price is more than a stat. It’s a signal. And if you’re not reading it, you&amp;#39;re already behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are tenants staying longer: Low vacancy, high retention markets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A city might have great cash flow on paper, but if your tenants move out every year-or worse, leave you with vacancies-you’re stuck burning through your profit on turnover costs and lost rent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That’s why, in 2025, long-term investor success is increasingly tied to tenant retention. Cities with stable economies, livable amenities, and low crime tend to keep renters longer. And longer stays mean stronger returns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wichita, Kansas is quietly winning on this front. Its cost of living makes it attractive to remote workers and families, while its housing stock skews toward single-family homes that tenants treat like their own. Investors report high lease renewals and minimal vacancy gaps, even in off-seasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chattanooga, Tennessee is seeing similar behavior. The city’s outdoor lifestyle, low taxes, and tech-friendly culture are drawing in young renters who settle down longer than expected. Turnover is low, and property owners have been able to raise rents incrementally without losing quality tenants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These aren’t just “cash flow” cities-they’re &lt;strong&gt;stable&lt;/strong&gt; cash flow cities. That’s what matters when you’re playing the long game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top cities for short-term rentals (Airbnb/STR) vs. long-term leases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not every market rewards the same strategy. In some cities, Airbnb income far exceeds what you’d make from a traditional tenant. In others, regulation makes short-term rentals risky or outright illegal. In 2025, the key is knowing which cities support which model-and investing accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking at short-term rentals, Asheville, North Carolina is a front-runner. The mix of tourism, nature, and boutique appeal makes it one of the highest-performing Airbnb markets in the U.S. Nightly rates are high, bookings are consistent, and regulations remain manageable with the right licensing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, long-term leases are dominating in cities like Oklahoma City. With a growing aerospace economy and new urban housing incentives, investors are locking in stable, year-round tenants with zero Airbnb drama. The leases might not look glamorous, but they’re predictable-and they don’t come with seasonal dips.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Savvy investors in 2025 are building mixed portfolios: one market for short-term gains, another for long-term consistency. It’s not about being flashy. It’s about being free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Book Insight: In Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat (BRRRR&lt;/sup&gt; by David Greene (Chapter 7), he breaks down how different strategies succeed in different markets-and why understanding local demand, not national hype, is what separates amateur landlords from portfolio builders.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Secondary &amp;amp; Mid-Sized Cities Gaining Investor Momentum&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why secondary markets are outperforming major metros in 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re still only watching LA, New York, or San Francisco, you&amp;#39;re missing where the smart money is actually going. In 2025, real estate investors aren’t pouring capital into big cities-they&amp;#39;re pulling it out and moving into secondary markets that offer more value, more yield, and way fewer headaches.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The shift started quietly during the remote work boom. People realized they didn’t need to live in expensive, crowded metros to earn good money. That change hasn’t just stuck-it’s evolved. Now, cities that used to be “flyover country” are driving real returns while the old favorites struggle with overpricing, regulation, and stagnant rents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about it. In places like San Jose, property taxes are brutal, rent control laws are tightening, and cash flow is nearly impossible to achieve without seven-figure down payments. Meanwhile, smaller metros are offering 8% cap rates, low competition, and better tenant retention. That’s not just a trend-it’s a strategic realignment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Investors in 2025 are chasing ROI, not reputation. That’s why secondary markets are winning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top 5 emerging cities for long-term appreciation and yield&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When you zoom in on where momentum is building, a few cities keep showing up-not on glossy headlines, but in spreadsheets, investor meetups, and smart portfolio breakdowns. These aren’t guesses. These are markets with real growth engines and runway left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spokane, Washington has seen a wave of younger buyers and remote workers fleeing Seattle’s high costs. The demand has triggered appreciation, but prices haven’t yet hit their peak. Investors are locking in properties at prices that feel like Portland did a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lancaster, Pennsylvania is another one most people overlook. But dig a little deeper, and you&amp;#39;ll see a city with growing healthcare jobs, strong local colleges, and a rental market that’s tight enough to give landlords leverage. The yields are surprisingly strong, especially for duplex and triplex investors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tulsa, Oklahoma launched its “remote worker grant” back in the day-and it paid off. The downtown has been revitalized, job opportunities are expanding, and housing is still affordable. That combo makes it a killer setup for both cash flow and long-term value growth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bozeman, Montana might not have the volume of other cities, but it has one thing investors love: scarcity. Land is limited, demand is high, and rents are pushing up fast. It’s not a cash flow play today, but for appreciation over the next ten years, Bozeman is quietly becoming one to watch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there’s Lexington, Kentucky. The bourbon industry, local tech expansion, and steady university demand create a resilient ecosystem that isn’t overexposed. Investors here aren’t just riding a wave-they’re part of a grounded, growing market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key in all five of these cities isn’t hype-it’s fundamentals. They’re growing because of real reasons, and that growth hasn’t priced out opportunity yet. That’s exactly where you want to be as an investor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How remote work and lifestyle migration are reshaping investment maps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old idea of “location, location, location” meant something very different before Zoom, hybrid teams, and digital-first startups rewrote the rules of where people live. In 2025, people don’t move just for work-they move for quality of life. And that’s changing the investment map in real time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cities with bikeable downtowns, fast internet, walkable neighborhoods, and good coffee have become magnets for the type of tenants landlords dream about: stable income, longer leases, and willingness to pay for comfort. But here’s the twist-these aren’t traditional metros. They’re lifestyle-first cities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Places like Missoula, Montana or Asheville, North Carolina don’t have massive job centers, but they’re building communities that attract remote workers with disposable income. And when high-income renters arrive, demand pushes rents up. That’s where your margins grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, traditional “job first” metros are getting squeezed. Commute patterns have changed. Office occupancy is still low. And in some markets, that’s softened demand for urban rentals entirely. Investors who adapt to these new migration patterns are staying ahead. Those who don’t are chasing yesterday’s returns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lifestyle migration isn’t a phase-it’s a new baseline. And real estate investors who learn to follow quality of life, not just paychecks, are finding the kind of growth that lasts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Book Insight: In Set for Life by Scott Trench (Chapter 5&lt;/sup&gt;, he makes it clear: real wealth in real estate comes not just from good properties, but from picking the right neighborhoods before everyone else sees the value. That’s exactly what these emerging and mid-sized markets offer in 2025.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Economic Drivers Powering the Top Real Estate Markets&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How infrastructure projects and economic development zones affect property values&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real estate doesn’t rise in a vacuum. It rises with roads, rails, broadband, airports, and zoning changes. And in 2025, infrastructure isn’t just a policy headline-it’s a direct investment signal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When a city secures funding for a major transit expansion or airport upgrade, it triggers something bigger than convenience. It reshapes the entire value chain of the surrounding neighborhoods. Suddenly, properties within a 10-minute walk from a future light rail station go from average to prime. Investors who catch that early? They don’t just win-they compound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Look at Phoenix. The $1 billion South Central Light Rail Extension, now nearing completion, has already started pushing property values up along the planned stops. Neighborhoods once considered “up and coming” are already trading at 25–30% higher than just three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Or take Richmond, Virginia, where federal Opportunity Zones are turning overlooked blocks into construction sites. The capital flow into those zones isn’t just tax-driven-it’s transformation-driven. Coffee shops follow. Then co-working spaces. Then high-income renters. That’s the real game.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure signals where the money is going next. When you invest alongside that movement, your upside isn’t just luck-it’s baked into the street grid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which cities are attracting major corporate relocations and startups?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time a Fortune 500 company opens a new headquarters or a major startup moves its base, there’s a ripple effect. Jobs spike. Salaries climb. People move in. And housing? Housing becomes the bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2025, cities that are landing these deals are climbing investor shortlists fast. One of the biggest winners this year is Nashville, Tennessee. Oracle, Amazon, and multiple fintech startups are turning the city into a Southern tech corridor. With every relocation, demand for rental housing explodes-especially in neighborhoods near transit and amenities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there’s Reno, Nevada. What used to be a sleepy alternative to Vegas is now a logistics and EV manufacturing hotspot. Tesla’s Gigafactory expansion is just the beginning. The ripple includes suppliers, transport jobs, and white-collar engineers-all looking for housing that doesn’t exist yet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even smaller cities like Provo, Utah are in the game. With BYU alumni founding startups and a state government that openly courts tech employers, the city’s job base is growing faster than its housing inventory. That imbalance is opportunity-for those who can spot it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Corporate relocations create rental demand, drive appreciation, and shift economic gravity. Miss the company, and you miss the market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of cost of living, tax policies, and business incentives on housing growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most real estate guides talk about price-but not price &lt;em&gt;relative to income&lt;/em&gt;. And that’s where cost of living matters. When people can afford to live well and still save, they move there. When companies can avoid high payroll taxes and regulation, they relocate too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t abstract. In 2025, it’s directly fueling migration into states like Texas, Florida, and Tennessee. These places offer low or no state income taxes, affordable housing relative to wages, and city governments that welcome development. For investors, that creates a triple win: incoming population, rising demand, and business-friendly laws that don’t crush your returns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take Jacksonville, Florida. It&amp;#39;s not just a cheaper Miami-it’s a self-contained economy with healthcare, finance, and logistics sectors that are all hiring. The city’s tax structure and business incentives make it one of the most landlord-friendly metros in the country right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with Chicago, where escalating property taxes and regulation have started to squeeze landlords. Even though rents are high, net returns are shrinking. The cash flow story doesn’t work if the city keeps eating into your margins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tax policy and cost of living aren’t side notes-they&amp;#39;re core parts of the investment math. And in 2025, they’re determining which markets grow and which ones stall out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long-term growth outlook based on local GDP and housing starts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to know whether a city will be worth investing in ten years from now, don’t just look at comps-look at GDP growth and housing starts. A rising local GDP signals economic expansion, job creation, and wage increases. Housing starts tell you whether supply is keeping up with that demand-or falling behind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Boise, local GDP has grown over 4% annually since 2020, and the city still can’t build houses fast enough. That gap between economic growth and housing inventory is why property values are appreciating so quickly-and why rents keep rising.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In contrast, cities like St. Louis have seen slower GDP growth and declining new construction. That’s not always a deal-breaker, but it means returns will rely more on timing and property-specific plays, not macro lift.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Austin continues to be the poster child for this. Even after a cooldown in 2023, its GDP growth remains strong, and housing starts are being outpaced by demand from tech and clean energy. That’s a recipe for long-term upward pressure-both on rents and values.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Investors who watch macro trends don’t get blindsided. They get ahead. And in a market where everyone’s fighting for an edge, knowing how to read GDP and housing starts might be the most underrated skill of all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Book Insight: In Mastering the Market Cycle by Howard Marks (Chapter 9&lt;/sup&gt;, he explains that long-term investing success comes from reading the broader environment-not just individual deals. Property values follow economics, not the other way around. And in 2025, your edge comes from understanding the city’s future before everyone else does.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tools &amp;amp; Technology for Evaluating the Best Cities to Invest In&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best platforms for researching real estate markets in 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2025, if you&amp;#39;re still picking real estate markets based on word of mouth or a Reddit thread, you’re gambling-not investing. The best investors now rely on data-first platforms that strip the guesswork out of city selection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mashvisor remains a go-to for a reason. It doesn’t just show you listings-it calculates rental income projections, Airbnb occupancy rates, and neighborhood-level cash-on-cash returns. If you&amp;#39;re trying to decide between a two-bed in Fort Worth or a duplex in Knoxville, this is where you start.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then there’s Roofstock, which has become a game changer for remote investors. Its marketplace filters turnkey rentals by ROI, neighborhood rating, and price-to-rent ratio, giving you a clean dashboard to compare cities across the U.S. It’s not hype-just numbers, returns, and properties you can buy with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For deeper, more economic-focused research, investors are using NeighborhoodScout and the U.S. Census Housing Dashboard. They offer everything from crime trends to school ratings and migration flows. It’s not sexy, but it’s essential. Because where people are going-especially in big numbers-is where your money should go too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The right platform doesn’t just help you pick a city. It helps you avoid the wrong one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using AI and predictive analytics to compare city-level investment data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The old way to analyze a real estate market was a mix of spreadsheets, intuition, and a prayer. The new way? Machine learning, predictive analytics, and real-time trend forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2025, investors are plugging into AI tools that forecast rent growth, estimate neighborhood gentrification timelines, and even predict cap rate changes based on zoning proposals and infrastructure plans. This isn’t science fiction-it’s happening right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For example, some investors are feeding public housing permit data and migration patterns into custom-built dashboards using tools like Tableau and Power BI. The goal? Spot early signs of rising demand before the market reacts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Others are using machine learning APIs from providers like Tern Analytics to compare 100+ U.S. cities by rental yield, turnover risk, and job market volatility. It&amp;#39;s not about replacing instincts-it&amp;#39;s about backing them with insight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Predictive analytics won’t buy your property for you. But it will show you which cities are about to break out-before your competitors even log in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free vs. premium tools for market scouting and rental analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk cost. Because not everyone can drop $100/month on pro dashboards-and you honestly don’t need to.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For free tools, Zillow still leads the pack for baseline pricing data, neighborhood trends, and property comps. Redfin adds solid on-market stats like sale-to-list ratios and median days on market. Pair the two, and you can cover the basics of almost any city.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;AirDNA offers free insights on Airbnb trends like nightly rate and occupancy, though deeper reports require a paid account. Even a trial version can give you a pulse on whether short-term rental demand is growing-or dying-in a target market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you’re investing more than $250K, premium tools start paying for themselves fast. Platforms like PropStream and REIPro give detailed owner history, equity status, and lien reports that surface hidden opportunities. You&amp;#39;re not just buying access-you&amp;#39;re buying speed and clarity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The truth is, whether you&amp;#39;re bootstrapping or buying big, there’s a tech stack for you. The real mistake? Flying blind when tools this good are one login away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zillow, Mashvisor, and Redfin: How investors leverage real-time dashboards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to browse listings. It’s another to actively track market behavior in real time-and that’s where dashboards come in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Investors serious about 2025 results are using Zillow’s market-level trends to monitor average list prices, rental vacancy shifts, and even buyer competition scores. That insight helps you time your entry-and avoid paying peak prices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Mashvisor, dashboards let you rank entire zip codes by rental yield, cash-on-cash return, and Airbnb potential. For someone comparing Indianapolis to Columbus, this view offers the edge. It transforms gut feeling into measurable advantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Redfin adds an underrated weapon: the migration tracker. You can literally see where people are moving from and to, month over month. If Atlanta is gaining thousands of new residents from LA and Chicago, that’s not noise-it’s your signal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2025, real estate is a data game. And dashboards are your cheat code. Not because they remove all risk-but because they let you act smarter, faster, and earlier than anyone else in the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Book Insight: In The Book on Rental Property Investing by Brandon Turner (Chapter 12&lt;/sup&gt;, he emphasizes how great investors build systems-tools that let them analyze faster, act quicker, and track markets in real time. Your tech stack isn’t optional. It’s your edge.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Mistakes to Avoid When Choosing a Real Estate Market&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overpaying in hot markets without stable fundamentals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every year, a new city becomes the darling of real estate TikTok. In 2021 it was Austin. Then it was Boise. In 2023, it was Nashville. These markets get hyped fast-and often for good reason. But in 2025, too many investors are still confusing “popular” with “profitable.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The most common trap? Buying at the top of a market cycle without understanding what’s driving demand. If job growth is slowing, construction is outpacing new arrivals, or rent increases are flattening, you might be walking into a bubble. And bubbles don&amp;#39;t burst loudly. They deflate slowly-while your returns shrink and your risk rises.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen people stretch their budgets to buy in buzzy zip codes, only to watch values stagnate while their projected ROI disappears. They weren’t wrong to like the city. They were just late-and under-informed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2025, a smart investor isn’t chasing the loudest market. They’re digging into the fundamentals: population growth, job creation, supply vs. demand, rent trends, and landlord laws. Because if those aren’t solid, the hype is just noise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring local legislation, rent control, or property tax hikes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t matter how great the neighborhood looks on paper-if the local laws are hostile to landlords, your returns will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too many investors in 2025 are skipping this research step. They run the numbers, love the cap rate, and close the deal… only to find out two months later that their city just passed a rent control measure that freezes rent hikes. Or a new property tax assessment adds $3,000 a year to their costs. Or an eviction moratorium means they’re stuck with a non-paying tenant for half a year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn’t theory-it’s happening. In places like Minneapolis, strict rent caps are already making investors second-guess long-term plays. In New Jersey, tax reassessments have blindsided landlords who assumed their holding costs were fixed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a landlord in 2025 means knowing the legislation at the city and county level-not just the state. Because one bad ordinance can turn a great property into a money pit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underestimating vacancy risk or overbuilt housing supply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cash flow models look great-until the unit sits vacant for three months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vacancy risk is the silent killer of ROI. And in 2025, it’s not just happening in small towns. Overbuilt suburbs, new condo developments, and cities with unbalanced supply-demand ratios are all seeing longer-than-average listing times and sharper rental concessions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A classic example? Parts of downtown Miami. Luxury rentals have flooded the market, and even in high-demand areas, landlords are offering free months just to fill units. If you didn’t budget for a 10% vacancy rate-or thought your unit would stay full year-round-you’re already losing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Vacancy isn’t just about tenant turnover. It’s about understanding who your renter is, how much competition you’re facing, and what happens when new inventory hits your neighborhood six months after you buy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Great investors in 2025 aren’t just asking “How much can I make?” They’re asking, “How long will it take to make anything if this sits empty?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failing to research tenant demand or seasonal market shifts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real estate isn’t static. Some cities spike in summer and slow down in winter. College towns may go vacant for months between semesters. Resort towns might crush short-term income during peak season but leave you dry during off months. If you don’t know your market’s seasonal flow, you&amp;#39;re not managing risk-you’re ignoring it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Too many new investors assume demand is consistent. They see average rent prices and think that number applies 12 months a year. It doesn’t. Tenant demand moves with the school year, the job cycle, and even the weather. And missing those patterns means empty units, underpriced listings, or costly vacancy gaps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2025, tools like AirDNA, Redfin’s rental insights, and local leasing agents can give you real-time data on tenant behavior. Ignoring that info is like flying blind in turbulence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s the thing-some of the most profitable cities have intense seasonality. That’s not a dealbreaker. But it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; something to plan around. Because a profitable rental in March that sits empty in November still hurts your annual return.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Book Insight: In The Book on Managing Rental Properties by Heather and Brandon Turner (Chapter 8&lt;/sup&gt;, the authors break down how smart property management starts with market knowledge-especially tenant behavior, legal changes, and vacancy risk. Most mistakes in real estate aren’t property problems. They’re location misunderstandings.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;FAQ&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the #1 city to invest in real estate in 2025?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There’s no single “best” city for every investor-but if you’re looking at the full package of population growth, rent demand, affordability, and long-term upside, &lt;strong&gt;Tampa, Florida&lt;/strong&gt; is at the top of the list in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The city is pulling in remote workers from the Northeast and Midwest, the rental market is tight, and property values are climbing steadily without the speculative chaos you see in other Sun Belt cities. It’s not the cheapest, but it’s one of the few metros where both cash flow and appreciation are still on the table.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That said, &lt;strong&gt;Raleigh, North Carolina&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Huntsville, Alabama&lt;/strong&gt; are right behind. Both offer investor-friendly legislation, expanding job markets, and neighborhoods that are still undervalued. If you’re in it for long-term growth with lower entry costs, they’re hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best city for &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; depends on your strategy. Cash flow? Go Midwest. Appreciation? Head Southeast. Remote management? Stick with landlord-friendly laws and stable tenant pools. There’s no one-size-fits-all answer-but Tampa’s fundamentals are tough to argue with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I know if a city is a good real estate market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best real estate markets aren’t defined by hype-they’re built on data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start with five things: job growth, population growth, rental demand, housing affordability, and landlord laws. If a city checks all five boxes, it’s worth a closer look. If it misses more than one, it’s probably not ready for your money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check the U.S. Census for migration data. Use Redfin to track days on market and inventory levels. Look at platforms like Roofstock and Mashvisor to dig into rental yield and neighborhood performance. And always, always research local landlord laws-because one bad ordinance can flip your ROI upside down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Real estate investing isn’t just about liking a city. It’s about proving that the numbers work-and that they’ll keep working five years from now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are big cities or smaller metros better for real estate in 2025?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2025, &lt;strong&gt;smaller metros are delivering better returns&lt;/strong&gt; than big cities. Full stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here’s why: smaller markets like Chattanooga, Des Moines, and Fayetteville still have room to grow. They offer lower purchase prices, higher rent-to-price ratios, and less competition from institutional investors. That means better margins, easier entry, and more flexible exit options.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big cities like LA or NYC might feel “safer,” but most are overpriced, overregulated, and over-leveraged. Unless you’re playing with multi-million-dollar capital and aiming for luxury flips or REIT-level commercial plays, they’re not built for small-to-medium investors anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smaller doesn’t mean riskier. It means more agile, more profitable, and-right now-more aligned with how Americans are actually choosing to live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What tech tools help choose the right investment market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the tools you use are as important as the market you pick.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start with &lt;strong&gt;Mashvisor&lt;/strong&gt; to compare city-level rental returns, Airbnb data, and cash flow projections. It’s one of the only platforms that merges long-term and short-term analysis into one interface-and that saves time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;Zillow&lt;/strong&gt; to understand pricing trends and neighborhood-level appreciation rates. And don’t sleep on &lt;strong&gt;Redfin&lt;/strong&gt;, especially for its migration maps and average rent growth charts. These tools aren’t perfect, but they give you an investor’s version of X-ray vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re getting serious, layer in &lt;strong&gt;PropStream&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Reventure&lt;/strong&gt; for hyper-local insights: pre-foreclosure data, zoning overlays, and construction pipeline forecasts. The deeper you go, the more obvious it becomes which cities are trending &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;-and which are already saturated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In short: great investors aren’t guessing anymore. They’re stacking tools, running the math, and moving fast when the numbers line up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I invest remotely in top real estate markets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes-&lt;strong&gt;remote investing is not just possible in 2025, it’s normal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;#39;re in New York buying in Tulsa, or based in LA and targeting Huntsville, there’s an entire ecosystem designed to support you. Virtual showings, digital notarization, remote-friendly lenders, and turnkey property management companies make it doable-and scalable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The key is your team. A bad property manager can ruin a great property. A strong local agent can flag red flags before they cost you thousands. So treat your out-of-state market like a startup: assemble the right people first, then deploy capital with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Remote investing works. But only if your systems are tighter than your zip code.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Book Insight: In Long-Distance Real Estate Investing by David Greene (Chapter 4), he breaks down exactly how to build a local team, vet markets remotely, and protect yourself from the most common out-of-state mistakes. The most important line? “It’s not about the market-it’s about your process.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

OBSES - Tired of: [NËU]**  \n*Recommended if you like: Sleepnet, IMANU, Maysev*  \n\nThrough this format, I've come across oh so many new, sometimes pretty exciting names, but rarely has a completely new name blown me away as much as **NËU**'s nëwest outstanding finding **OBSES** has. \n\n**1.1. Law-abiding Virtualchemist**  \n\nOf course, that means there's more to his music journey than just the few releases you can see on the Spotify page, you've hopefully learned as much from the countless examples I've given over the years. So what else is there, then? Well, the first signs of online activity I can find of **Noa Choukroun**, the Frenchie behind it all, points to an alias he established in 2019: **Virtual Law**! Sometimes also written as _The_ Virtual Law, this alias was Noa's outlet for the sounds of Progressive Trance (my phone wanted to autocorrect this to _Progressive France_), Psy-france, and Melodic Techno, first on his very own Soundcloud, but later also on labels like _NBM_, _Blue Tunes_ and _Red Tunes_. As the world opened up a bit again after the first waves of the pandemic, you could see Noa practising his Virtual Law live at DIEZE Warehouse and Le Bikini, among other places. However, it wasn't always all fun and Trance, Noa also sneaked a couple _Noisia_, _The Caracal Project_, _Fade Black_ and even _Dimension_ tunes into his sets here and there, and by 2023, the D and the B had fully taken over, to the point of **OBSES**sion. \n\nStarting with his self-released, uniquely-titled explorations of the expertly technical and futuristically melodic, from post-seperation emotional journey _I just broke up, lol._ to procrastination anthem _chill, imma start tomorrow_. Shortly after, in summer of 2024, Noa's shouckingly good debut double single on the ever-incredible **NËU** made the rounds. Filled to the brim with novel ideas in both sound design and arrangement, this rightfully made _waves_ when it dropped - and the super fun street interviewing promo tactics helped push it out into even the heavy jazz fanatic's feeds. Now, Noa is back on the Neosignal sublabel with his biggest project so far, the 5-track journey through his very own biggest annoyances, **Tired of:**. \n\n**1.2. Tired of:**  \n\nFirst on the list: **convincing**. Whether Noa's grievances concern convincing label heads of his unique vision or convincing himself to go ahead with the wonderful weirdness he's creating, we may never know, but either way I'm incredible glad he managed to push through it, because this EP opener's journey through the whirlwind of excellent, fast-paced drum work, fleeting bleeps, fun vocal chops, and outstanding synth action had instantly convinced me in no time. Even without the sheer insanity that is the sense-overwhelming second drop I'd have considered this a Best Of 2025 contender, but now it's an inevitability. To recover from this madness, we slow down to explore Noa's feelings on relationships, with beautifully weird, thoroughly melancholic synth melodies on the lethargic Halftime bop that is **bondings**. \n\nThat's not the last we hear about his **commitment** issues though, as we approach this mid-point of the experience with a renewed sense of speed, more rhythmically satisfying drum action, and shiny, floating and chopped-up synths that on the one hand make you feel quite nice about this bond you are participating in, but thanks to a healthy dose of mind-bending distortion, you've also got this creeping feeling that something's not quite right. You know what Noa also doesn't like? Comparisons. Especially with himself. Stop numéro quatre **comparing myself** explores the psychological effects of doing too much of just that, with an absolutely insidious, straight-up infectious melody, very particular rhythms and relentless vocal chops slowly but surely drilling themselves into your brain - especially in the second half - leaving you completely broken. \n\nThe last thing on Noa's list: **you**. Yes, you. Be ashamed of yourself already! Mirroring the opener in its use of singular piano notes and general structure, but with a significantly more aggressive energy, this finale whips up a storm of hectic drums, waves of vibrating basses, and heavily processed vocal chops that keeps on growing and growing, until finally unleashing its full potential with some truly mind-melting synths taking over. \n\n**1.3. Conclusion**  \n\nA crazy journey of self-discovery, all wrapped up in exceedingly insane drumwork, stunning sound design and melancholic melodicality. One thing's for certain, I'll not get tired of OBSES' music anytime soon. Noa Choukroun? More like Yes-a Choukroun. \n\nOther techy things from this week:  \n- MIYAMORO, Laetho - Circles / Save Me  \n- Mo Falk, ZENEA, ILSE - Falling (Nonexistent Remix)  \n- LoveTheEND - Silver Lights EP  \n- OZZY! - i wanna see your smile again.. 💎  \n- Refracta, Si Heath - INQUIETO  \n\n---\n\n####**2. Catching Cairo, LZee, Bastion - Open Season [UKF]**  \n*Recommended if you like: Shy FX*  \n\nThere's no way I would _not_ feature this absolute _bop_ of a tune, not in a million years. So let's introduce our participants! \n\n**2.1. Catching Cairo**\n\nFirst up: **Tiffani Singh-Brown**! Growing up in North London's Edmonton with a mom singhing as many Jazz, Motown and general 60s bangers as possible instilled so much musicality into her, that she and her siblings got involved themselves as well, from the grime bars she spat with her brother to the song choreos she performed with her sisters. While this time as **Tilli B** might not be what you know her from, it was the foundation for her life as the artist you might do know her as: **Tiffani Juno**! Depending on how far you already went down the rabbit hole, you might not have heard that she won a songwriting competition held by _Sony/ATV_ and provided backing vocals for Iggy Azalea's album at the time, but perhaps her early work with _Jakwob_, _Anile_, _Ed West_, or _Taelimb_ rings a bell. Or this little tune called _Touch_, with those unknown Liquid boys called _Hybrid Minds_ or something weird like that. \n\nWhile making a name for herself with more and more stunning anthemic top lines for the H and the M, she realised she wanted to take this whole thing even further. Listening to her sister's advice to _not_ study law, she enrolled and earned herself a master's in Commercial Music, and by 2020, she was ready to pounce, but not under the Juno moniker - she was on more of a **Catching Cairo** vibe from then on! 2021 saw Tiff not only releasing her debut EP _When It's Over_, she also performed her very first headline show and collaborated with _Mungo's HiFi_, _Gardna_ and _Emba_. Over the following years, the DreameR D&amp;B girl racked up more and more collabo-heaters with the likes of _BCee_, _Sustance_, _Kasra_, _Hybrid Minds_, _Turno_, _Dogger_ and _Simula_, some of which also ended up forming her _Aura_ EP on the one and only UKF, to the point she became more inescapable than ever. Now, she returns to the three-lettered imprint with what I'd hope is gonna be one of her biggest tunes yet - roll the next artist intro! \n\n**2.2. LZee**  \n\nNext on the roster: **LZee**! Not only was half-Barbadosian Sonny \"LZee\" Catwell similarly born in the big L to the small ondon, his passion for music also goes back to his early teenage days, when he would learn to spit bars during freestyle sesh's with his friends at school. At 13 (!), his family's connections allowed him to start hitting the studio, and by 16, he had already landed his very first massive hit, _Elementary_. That was in 2000, by the way. Together with his go-to producers _JT_, _Twist_ and _Milts_, the young lad would go on to show the world what he's capable of, with his mixtape _L4zy Town_ being a clear highlight, eventually earning himself praise from veteran _AJ Tracey_, who adored Sonny's unique influences cocktail of UK Rap, Grime, and Garage. More and more, the initially Hip-Hop-focused productions would become more dance-y, in a British sense, and by 2024, his repertoire would even include DnB, from his various works with _Toddla T_, to the straight-up banger with _Lens_, to even his newest offering, the heartbreaking conscious liquid DnB vibe _homeless_. So who's producing this one then? \n\n**2.3. Bastion**  \n\nThe last name of the bunch, the ones responsible for the beats behind it all: **Bastion**! Previously cloaked in mystery, the Dancefloor duo finally unveiled their true identities in 2023: it's the **Fade Black** bois! Who, you ask? Well, on the one hand we've got Andrew **Shyun** Khavand, the classically trained musician turned electronic music enthusiast, whose was working on his first WIPs all the way back in 2011, but kept his productions close to his chest until 2016, when he started dropping little nuggets of gold on the likes of _Mayan Audio_, _Kill Tomorrow_, and, of course, _Critical Music_. On said imprint, Andrew had been teaming up with a particularly sick newcomer, Nick **Cruk** Hunter! This guitar nerd, multi band member and most handsome boy award winner's journey into DnB started when he was just a mere 16 years of age, but only fully started to unravel four years later, in the early 2010s. As Cruk, or _CruK_, or _CruK/inhibit_, the NeurofunkGrid regular smashed out Neuro bangers on the likes of _Genome_, _Ammunition_ and _Bad Taste_, and featured on mad man _Merikan_'s tunes, but as time went on, things got more technical. From _Lifted_ to _Skankandbass_, from _Titan_ to _Dispatched_, from _Close2Death_ to _Critical_'s Binary series, with even _Blackout_ and _Invisible_ eventually hosting his productions, Nick had grown to love the heavy yet minimal, \"skatimal\" type of sound.\n\nWhile 2019 saw their very first fully collaborative EP hit the shelves, the duo had been working together at _AI.Music_, the company Andrew and two of his friends founded in 2016, on production for dozens of rappers, singers, firms, and more, covering anything from Grime and Hip Hop to Electronica and Neo Soul. Later that same collab-EP pre-pandemic year, the two of them actually fully got together, and formed the unstoppable **Fade Black**! With tunes like _Sane_ and _Polaris_, and remixes for anthems like _Blej_, _Loa_ and _Get Deaded_, they truly _bombarded_ the scene with tunes both sleek and phat, but they wanted to try out something else. Come 2021, a new face emerged: **Bastion**! Launched with their winning remix for Sub Focus' legendary _Stomp_ remix competition, and shot right into everyone's ears with the earworm that was _Shapes_, with _Catching Cairo_, the at the time still mysteriously cloaked bois had everyone guessing who the hell these two might be. From their _Light Work_ EP and other one-offs on _UKF_ to their remix of _Jax Jones_ and their seemingly forever dub rework of _Take You Higher_, they had built up quite the discography, but after years of masking up, even on stage, it was time to break free, by collaborating with their alter egos on _Blood &amp; Gold_ in 2023. Priorities shifting back and forth, the two had become a bit quiet on the Bastion front, until finally returning with _Radio VIP_ late last year, and, well, this one now!\n\n**2.4. Open Season**  \n\nMultiple layers of twangy electronic guitar cut through the crowd chatter of this live performance atmosphere, and with LZee breaking out the tequila, these riffs and swift, steppy drums form a groove so tasty that literally anything could follow and it'd still be a banger. Lucky for us, we've got none other than Catching Cairo cheekily calling out the titular Open Season with so much flair in her performance that I dare you to try to not become obsessed with this one. It's impossible. That little tweak right before _Giving you new faith to believe in_ and that scratch before _that's energy for the whole damn weekend_ - perfection. From this perfect intro, we keep on ridin' right into Tiff's call and response with Sonny on top of a brassed-up instrumental to form the absolute earworm of a chorus. As if not sick enough already, LZee stylishly follows with an absolutely wildly flow part of his own, before we jump right back into the hook's dance. For the grand finale, we not only got Tilli B spitting bars with an _unbelievable_ drip, but also LZee showing off his absolute _command_ over the mic in a wonderfully adlib-filled part. \n\n**2.5. Conclusion**  \n\nFantastically fresh flows, a captivatingly catchy chorus, an immensely incendiary instrumental, all of it _dripping_ with style. An instant classic.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n---\n\n#New Releases\n###General DnB / Mixed\n\n* Aitor Hertz - Free *[FUTURE]* | , [**[Spotify]**](https://open.spotify.com/album/3XJllgYl9yTCYh6M2DCbiq)\n* BC#9, Paper Dragon -

OBSES - Tired of: [NËU]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended if you like: Sleepnet, IMANU, Maysev&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through this format, I&amp;#39;ve come across oh so many new, sometimes pretty exciting names, but rarely has a completely new name blown me away as much as &lt;strong&gt;NËU&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#39;s nëwest outstanding finding &lt;strong&gt;OBSES&lt;/strong&gt; has. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.1. Law-abiding Virtualchemist&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, that means there&amp;#39;s more to his music journey than just the few releases you can see on the Spotify page, you&amp;#39;ve hopefully learned as much from the countless examples I&amp;#39;ve given over the years. So what else is there, then? Well, the first signs of online activity I can find of &lt;strong&gt;Noa Choukroun&lt;/strong&gt;, the Frenchie behind it all, points to an alias he established in 2019: &lt;strong&gt;Virtual Law&lt;/strong&gt;! Sometimes also written as &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; Virtual Law, this alias was Noa&amp;#39;s outlet for the sounds of Progressive Trance (my phone wanted to autocorrect this to &lt;em&gt;Progressive France&lt;/em&gt;), Psy-france, and Melodic Techno, first on his very own Soundcloud, but later also on labels like &lt;em&gt;NBM&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Blue Tunes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Red Tunes&lt;/em&gt;. As the world opened up a bit again after the first waves of the pandemic, you could see Noa practising his Virtual Law live at DIEZE Warehouse and Le Bikini, among other places. However, it wasn&amp;#39;t always all fun and Trance, Noa also sneaked a couple &lt;em&gt;Noisia&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Caracal Project&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fade Black&lt;/em&gt; and even &lt;em&gt;Dimension&lt;/em&gt; tunes into his sets here and there, and by 2023, the D and the B had fully taken over, to the point of &lt;strong&gt;OBSES&lt;/strong&gt;sion. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting with his self-released, uniquely-titled explorations of the expertly technical and futuristically melodic, from post-seperation emotional journey &lt;em&gt;I just broke up, lol.&lt;/em&gt; to procrastination anthem &lt;em&gt;chill, imma start tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;. Shortly after, in summer of 2024, Noa&amp;#39;s shouckingly good debut double single on the ever-incredible &lt;strong&gt;NËU&lt;/strong&gt; made the rounds. Filled to the brim with novel ideas in both sound design and arrangement, this rightfully made &lt;em&gt;waves&lt;/em&gt; when it dropped - and the super fun street interviewing promo tactics helped push it out into even the heavy jazz fanatic&amp;#39;s feeds. Now, Noa is back on the Neosignal sublabel with his biggest project so far, the 5-track journey through his very own biggest annoyances, &lt;strong&gt;Tired of:&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.2. Tired of:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First on the list: &lt;strong&gt;convincing&lt;/strong&gt;. Whether Noa&amp;#39;s grievances concern convincing label heads of his unique vision or convincing himself to go ahead with the wonderful weirdness he&amp;#39;s creating, we may never know, but either way I&amp;#39;m incredible glad he managed to push through it, because this EP opener&amp;#39;s journey through the whirlwind of excellent, fast-paced drum work, fleeting bleeps, fun vocal chops, and outstanding synth action had instantly convinced me in no time. Even without the sheer insanity that is the sense-overwhelming second drop I&amp;#39;d have considered this a Best Of 2025 contender, but now it&amp;#39;s an inevitability. To recover from this madness, we slow down to explore Noa&amp;#39;s feelings on relationships, with beautifully weird, thoroughly melancholic synth melodies on the lethargic Halftime bop that is &lt;strong&gt;bondings&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not the last we hear about his &lt;strong&gt;commitment&lt;/strong&gt; issues though, as we approach this mid-point of the experience with a renewed sense of speed, more rhythmically satisfying drum action, and shiny, floating and chopped-up synths that on the one hand make you feel quite nice about this bond you are participating in, but thanks to a healthy dose of mind-bending distortion, you&amp;#39;ve also got this creeping feeling that something&amp;#39;s not quite right. You know what Noa also doesn&amp;#39;t like? Comparisons. Especially with himself. Stop numéro quatre &lt;strong&gt;comparing myself&lt;/strong&gt; explores the psychological effects of doing too much of just that, with an absolutely insidious, straight-up infectious melody, very particular rhythms and relentless vocal chops slowly but surely drilling themselves into your brain - especially in the second half - leaving you completely broken. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last thing on Noa&amp;#39;s list: &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, you. Be ashamed of yourself already! Mirroring the opener in its use of singular piano notes and general structure, but with a significantly more aggressive energy, this finale whips up a storm of hectic drums, waves of vibrating basses, and heavily processed vocal chops that keeps on growing and growing, until finally unleashing its full potential with some truly mind-melting synths taking over. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.3. Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A crazy journey of self-discovery, all wrapped up in exceedingly insane drumwork, stunning sound design and melancholic melodicality. One thing&amp;#39;s for certain, I&amp;#39;ll not get tired of OBSES&amp;#39; music anytime soon. Noa Choukroun? More like Yes-a Choukroun. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other techy things from this week:&lt;br/&gt;\n- MIYAMORO, Laetho - Circles / Save Me&lt;br/&gt;\n- Mo Falk, ZENEA, ILSE - Falling (Nonexistent Remix)&lt;br/&gt;\n- LoveTheEND - Silver Lights EP&lt;br/&gt;\n- OZZY! - i wanna see your smile again.. 💎&lt;br/&gt;\n- Refracta, Si Heath - INQUIETO  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Catching Cairo, LZee, Bastion - Open Season [UKF]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recommended if you like: Shy FX&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s no way I would &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; feature this absolute &lt;em&gt;bop&lt;/em&gt; of a tune, not in a million years. So let&amp;#39;s introduce our participants! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.1. Catching Cairo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First up: &lt;strong&gt;Tiffani Singh-Brown&lt;/strong&gt;! Growing up in North London&amp;#39;s Edmonton with a mom singhing as many Jazz, Motown and general 60s bangers as possible instilled so much musicality into her, that she and her siblings got involved themselves as well, from the grime bars she spat with her brother to the song choreos she performed with her sisters. While this time as &lt;strong&gt;Tilli B&lt;/strong&gt; might not be what you know her from, it was the foundation for her life as the artist you might do know her as: &lt;strong&gt;Tiffani Juno&lt;/strong&gt;! Depending on how far you already went down the rabbit hole, you might not have heard that she won a songwriting competition held by &lt;em&gt;Sony/ATV&lt;/em&gt; and provided backing vocals for Iggy Azalea&amp;#39;s album at the time, but perhaps her early work with &lt;em&gt;Jakwob&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Anile&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ed West&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Taelimb&lt;/em&gt; rings a bell. Or this little tune called &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;, with those unknown Liquid boys called &lt;em&gt;Hybrid Minds&lt;/em&gt; or something weird like that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While making a name for herself with more and more stunning anthemic top lines for the H and the M, she realised she wanted to take this whole thing even further. Listening to her sister&amp;#39;s advice to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; study law, she enrolled and earned herself a master&amp;#39;s in Commercial Music, and by 2020, she was ready to pounce, but not under the Juno moniker - she was on more of a &lt;strong&gt;Catching Cairo&lt;/strong&gt; vibe from then on! 2021 saw Tiff not only releasing her debut EP &lt;em&gt;When It&amp;#39;s Over&lt;/em&gt;, she also performed her very first headline show and collaborated with &lt;em&gt;Mungo&amp;#39;s HiFi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gardna&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Emba&lt;/em&gt;. Over the following years, the DreameR D&amp;amp;B girl racked up more and more collabo-heaters with the likes of &lt;em&gt;BCee&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sustance&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kasra&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hybrid Minds&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Turno&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dogger&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Simula&lt;/em&gt;, some of which also ended up forming her &lt;em&gt;Aura&lt;/em&gt; EP on the one and only UKF, to the point she became more inescapable than ever. Now, she returns to the three-lettered imprint with what I&amp;#39;d hope is gonna be one of her biggest tunes yet - roll the next artist intro! &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.2. LZee&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next on the roster: &lt;strong&gt;LZee&lt;/strong&gt;! Not only was half-Barbadosian Sonny &amp;quot;LZee&amp;quot; Catwell similarly born in the big L to the small ondon, his passion for music also goes back to his early teenage days, when he would learn to spit bars during freestyle sesh&amp;#39;s with his friends at school. At 13 (!), his family&amp;#39;s connections allowed him to start hitting the studio, and by 16, he had already landed his very first massive hit, &lt;em&gt;Elementary&lt;/em&gt;. That was in 2000, by the way. Together with his go-to producers &lt;em&gt;JT&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Twist&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Milts&lt;/em&gt;, the young lad would go on to show the world what he&amp;#39;s capable of, with his mixtape &lt;em&gt;L4zy Town&lt;/em&gt; being a clear highlight, eventually earning himself praise from veteran &lt;em&gt;AJ Tracey&lt;/em&gt;, who adored Sonny&amp;#39;s unique influences cocktail of UK Rap, Grime, and Garage. More and more, the initially Hip-Hop-focused productions would become more dance-y, in a British sense, and by 2024, his repertoire would even include DnB, from his various works with &lt;em&gt;Toddla T&lt;/em&gt;, to the straight-up banger with &lt;em&gt;Lens&lt;/em&gt;, to even his newest offering, the heartbreaking conscious liquid DnB vibe &lt;em&gt;homeless&lt;/em&gt;. So who&amp;#39;s producing this one then? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.3. Bastion&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The last name of the bunch, the ones responsible for the beats behind it all: &lt;strong&gt;Bastion&lt;/strong&gt;! Previously cloaked in mystery, the Dancefloor duo finally unveiled their true identities in 2023: it&amp;#39;s the &lt;strong&gt;Fade Black&lt;/strong&gt; bois! Who, you ask? Well, on the one hand we&amp;#39;ve got Andrew &lt;strong&gt;Shyun&lt;/strong&gt; Khavand, the classically trained musician turned electronic music enthusiast, whose was working on his first WIPs all the way back in 2011, but kept his productions close to his chest until 2016, when he started dropping little nuggets of gold on the likes of &lt;em&gt;Mayan Audio&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kill Tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;, and, of course, &lt;em&gt;Critical Music&lt;/em&gt;. On said imprint, Andrew had been teaming up with a particularly sick newcomer, Nick &lt;strong&gt;Cruk&lt;/strong&gt; Hunter! This guitar nerd, multi band member and most handsome boy award winner&amp;#39;s journey into DnB started when he was just a mere 16 years of age, but only fully started to unravel four years later, in the early 2010s. As Cruk, or &lt;em&gt;CruK&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;CruK/inhibit&lt;/em&gt;, the NeurofunkGrid regular smashed out Neuro bangers on the likes of &lt;em&gt;Genome&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ammunition&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bad Taste&lt;/em&gt;, and featured on mad man &lt;em&gt;Merikan&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s tunes, but as time went on, things got more technical. From &lt;em&gt;Lifted&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Skankandbass&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;Titan&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Dispatched&lt;/em&gt;, from &lt;em&gt;Close2Death&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Critical&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s Binary series, with even &lt;em&gt;Blackout&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Invisible&lt;/em&gt; eventually hosting his productions, Nick had grown to love the heavy yet minimal, &amp;quot;skatimal&amp;quot; type of sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While 2019 saw their very first fully collaborative EP hit the shelves, the duo had been working together at &lt;em&gt;AI.Music&lt;/em&gt;, the company Andrew and two of his friends founded in 2016, on production for dozens of rappers, singers, firms, and more, covering anything from Grime and Hip Hop to Electronica and Neo Soul. Later that same collab-EP pre-pandemic year, the two of them actually fully got together, and formed the unstoppable &lt;strong&gt;Fade Black&lt;/strong&gt;! With tunes like &lt;em&gt;Sane&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Polaris&lt;/em&gt;, and remixes for anthems like &lt;em&gt;Blej&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Loa&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Get Deaded&lt;/em&gt;, they truly &lt;em&gt;bombarded&lt;/em&gt; the scene with tunes both sleek and phat, but they wanted to try out something else. Come 2021, a new face emerged: &lt;strong&gt;Bastion&lt;/strong&gt;! Launched with their winning remix for Sub Focus&amp;#39; legendary &lt;em&gt;Stomp&lt;/em&gt; remix competition, and shot right into everyone&amp;#39;s ears with the earworm that was &lt;em&gt;Shapes&lt;/em&gt;, with &lt;em&gt;Catching Cairo&lt;/em&gt;, the at the time still mysteriously cloaked bois had everyone guessing who the hell these two might be. From their &lt;em&gt;Light Work&lt;/em&gt; EP and other one-offs on &lt;em&gt;UKF&lt;/em&gt; to their remix of &lt;em&gt;Jax Jones&lt;/em&gt; and their seemingly forever dub rework of &lt;em&gt;Take You Higher&lt;/em&gt;, they had built up quite the discography, but after years of masking up, even on stage, it was time to break free, by collaborating with their alter egos on &lt;em&gt;Blood &amp;amp; Gold&lt;/em&gt; in 2023. Priorities shifting back and forth, the two had become a bit quiet on the Bastion front, until finally returning with &lt;em&gt;Radio VIP&lt;/em&gt; late last year, and, well, this one now!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.4. Open Season&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Multiple layers of twangy electronic guitar cut through the crowd chatter of this live performance atmosphere, and with LZee breaking out the tequila, these riffs and swift, steppy drums form a groove so tasty that literally anything could follow and it&amp;#39;d still be a banger. Lucky for us, we&amp;#39;ve got none other than Catching Cairo cheekily calling out the titular Open Season with so much flair in her performance that I dare you to try to not become obsessed with this one. It&amp;#39;s impossible. That little tweak right before &lt;em&gt;Giving you new faith to believe in&lt;/em&gt; and that scratch before &lt;em&gt;that&amp;#39;s energy for the whole damn weekend&lt;/em&gt; - perfection. From this perfect intro, we keep on ridin&amp;#39; right into Tiff&amp;#39;s call and response with Sonny on top of a brassed-up instrumental to form the absolute earworm of a chorus. As if not sick enough already, LZee stylishly follows with an absolutely wildly flow part of his own, before we jump right back into the hook&amp;#39;s dance. For the grand finale, we not only got Tilli B spitting bars with an &lt;em&gt;unbelievable&lt;/em&gt; drip, but also LZee showing off his absolute &lt;em&gt;command&lt;/em&gt; over the mic in a wonderfully adlib-filled part. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.5. Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fantastically fresh flows, a captivatingly catchy chorus, an immensely incendiary instrumental, all of it &lt;em&gt;dripping&lt;/em&gt; with style. An instant classic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;New Releases&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;General DnB / Mixed&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Aitor Hertz - Free &lt;em&gt;[FUTURE]&lt;/em&gt;

I’m not sure it’s actually possible to eat badly. But I’ll mention when it was REALLY good.\n* The locals are beyond polite, especially if they’re paid to be -otherwise they kind of stay out of your way. Occasionally they look terrified if you ask them for help.\n* As an anime fan it was lovely to see anime as part of the culture, but also somewhat sad to see how commercial it is compared to how edgy and cool one felt in 1996 watching it for the first time. Also as mentioned most things are all now related to mobile games and mainstream anime which I find quite boring.\n* The heat. it is savage but survivable. We had chili water bottles that would usually last the day plus another drink of indeterminate nature at some point. Popping into Starbucks or a mall occasionally was useful. Sunscreen, obvs, but the secret weapon is the umbrella/parasol. This allows you to survive heme parks but I wouldn't reccommend outdoor afternoon activities without one. Things calm down substantially at sundown, around 6:45 when we went, so we tended to sleep later and get moving around 11, then attempt to do an inside activity when the sun's at it's zenith at 12-2. We also bought sweat cloths, a very useful tool and I redeodoranted about twice a day.  However I didn't find the mini electric fan that useful overall, but used it occasionally because it was cool (just not in the way you want)\n\n\n**In depth analysis***\n\n28 First thing we see on the airport train is a young man unconscious on the floor. I heard this happens to businessmen sometimes, but nobody checks he;s OK so I assume this is standard stuff. Happened enough times to a mate of mine, let’s just hope he survived. ~Don Quixote~ truly blew my mind upon first seeing it. So much silly stuff seemingly randomly placed. Bob Sapp CBD drinks. Bizarre alcohol. Utterly inappropriate anime figures. Even my little ADHD brain was a little overwhelmed. However we were utterly exhausted and didn’t buy anything. ~Taito station~ was disappointing given how little actual games there were (very few), but there were at least some machines, keeping my hope that arcades still live in some capacity. We didn’t have the cash with us, so we didn’t play anything. ~Overall Akihabara is a must see,~ but I was immediately struck with the feeling that at the age of 45 I didn’t want any of this stuff. I love anime but I don’t have space or the need for a million not that great collectibles. Most stuff is all the latest series (MHA, one piece, Genshin impact, honkai star rail) and nothing for classic animes or any of my obscure favourites, not even much Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure stuff. The gatcha machines and cranes are fun but I don’t know why the Japanese need floors and floors of it. I did want to go to the miad cafe, but there are so many it’s impossible to decide, so I left it till Sapporo where I heard the maids speak some English. Don Potato for me was a disappointment. If you’re a real retro collector, you might find some gems, but they’re all in Japanese and for me, I have a Retroid so don’t need any physical retro products. They’re not that cheap either.\n\n29 Wake up late and check out the markets and shrine at ~Asakusa.~ The heat is beyond ridiculous. Overall its is lovely. We wish for something at a shrine but my wife won’t tell me what it is. Luckily, it;s a “good fortune.” We find an empty tonkatsu restaurant run by a little old man and the experience is amazing.  In the evening we check out Shibuya,I tick off the statue of Hachiko and scramble crossing after having seen thekm in so many animes and video games - guess what, they are rather underwhelming IRL but Shibuya is certainly impressive - then we wander around looking for some food before finding an outstanding gyoza place on the second floor. I didn’t know that you would get something this good in the middle of the tourist district. Only young locals were in there. Seeing a nice young lady dressed up like a cross between Joan Jett and Alice in Wonderland devouring gyoza while playing Switch all by herself was all I ever needed from this trip.\n\n30 ~Immersive Fort~ for me was excellent, the kind of thing you will only see in Japan. That said, I have been to other “immersive theater” events before (Phantom Peak in London) and the concept is similar - others have said the park feels a bit empty and it does. I was extremely impressed by the main event, The Sherlock - it took some getting used to, but what you do is follow actors around an IMMENSE area where so much effort has been put in, and you’re free to go where you like and discover the mystery out of order. Our audi guides worked well for the most part and we managed to follow most of the mystery - it plays out like one of the lesser Phoenix Wright cases, and being Japan, it of course had to have a little bit at the end that made the whole thing make no sense. I emailed them later for clarification, but they said that they wouldn’t tell! You would get more out of this park if you can speak Japanese, but would heavily recommend. ~Teamlab Planets~ was truly astounding. You can see what it’s like from the online imagery but you cannot comprehend the experience. I think nobody alive would not enjoy this. My wife had already been to the other one which I hear is “better” but it seems they’re different enough to justify either.\n\n31 ~Harajuku~ is essentially a mess. High end shopping streets (which are very nice if you like that) and then a load of touristy stuff stuffed up a single street. It sure has character though. The animal cafes will certainly be divisive. We went to the miipig cafe and the girls just basically bury you in pigs. It’s at this point we notice that the Japanese staff will basically not interact with you outside of basic business and they seem constantly uncomfortable being asked anything, which makes sense but we could have done with a bit of guidance than just having pigs thrown at us. ~Yoyogi Park~ I found truly impressive. Just the sheer size of it, it’s like being in another world. I’m tempted to wander off the path but my wife reminds me the forests are full of ghosts in Japan so I think better of it. We walk to ~Shinjuku~ in the blazing heat, looking for the bar Deathmatch in Hell, but we are simply too tired to continue past the station. Then the rain comes down and we didn’t bring the umbrella. We call it quits and go back to the hotel and then fall asleep almost immediately - at least my wife does because I spend every evening for the rest of the trip quickly turning over from the dull Olympics and enjoying bursts of random nonsense of Japanese TV together with a 9% whiskey highball or lemon sour. \n\n1 The airport food is delicious and the flights super efficient with no hassle. Everything in Japan runs on time to the second. We arrive in ~Sapporo~ and it has a friendly vibe around it. Tanukikoji is great. Again, just a great vibe and a lot of tourists from Asia, but not too crowded. We have another go in the arcades and enjoy a game of House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn and a few rounds of the drumming game. We even have a go of Sonic Blast Heroes because we’ve been doing some self defence classes in the gym but my wife hates it. She’s right, it was always lame. Everywhere is quite busy for food so we try the Bearfoot diner, all the staff are non-Japanese and speak English. You can see some fellow travellers are up for a chat, too- I’m not sure how great the food was compared to the rest of the top level stuff we’ve been having but there was something soothing about it. \n\n2 The ~Sapporo beer museum~ seems like it’s in the wrong part of town and it’s hellishly hot on the way there. Although it’s in a nice place, it’s tiny and contains almost nothing, and then is just a place to drink beers. We leave quickly and spend an hour wait for the sushi place by poking around a recycle store - the highlight is seeing a guy picking through the secondhand lolicon figures inspecting every one. The toriton sushi, strangely enough, does not actually have sushi on conveyor belts, just being a screen ordering place as usual but it’s absolutely outstanding. Totally exhausted and we check out ~AOAO (Sapporo aquarium)~ which is also in a great mall and I sample my first Hokkaido ice cream - how good is this Hokkaido milk really? The answer is ridiculously amazing. So creamy and somewhat cheesy even. The aquarium, we are not sure about at the start but turns out to be one of the trips’ highlights - so chilled and relaxing and the middle floor has an awesome collection of much lesser seen creatures. Only negative is the penguins on the top floor seem to be poorly housed and one of them has clearly gone insane, trying to drive itself relentlessly through the glass wall. Apart from that it’s awesome if not a little expensive and has some of the cuter souvenirs of the trip.\n\n3 After picking up the rail pass at the station: We go to have Jingiskhan at the ~TV tower~ with the locals. All the servers look really miserable, but the customers are having a great time. I’m familiar with korean BBQ but I find the rilled lamb especially amazing. We put some chinese cabbage on the grill for the second round and are immediately stopped by a terrified man who lets us know we have committed a fatal error, as politely as possible of course. The TV tower is surprisingly fun and full of merch that seems cute and unique but we will see repeated many times.  ~Maidreamin~ is certainly an experience. I see some people being super anti maid cafes but I would say there is no way you cannot go to one. The girls are terrified to see us but my god to they do their daman best to put on some kind of a show. Only other people in there are a group of guys having a birthday and an old man eating a full meal by himself. We get a Sexy lemon sour and a cute bear parfait that is enchanted by the 2 maids, I annoy and interrupt them at every turn, not on purpose of course, but they warm up towards the end. I suspect that a native Japanese would get a bit more value out of them as they’re supposed to do some “cute” things, one of them puts some glasses on at one point and that’s it. Altogether it was unmissable and the photo of them we have looking confused and bored will last until the end of time. Onto the ~University Museum,~ it’s a bit stuffy but in the best way, it really is a university museum and a great building, I would strongly recommend. We finish in the pop up beer garden, as with many things on the trip is seems impenetrable at first but the wonderful staff help us figure it out and it’s such a cool place to be, until the heavens open, the rain comes down and that’s the end of it. Watching the reaction of the locals is quite hilarious, some just stick it out under umbrellas, others are visibly trembling at the thought of their hair or loli costumes wet.\n\n4 ~Otaru~ is definitely worth a visit although it’s a bit like Japanese Blackpool. Many tourists but the canal cruise is great and the Birmingham accent English voice is priceless. The highlight of the trip is the street festival, everyone is in yukatas, there are people breaking out into sing song all over the town as the sun goers down and every stall is selling amazing street food including the local fried chicken, Zangi, which is ginger or saffron flavourerd, and the long fries, same as the milk - how good can Hokkaidan potatoes be? RIDICULOUS. So fluffy and crispy, you will have never encountered anything like this. We finish off with a concert from the local Christian church, it’s certainly high energy which is both bad and good.  \n\n5 On arriving in ~Asahikawa~ it's the first time we hit the “everything closed” for lunch problem. My cries to eat in the station fall on deaf ears (we find an amazing food court  there later!) and after much searching there’s a huge queue in Satan’s sun for the good ramen place - impossible for any non native. In the end we have an (amazing) meal in a fast food beef bowl chain. The tourist information at the station speak little to no English and direct us to the ~sake museum~ which like the beer museum is in the middle of nowhere. It is tiny, contains almost nothing, the staff hide from us and finally reveal you can buy sake but not drink it on the premises. We leave. That evening we go back to town and try an izakaya after two drunk guys spill out and make motions to tell us how good the food is - we sit right next to the grill and get some legendary food, amazing atmosphere and one staff speaks Engliush and waits on us like a personal butler. Sad that we weren’t allowed tip him!\n\n6 After some more detective work we book the tickets to the “Joyful” Nrokko train and it is indeed delightful. The countryside is lovely but it turns out the lavender and flowers are just a tiny area packed with tourists at ~Tomita lavender farm.~ Due to the heat and the small area there really isn;t much going on, we get back to the station only to find out we misread the time and have to stay another hour - the toilet attendant at the the temporary platform speaks no English but is again amazingly helpful. We decide to hit the pop up  ~beer garden~  at the station and eat a little item from every stall, it’s all amazing and I think one of the girls makes fun of me for ordering a lemon sour badly but that’s probably on me. The stall owners on the other hand are thrilled we’re ordering from them and it’s not too busy, overall a smash for the otherwise tiny Asahikawa.\n\n7 train to Sapporo and then on to ~Noboribetsu.~  For me Noboribetsu might have been the top highlight. We’re actually in Noboribetsu Onsen, basically a street of hotels and spas surrounded by forested mountains and covered in little Oni statues. Indeed, there are a lot of statues and a huge animatronic Enma, king of Hell, who puts on a little show where he turns into a demon - imagine if there was an animatronic Lucifer that turned into Satan in your home town. Jigokudani valley is indeed impressive if not a bit smelly, but the real highlight is our ryokan, Hard to put into words. The room is massive, the service like nothing on earth, and the absolutely massive Kaiseki dinner one of the greatest things I have ever eaten. The onsen I am unbsure about and it’s sad not to go in with the wife, and I get bored quite quickly but I do have to say that it was extremely refreshing and invigorating. The sleep is great too!\n\n8 I manage to misunderstand the bus and for no reason there’s no more for two hours. Date Jidaimura is a totally hilarious Edo themed park which turns out to be a blast - a yokai exhibit, goblin haunted house a ninja house and three (very similar) live shows. I love ninjas, so I’m on board, but I would have liked to see more ninja techniques rather than jumping about with some silly comedy, but despite the heat and the restaurant closing early I would heavily recommend it. We walk there and back and this is where the prasol saves out lives. It’s actually a very pleasant walk and I am super ready for another kaiseki - although I swear it’s not quite as good the second time around with a tiny bit less care put in. I think I offended one of the staff by puring drinks for us while she was serving, because a different server returns to the room. Oh well!\n\n9 And so to the last hokkaido stop, ~Hakodate.~ We get totally screwed by the early closing this time but find an extremely good ~craft beer~ place with outstanding tacos The owner speaks good English and is one of those guys just going on about his bar and business, but watching the whole crew help each other out is awesome. We are joined by some Japanese hipsters that question why they have to sit on beer barrels, just like you might in any hipster joint. The famous ~brick warehouses,~ are a bit of a let down and have some nice goods but nothing I would want or haven;t seen already. The beer hall is somewhat dingy and disappointing but we take the Blue Moon cruise at sunset exactly with a lemon sour in our hands and it’s utterly fantastic. Vistas are of limited interest to me but I cannot stress how amazing this was.\n\n10 Eating at the ~morning market,~ is every bit as good as I dreamed, a huge bowl of fresh raw seafood and a beer at 10am - I didn’t like seafood at all until a couple of years ago, now I am completely converted. We find the Mashumaru ship by accident and it turns out to be really fun and interesting, with lots of switches and buttons to flick that is fun for everyone and the whole museum is well put together too. A highlight. Back to the brick warehouses, they are still boring, and I convince the wife to eat at ~Lucky Pierrot~ which she was extremely resistant to - unfortunately it turns out to be quite weird and an odd taste and a strange, kitsch experience that would certainly appeal to some - unfortunately it does not go down well and we are forced to curse the clown’s name for evermore. One for weirdness enthusiasts and not hard to see why it hasn’t made it out of Hakodate. Overall Hakodate was a bit weird.\n\n11 And finally, down to ~Osaka~, now most people know what Osaka is like, I have to say after all the amazing experiences we’ve had I am not a huge fan - crowded beyond belief, noisy, and I’m not convinced the food is that great. After some dining disputes, we drink too much and have an underwhelming cake. I couldn’t say the takoyaki was really that amazing, to be honest. But you know what you’re getting here I guess.\n\n12 Much better vibes with ~Kuromon~ which is much more chilled and have some top level sushi. Osaka is kind of weird. Not much more to say about it. We try to visit a cool looking horror experience in ~big step mall~ but are advised that we need to speak Japanese. At this point I only just trmemeber about using Google Translate to communicate, a bit late. We decide not to queue at the vegan okonomiyaki place with the other vegan-looking tourists and end up queuing for quite some time at another one but it is so worth it I cannot express it, if not for the hilarious banter between the staff, who clearly all fancy the same waitress. We walk back through the host bar district, which us foreigners will never get to experience, but from the outside looking in it just seems awesome and hilarious. How many girly-looking dudes can you fit into one district? All the girls touting whatever kind of bars exist there all look beyond fed up.\n\n13 The grand finale - ~Universal studios Japan .~ We get the twilight ticket from Lawson after much confusion. It then turns out you’re not guaranteed entry into Nintendo world with anything but the full price ticket - and of course we do not manage to acquire them. However the heat is so ridiculous I couldn’t image jumping around a Mario world. Everyone looks half dead. I can’t see how any kids are enjoying the experience. The park is impressive but as you have probably read, it is small, and the wait times for attractions just completely unfeasible. We do make it to the MHA 4D theater, and I have to say it’s a blast. I love seeing what they come up with for this kind of thing. The wife loves it too and has no idea who these characters are. I always find it odd that characters like Mickey Mouse are eternal because they have no “storyline” but animes do, and thus require a lot of explanation as to what point in the story these side-stories are set. It shouldn’t work, but it’s great. And so we finish off with the One Piece show, which is held in the Waterworld set -how is Waterworld still a thing? It’s 80 entire minutes, completely incomprehensible (although I think after watching one One Piece saga they’re all pretty similar) and I absolutely love it. How will they do Luffy’s stretchy arms, I wonder? They don’t. It’s all just pretend play. That said there’s a lot of love for the series and it is a great show, and it has a lot of heart! And the wife got to high five Luffy at the end, we even had Shanks make an appearance next to us even though he wasn’t in the story.\n\n14 Ok that’s enough Japan.\n\n",

I’m not sure it’s actually possible to eat badly. But I’ll mention when it was REALLY good.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The locals are beyond polite, especially if they’re paid to be -otherwise they kind of stay out of your way. Occasionally they look terrified if you ask them for help.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As an anime fan it was lovely to see anime as part of the culture, but also somewhat sad to see how commercial it is compared to how edgy and cool one felt in 1996 watching it for the first time. Also as mentioned most things are all now related to mobile games and mainstream anime which I find quite boring.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The heat. it is savage but survivable. We had chili water bottles that would usually last the day plus another drink of indeterminate nature at some point. Popping into Starbucks or a mall occasionally was useful. Sunscreen, obvs, but the secret weapon is the umbrella/parasol. This allows you to survive heme parks but I wouldn&amp;#39;t reccommend outdoor afternoon activities without one. Things calm down substantially at sundown, around 6:45 when we went, so we tended to sleep later and get moving around 11, then attempt to do an inside activity when the sun&amp;#39;s at it&amp;#39;s zenith at 12-2. We also bought sweat cloths, a very useful tool and I redeodoranted about twice a day.  However I didn&amp;#39;t find the mini electric fan that useful overall, but used it occasionally because it was cool (just not in the way you want)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In depth analysis&lt;/strong&gt;*&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;28 First thing we see on the airport train is a young man unconscious on the floor. I heard this happens to businessmen sometimes, but nobody checks he;s OK so I assume this is standard stuff. Happened enough times to a mate of mine, let’s just hope he survived. ~Don Quixote~ truly blew my mind upon first seeing it. So much silly stuff seemingly randomly placed. Bob Sapp CBD drinks. Bizarre alcohol. Utterly inappropriate anime figures. Even my little ADHD brain was a little overwhelmed. However we were utterly exhausted and didn’t buy anything. ~Taito station~ was disappointing given how little actual games there were (very few), but there were at least some machines, keeping my hope that arcades still live in some capacity. We didn’t have the cash with us, so we didn’t play anything. ~Overall Akihabara is a must see,~ but I was immediately struck with the feeling that at the age of 45 I didn’t want any of this stuff. I love anime but I don’t have space or the need for a million not that great collectibles. Most stuff is all the latest series (MHA, one piece, Genshin impact, honkai star rail) and nothing for classic animes or any of my obscure favourites, not even much Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure stuff. The gatcha machines and cranes are fun but I don’t know why the Japanese need floors and floors of it. I did want to go to the miad cafe, but there are so many it’s impossible to decide, so I left it till Sapporo where I heard the maids speak some English. Don Potato for me was a disappointment. If you’re a real retro collector, you might find some gems, but they’re all in Japanese and for me, I have a Retroid so don’t need any physical retro products. They’re not that cheap either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;29 Wake up late and check out the markets and shrine at ~Asakusa.~ The heat is beyond ridiculous. Overall its is lovely. We wish for something at a shrine but my wife won’t tell me what it is. Luckily, it;s a “good fortune.” We find an empty tonkatsu restaurant run by a little old man and the experience is amazing.  In the evening we check out Shibuya,I tick off the statue of Hachiko and scramble crossing after having seen thekm in so many animes and video games - guess what, they are rather underwhelming IRL but Shibuya is certainly impressive - then we wander around looking for some food before finding an outstanding gyoza place on the second floor. I didn’t know that you would get something this good in the middle of the tourist district. Only young locals were in there. Seeing a nice young lady dressed up like a cross between Joan Jett and Alice in Wonderland devouring gyoza while playing Switch all by herself was all I ever needed from this trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;30 ~Immersive Fort~ for me was excellent, the kind of thing you will only see in Japan. That said, I have been to other “immersive theater” events before (Phantom Peak in London) and the concept is similar - others have said the park feels a bit empty and it does. I was extremely impressed by the main event, The Sherlock - it took some getting used to, but what you do is follow actors around an IMMENSE area where so much effort has been put in, and you’re free to go where you like and discover the mystery out of order. Our audi guides worked well for the most part and we managed to follow most of the mystery - it plays out like one of the lesser Phoenix Wright cases, and being Japan, it of course had to have a little bit at the end that made the whole thing make no sense. I emailed them later for clarification, but they said that they wouldn’t tell! You would get more out of this park if you can speak Japanese, but would heavily recommend. ~Teamlab Planets~ was truly astounding. You can see what it’s like from the online imagery but you cannot comprehend the experience. I think nobody alive would not enjoy this. My wife had already been to the other one which I hear is “better” but it seems they’re different enough to justify either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;31 ~Harajuku~ is essentially a mess. High end shopping streets (which are very nice if you like that) and then a load of touristy stuff stuffed up a single street. It sure has character though. The animal cafes will certainly be divisive. We went to the miipig cafe and the girls just basically bury you in pigs. It’s at this point we notice that the Japanese staff will basically not interact with you outside of basic business and they seem constantly uncomfortable being asked anything, which makes sense but we could have done with a bit of guidance than just having pigs thrown at us. ~Yoyogi Park~ I found truly impressive. Just the sheer size of it, it’s like being in another world. I’m tempted to wander off the path but my wife reminds me the forests are full of ghosts in Japan so I think better of it. We walk to ~Shinjuku~ in the blazing heat, looking for the bar Deathmatch in Hell, but we are simply too tired to continue past the station. Then the rain comes down and we didn’t bring the umbrella. We call it quits and go back to the hotel and then fall asleep almost immediately - at least my wife does because I spend every evening for the rest of the trip quickly turning over from the dull Olympics and enjoying bursts of random nonsense of Japanese TV together with a 9% whiskey highball or lemon sour. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 The airport food is delicious and the flights super efficient with no hassle. Everything in Japan runs on time to the second. We arrive in ~Sapporo~ and it has a friendly vibe around it. Tanukikoji is great. Again, just a great vibe and a lot of tourists from Asia, but not too crowded. We have another go in the arcades and enjoy a game of House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn and a few rounds of the drumming game. We even have a go of Sonic Blast Heroes because we’ve been doing some self defence classes in the gym but my wife hates it. She’s right, it was always lame. Everywhere is quite busy for food so we try the Bearfoot diner, all the staff are non-Japanese and speak English. You can see some fellow travellers are up for a chat, too- I’m not sure how great the food was compared to the rest of the top level stuff we’ve been having but there was something soothing about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 The ~Sapporo beer museum~ seems like it’s in the wrong part of town and it’s hellishly hot on the way there. Although it’s in a nice place, it’s tiny and contains almost nothing, and then is just a place to drink beers. We leave quickly and spend an hour wait for the sushi place by poking around a recycle store - the highlight is seeing a guy picking through the secondhand lolicon figures inspecting every one. The toriton sushi, strangely enough, does not actually have sushi on conveyor belts, just being a screen ordering place as usual but it’s absolutely outstanding. Totally exhausted and we check out ~AOAO (Sapporo aquarium)~ which is also in a great mall and I sample my first Hokkaido ice cream - how good is this Hokkaido milk really? The answer is ridiculously amazing. So creamy and somewhat cheesy even. The aquarium, we are not sure about at the start but turns out to be one of the trips’ highlights - so chilled and relaxing and the middle floor has an awesome collection of much lesser seen creatures. Only negative is the penguins on the top floor seem to be poorly housed and one of them has clearly gone insane, trying to drive itself relentlessly through the glass wall. Apart from that it’s awesome if not a little expensive and has some of the cuter souvenirs of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 After picking up the rail pass at the station: We go to have Jingiskhan at the ~TV tower~ with the locals. All the servers look really miserable, but the customers are having a great time. I’m familiar with korean BBQ but I find the rilled lamb especially amazing. We put some chinese cabbage on the grill for the second round and are immediately stopped by a terrified man who lets us know we have committed a fatal error, as politely as possible of course. The TV tower is surprisingly fun and full of merch that seems cute and unique but we will see repeated many times.  ~Maidreamin~ is certainly an experience. I see some people being super anti maid cafes but I would say there is no way you cannot go to one. The girls are terrified to see us but my god to they do their daman best to put on some kind of a show. Only other people in there are a group of guys having a birthday and an old man eating a full meal by himself. We get a Sexy lemon sour and a cute bear parfait that is enchanted by the 2 maids, I annoy and interrupt them at every turn, not on purpose of course, but they warm up towards the end. I suspect that a native Japanese would get a bit more value out of them as they’re supposed to do some “cute” things, one of them puts some glasses on at one point and that’s it. Altogether it was unmissable and the photo of them we have looking confused and bored will last until the end of time. Onto the ~University Museum,~ it’s a bit stuffy but in the best way, it really is a university museum and a great building, I would strongly recommend. We finish in the pop up beer garden, as with many things on the trip is seems impenetrable at first but the wonderful staff help us figure it out and it’s such a cool place to be, until the heavens open, the rain comes down and that’s the end of it. Watching the reaction of the locals is quite hilarious, some just stick it out under umbrellas, others are visibly trembling at the thought of their hair or loli costumes wet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 ~Otaru~ is definitely worth a visit although it’s a bit like Japanese Blackpool. Many tourists but the canal cruise is great and the Birmingham accent English voice is priceless. The highlight of the trip is the street festival, everyone is in yukatas, there are people breaking out into sing song all over the town as the sun goers down and every stall is selling amazing street food including the local fried chicken, Zangi, which is ginger or saffron flavourerd, and the long fries, same as the milk - how good can Hokkaidan potatoes be? RIDICULOUS. So fluffy and crispy, you will have never encountered anything like this. We finish off with a concert from the local Christian church, it’s certainly high energy which is both bad and good.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 On arriving in ~Asahikawa~ it&amp;#39;s the first time we hit the “everything closed” for lunch problem. My cries to eat in the station fall on deaf ears (we find an amazing food court  there later!) and after much searching there’s a huge queue in Satan’s sun for the good ramen place - impossible for any non native. In the end we have an (amazing) meal in a fast food beef bowl chain. The tourist information at the station speak little to no English and direct us to the ~sake museum~ which like the beer museum is in the middle of nowhere. It is tiny, contains almost nothing, the staff hide from us and finally reveal you can buy sake but not drink it on the premises. We leave. That evening we go back to town and try an izakaya after two drunk guys spill out and make motions to tell us how good the food is - we sit right next to the grill and get some legendary food, amazing atmosphere and one staff speaks Engliush and waits on us like a personal butler. Sad that we weren’t allowed tip him!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6 After some more detective work we book the tickets to the “Joyful” Nrokko train and it is indeed delightful. The countryside is lovely but it turns out the lavender and flowers are just a tiny area packed with tourists at ~Tomita lavender farm.~ Due to the heat and the small area there really isn;t much going on, we get back to the station only to find out we misread the time and have to stay another hour - the toilet attendant at the the temporary platform speaks no English but is again amazingly helpful. We decide to hit the pop up  ~beer garden~  at the station and eat a little item from every stall, it’s all amazing and I think one of the girls makes fun of me for ordering a lemon sour badly but that’s probably on me. The stall owners on the other hand are thrilled we’re ordering from them and it’s not too busy, overall a smash for the otherwise tiny Asahikawa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7 train to Sapporo and then on to ~Noboribetsu.~  For me Noboribetsu might have been the top highlight. We’re actually in Noboribetsu Onsen, basically a street of hotels and spas surrounded by forested mountains and covered in little Oni statues. Indeed, there are a lot of statues and a huge animatronic Enma, king of Hell, who puts on a little show where he turns into a demon - imagine if there was an animatronic Lucifer that turned into Satan in your home town. Jigokudani valley is indeed impressive if not a bit smelly, but the real highlight is our ryokan, Hard to put into words. The room is massive, the service like nothing on earth, and the absolutely massive Kaiseki dinner one of the greatest things I have ever eaten. The onsen I am unbsure about and it’s sad not to go in with the wife, and I get bored quite quickly but I do have to say that it was extremely refreshing and invigorating. The sleep is great too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8 I manage to misunderstand the bus and for no reason there’s no more for two hours. Date Jidaimura is a totally hilarious Edo themed park which turns out to be a blast - a yokai exhibit, goblin haunted house a ninja house and three (very similar) live shows. I love ninjas, so I’m on board, but I would have liked to see more ninja techniques rather than jumping about with some silly comedy, but despite the heat and the restaurant closing early I would heavily recommend it. We walk there and back and this is where the prasol saves out lives. It’s actually a very pleasant walk and I am super ready for another kaiseki - although I swear it’s not quite as good the second time around with a tiny bit less care put in. I think I offended one of the staff by puring drinks for us while she was serving, because a different server returns to the room. Oh well!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9 And so to the last hokkaido stop, ~Hakodate.~ We get totally screwed by the early closing this time but find an extremely good ~craft beer~ place with outstanding tacos The owner speaks good English and is one of those guys just going on about his bar and business, but watching the whole crew help each other out is awesome. We are joined by some Japanese hipsters that question why they have to sit on beer barrels, just like you might in any hipster joint. The famous ~brick warehouses,~ are a bit of a let down and have some nice goods but nothing I would want or haven;t seen already. The beer hall is somewhat dingy and disappointing but we take the Blue Moon cruise at sunset exactly with a lemon sour in our hands and it’s utterly fantastic. Vistas are of limited interest to me but I cannot stress how amazing this was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 Eating at the ~morning market,~ is every bit as good as I dreamed, a huge bowl of fresh raw seafood and a beer at 10am - I didn’t like seafood at all until a couple of years ago, now I am completely converted. We find the Mashumaru ship by accident and it turns out to be really fun and interesting, with lots of switches and buttons to flick that is fun for everyone and the whole museum is well put together too. A highlight. Back to the brick warehouses, they are still boring, and I convince the wife to eat at ~Lucky Pierrot~ which she was extremely resistant to - unfortunately it turns out to be quite weird and an odd taste and a strange, kitsch experience that would certainly appeal to some - unfortunately it does not go down well and we are forced to curse the clown’s name for evermore. One for weirdness enthusiasts and not hard to see why it hasn’t made it out of Hakodate. Overall Hakodate was a bit weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11 And finally, down to ~Osaka~, now most people know what Osaka is like, I have to say after all the amazing experiences we’ve had I am not a huge fan - crowded beyond belief, noisy, and I’m not convinced the food is that great. After some dining disputes, we drink too much and have an underwhelming cake. I couldn’t say the takoyaki was really that amazing, to be honest. But you know what you’re getting here I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12 Much better vibes with ~Kuromon~ which is much more chilled and have some top level sushi. Osaka is kind of weird. Not much more to say about it. We try to visit a cool looking horror experience in ~big step mall~ but are advised that we need to speak Japanese. At this point I only just trmemeber about using Google Translate to communicate, a bit late. We decide not to queue at the vegan okonomiyaki place with the other vegan-looking tourists and end up queuing for quite some time at another one but it is so worth it I cannot express it, if not for the hilarious banter between the staff, who clearly all fancy the same waitress. We walk back through the host bar district, which us foreigners will never get to experience, but from the outside looking in it just seems awesome and hilarious. How many girly-looking dudes can you fit into one district? All the girls touting whatever kind of bars exist there all look beyond fed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13 The grand finale - ~Universal studios Japan .~ We get the twilight ticket from Lawson after much confusion. It then turns out you’re not guaranteed entry into Nintendo world with anything but the full price ticket - and of course we do not manage to acquire them. However the heat is so ridiculous I couldn’t image jumping around a Mario world. Everyone looks half dead. I can’t see how any kids are enjoying the experience. The park is impressive but as you have probably read, it is small, and the wait times for attractions just completely unfeasible. We do make it to the MHA 4D theater, and I have to say it’s a blast. I love seeing what they come up with for this kind of thing. The wife loves it too and has no idea who these characters are. I always find it odd that characters like Mickey Mouse are eternal because they have no “storyline” but animes do, and thus require a lot of explanation as to what point in the story these side-stories are set. It shouldn’t work, but it’s great. And so we finish off with the One Piece show, which is held in the Waterworld set -how is Waterworld still a thing? It’s 80 entire minutes, completely incomprehensible (although I think after watching one One Piece saga they’re all pretty similar) and I absolutely love it. How will they do Luffy’s stretchy arms, I wonder? They don’t. It’s all just pretend play. That said there’s a lot of love for the series and it is a great show, and it has a lot of heart! And the wife got to high five Luffy at the end, we even had Shanks make an appearance next to us even though he wasn’t in the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14 Ok that’s enough Japan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I’m not sure it’s actually possible to eat badly. But I’ll mention when it was REALLY good.\n* The locals are beyond polite, especially if they’re paid to be -otherwise they kind of stay out of your way. Occasionally they look terrified if you ask them for help.\n* As an anime fan it was lovely to see anime as part of the culture, but also somewhat sad to see how commercial it is compared to how edgy and cool one felt in 1996 watching it for the first time. Also as mentioned most things are all now related to mobile games and mainstream anime which I find quite boring.\n\n\n\n28 First thing we see on the airport train is a young man unconscious on the floor. I heard this happens to businessmen sometimes, but nobody checks he;s OK so I assume this is standard stuff. Happened enough times to a mate of mine, let’s just hope he survived. ~Don Quixote~ truly blew my mind upon first seeing it. So much silly stuff seemingly randomly placed. Bob Sapp CBD drinks. Bizarre alcohol. Utterly inappropriate anime figures. Even my little ADHD brain was a little overwhelmed. However we were utterly exhausted and didn’t buy anything. ~Taito station~ was disappointing given how little actual games there were (very few), but there were at least some machines, keeping my hope that arcades still live in some capacity. We didn’t have the cash with us, so we didn’t play anything. ~Overall Akihabara is a must see,~ but I was immediately struck with the feeling that at the age of 45 I didn’t want any of this stuff. I love anime but I don’t have space or the need for a million not that great collectibles. Most stuff is all the latest series (MHA, one piece, Genshin impact, honkai star rail) and nothing for classic animes or any of my obscure favourites, not even much Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure stuff. The gatcha machines and cranes are fun but I don’t know why the Japanese need floors and floors of it. I did want to go to the miad cafe, but there are so many it’s impossible to decide, so I left it till Sapporo where I heard the maids speak some English. Don Potato for me was a disappointment. If you’re a real retro collector, you might find some gems, but they’re all in Japanese and for me, I have a Retroid so don’t need any physical retro products. They’re not that cheap either.\n\n29 Wake up late and check out the markets and shrine at ~Asakusa.~ The heat is beyond ridiculous. Overall its is lovely. We wish for something at a shrine but my wife won’t tell me what it is. Luckily, it;s a “good fortune.” We find an empty tonkatsu restaurant run by a little old man and the experience is amazing.  In the evening we check out Shibuya,I tick off the statue of Hachiko and scramble crossing after having seen thekm in so many animes and video games - guess what, they are rather underwhelming IRL but Shibuya is certainly impressive - then we wander around looking for some food before finding an outstanding gyoza place on the second floor. I didn’t know that you would get something this good in the middle of the tourist district. Only young locals were in there. Seeing a nice young lady dressed up like a cross between Joan Jett and Alice in Wonderland devouring gyoza while playing Switch all by herself was all I ever needed from this trip.\n\n30 ~Immersive Fort~ for me was excellent, the kind of thing you will only see in Japan. That said, I have been to other “immersive theater” events before (Phantom Peak in London) and the concept is similar - others have said the park feels a bit empty and it does. I was extremely impressed by the main event, The Sherlock - it took some getting used to, but what you do is follow actors around an IMMENSE area where so much effort has been put in, and you’re free to go where you like and discover the mystery out of order. Our audi guides worked well for the most part and we managed to follow most of the mystery - it plays out like one of the lesser Phoenix Wright cases, and being Japan, it of course had to have a little bit at the end that made the whole thing make no sense. I emailed them later for clarification, but they said that they wouldn’t tell! You would get more out of this park if you can speak Japanese, but would heavily recommend. ~Teamlab Planets~ was truly astounding. You can see what it’s like from the online imagery but you cannot comprehend the experience. I think nobody alive would not enjoy this. My wife had already been to the other one which I hear is “better” but it seems they’re different enough to justify either.\n\n31 ~Harajuku~ is essentially a mess. High end shopping streets (which are very nice if you like that) and then a load of touristy stuff stuffed up a single street. It sure has character though. The animal cafes will certainly be divisive. We went to the miipig cafe and the girls just basically bury you in pigs. It’s at this point we notice that the Japanese staff will basically not interact with you outside of basic business and they seem constantly uncomfortable being asked anything, which makes sense but we could have done with a bit of guidance than just having pigs thrown at us. ~Yoyogi Park~ I found truly impressive. Just the sheer size of it, it’s like being in another world. I’m tempted to wander off the path but my wife reminds me the forests are full of ghosts in Japan so I think better of it. We walk to ~Shinjuku~ in the blazing heat, looking for the bar Deathmatch in Hell, but we are simply too tired to continue past the station. Then the rain comes down and we didn’t bring the umbrella. We call it quits and go back to the hotel and then fall asleep almost immediately - at least my wife does because I spend every evening for the rest of the trip after she falls asleep enjoying random nonsense of Japanese TV together with a 9% whiskey highball or lemon sour. \n\n1 The airport food is delicious and the flights super efficient with no hassle. Everything in Japan runs on time to the second. We arrive in ~Sapporo~ and it has a friendly vibe around it. Tanukikoji is great. Again, just a great vibe and a lot of tourists from Asia, but not too crowded. We have another go in the arcades and enjoy a game of House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn and a few rounds of the drumming game. We even have a go of Sonic Blast Heroes because we’ve been doing some self defence classes in the gym but my wife hates it. She’s right, it was always lame. Everywhere is quite busy for food so we try the Bearfoot diner, all the staff are non-Japanese and speak English. You can see some fellow travellers are up for a chat, too- I’m not sure how great the food was compared to the rest of the top level stuff we’ve been having but there was something soothing about it. \n\n2 The ~Sapporo beer museum~ seems like it’s in the wrong part of town and it’s hellishly hot on the way there. Although it’s in a nice place, it’s tiny and contains almost nothing, and then is just a place to drink beers. We leave quickly and spend an hour wait for the sushi place by poking around a recycle store - the highlight is seeing a guy picking through the secondhand lolicon figures inspecting every one. The toriton sushi, strangely enough, does not actually have sushi on conveyor belts, just being a screen ordering place as usual but it’s absolutely outstanding. Totally exhausted and we check out ~AOAO (Sapporo aquarium)~ which is also in a great mall and I sample my first Hokkaido ice cream - how good is this Hokkaido milk really? The answer is ridiculously amazing. So creamy and somewhat cheesy even. The aquarium, we are not sure about at the start but turns out to be one of the trips’ highlights - so chilled and relaxing and the middle floor has an awesome collection of much lesser seen creatures. Only negative is the penguins on the top floor seem to be poorly housed and one of them has clearly gone insane, trying to drive itself relentlessly through the glass wall. Apart from that it’s awesome if not a little expensive and has some of the cuter souvenirs of the trip.\n\n3 After picking up the rail pass at the station: We go to have Jingiskhan at the ~TV tower~ with the locals. All the servers look really miserable, but the customers are having a great time. I’m familiar with korean BBQ but I find the rilled lamb especially amazing. We put some chinese cabbage on the grill for the second round and are immediately stopped by a terrified man who lets us know we have committed a fatal error, as politely as possible of course. The TV tower is surprisingly fun and full of merch that seems cute and unique but we will see repeated many times.  ~Maidreamin~ is certainly an experience. I see some people being super anti maid cafes but I would say there is no way you cannot go to one. The girls are terrified to see us but my god to they do their daman best to put on some kind of a show. Only other people in there are a group of guys having a birthday and an old man eating a full meal by himself. We get a Sexy lemon sour and a cute bear parfait that is enchanted by the 2 maids, I annoy and interrupt them at every turn, not on purpose of course, but they warm up towards the end. I suspect that a native Japanese would get a bit more value out of them as they’re supposed to do some “cute” things, one of them puts some glasses on at one point and that’s it. Altogether it was unmissable and the photo of them we have looking confused and bored will last until the end of time. Onto the ~University Museum,~ it’s a bit stuffy but in the best way, it really is a university museum and a great building, I would strongly recommend. We finish in the pop up beer garden, as with many things on the trip is seems impenetrable at first but the wonderful staff help us figure it out and it’s such a cool place to be, until the heavens open, the rain comes down and that’s the end of it. Watching the reaction of the locals is quite hilarious, some just stick it out under umbrellas, others are visibly trembling at the thought of their hair or loli costumes wet.\n\n4 ~Otaru~ is definitely worth a visit although it’s a bit like Japanese Blackpool. Many tourists but the canal cruise is great and the Birmingham accent English voice is priceless. The highlight of the trip is the street festival, everyone is in yukatas, there are people breaking out into sing song all over the town as the sun goers down and every stall is selling amazing street food including the local fried chicken, Zangi, which is ginger or saffron flavourerd, and the long fries, same as the milk - how good can Hokkaidan potatoes be? RIDICULOUS. So fluffy and crispy, you will have never encountered anything like this. We finish off with a concert from the local Christian church, it’s certainly high energy which is both bad and good.  \n\n5 On arriving in ~Asahikawa~ it's the first time we hit the “everything closed” for lunch problem. My cries to eat in the station fall on deaf ears (we find an amazing food court  there later!) and after much searching there’s a huge queue in Satan’s sun for the good ramen place - impossible for any non native. In the end we have an (amazing) meal in a fast food beef bowl chain. The tourist information at the station speak little to no English and direct us to the ~sake museum~ which like the beer museum is in the middle of nowhere. It is tiny, contains almost nothing, the staff hide from us and finally reveal you can buy sake but not drink it on the premises. We leave. That evening we go back to town and try an izakaya after two drunk guys spill out and make motions to tell us how good the food is - we sit right next to the grill and get some legendary food, amazing atmosphere and one staff speaks Engliush and waits on us like a personal butler. Sad that we weren’t allowed tip him!\n\n6 After some more detective work we book the tickets to the “Joyful” Nrokko train and it is indeed delightful. The countryside is lovely but it turns out the lavender and flowers are just a tiny area packed with tourists at ~Tomita lavender farm.~ Due to the heat and the small area there really isn;t much going on, we get back to the station only to find out we misread the time and have to stay another hour - the toilet attendant at the the temporary platform speaks no English but is again amazingly helpful. We decide to hit the pop up  ~beer garden~  at the station and eat a little item from every stall, it’s all amazing and I think one of the girls makes fun of me for ordering a lemon sour badly but that’s probably on me. The stall owners on the other hand are thrilled we’re ordering from them and it’s not too busy, overall a smash for the otherwise tiny Asahikawa.\n\n7 train to Sapporo and then on to ~Noboribetsu.~  For me Noboribetsu might have been the top highlight. We’re actually in Noboribetsu Onsen, basically a street of hotels and spas surrounded by forested mountains and covered in little Oni statues. Indeed, there are a lot of statues and a huge animatronic Enma, king of Hell, who puts on a little show where he turns into a demon - imagine if there was an animatronic Lucifer that turned into Satan in your home town. Jigokudani valley is indeed impressive if not a bit smelly, but the real highlight is our ryokan, Hard to put into words. The room is massive, the service like nothing on earth, and the absolutely massive Kaiseki dinner one of the greatest things I have ever eaten. The onsen I am unbsure about and it’s sad not to go in with the wife, and I get bored quite quickly but I do have to say that it was extremely refreshing and invigorating. The sleep is great too!\n\n8 I manage to misunderstand the bus and for no reason there’s no more for two hours. Date Jidaimura is a totally hilarious Edo themed park which turns out to be a blast - a yokai exhibit, goblin haunted house a ninja house and three (very similar) live shows. I love ninjas, so I’m on board, but I would have liked to see more ninja techniques rather than jumping about with some silly comedy, but despite the heat and the restaurant closing early I would heavily recommend it. We walk there and back and this is where the prasol saves out lives. It’s actually a very pleasant walk and I am super ready for another kaiseki - although I swear it’s not quite as good the second time around with a tiny bit less care put in. I think I offended one of the staff by puring drinks for us while she was serving, because a different server returns to the room. Oh well!\n\n9 And so to the last hokkaido stop, ~Hakodate.~ We get totally screwed by the early closing this time but find an extremely good ~craft beer~ place with outstanding tacos The owner speaks good English and is one of those guys just going on about his bar and business, but watching the whole crew help each other out is awesome. We are joined by some Japanese hipsters that question why they have to sit on beer barrels, just like you might in any hipster joint. The famous ~brick warehouses,~ are a bit of a let down and have some nice goods but nothing I would want or haven;t seen already. The beer hall is somewhat dingy and disappointing but we take the Blue Moon cruise at sunset exactly with a lemon sour in our hands and it’s utterly fantastic. Vistas are of limited interest to me but I cannot stress how amazing this was.\n\n10 Eating at the ~morning market,~ is every bit as good as I dreamed, a huge bowl of fresh raw seafood and a beer at 10am - I didn’t like seafood at all until a couple of years ago, now I am completely converted. We find the Mashumaru ship by accident and it turns out to be really fun and interesting, with lots of switches and buttons to flick that is fun for everyone and the whole museum is well put together too. A highlight. Back to the brick warehouses, they are still boring, and I convince the wife to eat at ~Lucky Pierrot~ which she was extremely resistant to - unfortunately it turns out to be quite weird and an odd taste and a strange, kitsch experience that would certainly appeal to some - unfortunately it does not go down well and we are forced to curse the clown’s name for evermore. One for weirdness enthusiasts and not hard to see why it hasn’t made it out of Hakodate. Overall Hakodate was a bit weird.\n\n11 And finally, down to ~Osaka~, now most people know what Osaka is like, I have to say after all the amazing experiences we’ve had I am not a huge fan - crowded bwyong belief, noisy, and I’m not convinced the food is that great. We drink too much and have a huge robust up over a mochi. I couldn’t say the takoyaki was really that amazing, to be honest. But you know what you’re getting here I guess.\n\n12 We settle our disputes at ~Kuromon~ which is much more chilled and have some top level sushi. Osaka is kind of weird. Not much more to say about it. We try to visit a cool looking horror experience in ~big step mall~ but are advised that we need to speak Japanese. At this point I only just trmemeber about using Google Translate to communicate, a bit late. We decide not to queue at the vegan okonomiyaki place with the other vegan-looking tourists and end up queuing for quite some time at another one but it is so worth it I cannot express it, if not for the hilarious banter between the staff, who clearly all fancy the same waitress. We walk back through the host bar district, which us foreigners will never get to experience, but from the outside looking in it just seems awesome and hilarious. How many girly-looking dudes can you fit into one district? All the girls touting whatever kind of bars exist there all look beyond fed up.\n\n13 The grand finale - ~Universal studios Japan .~ We get the twilight ticket from Lawson after much confusion. It then turns out you’re not guaranteed entry into Nintendo world with anything but the full price ticket - and of course we do not manage to acquire them. However the heat is so ridiculous I couldn’t image jumping around a Mario world. Everyone looks half dead. I can’t see how any kids are enjoying the experience. The park is impressive but as you have probably read, it is small, and the wait times for attractions just completely unfeasible. We do make it to the MHA 4D theater, and I have to say it’s a blast. I love seeing what they come up with for this kind of thing. The wife loves it too and has no idea who these characters are. I always find it odd that characters like Mickey Mouse are eternal because they have no “storyline” but animes do, and thus require a lot of explanation as to what point in the story these side-stories are set. It shouldn’t work, but it’s great. And so we finish off with the One Piece show, which is held in the Waterworld set -how is Waterworld still a thing? It’s 80 entire minutes, completely incomprehensible (although I think after watching one One Piece saga they’re all pretty similar) and I absolutely love it. How will they do Luffy’s stretchy arms, I wonder? They don’t. It’s all just pretend play. That said there’s a lot of love for the series and it is a great show, and it has a lot of heart! And the wife got to high five Luffy at the end, we even had Shanks make an appearance next to us even though he wasn’t in the story.\n\n14 Ok that’s enough Japan.\n\n",

I’m not sure it’s actually possible to eat badly. But I’ll mention when it was REALLY good.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The locals are beyond polite, especially if they’re paid to be -otherwise they kind of stay out of your way. Occasionally they look terrified if you ask them for help.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;As an anime fan it was lovely to see anime as part of the culture, but also somewhat sad to see how commercial it is compared to how edgy and cool one felt in 1996 watching it for the first time. Also as mentioned most things are all now related to mobile games and mainstream anime which I find quite boring.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;28 First thing we see on the airport train is a young man unconscious on the floor. I heard this happens to businessmen sometimes, but nobody checks he;s OK so I assume this is standard stuff. Happened enough times to a mate of mine, let’s just hope he survived. ~Don Quixote~ truly blew my mind upon first seeing it. So much silly stuff seemingly randomly placed. Bob Sapp CBD drinks. Bizarre alcohol. Utterly inappropriate anime figures. Even my little ADHD brain was a little overwhelmed. However we were utterly exhausted and didn’t buy anything. ~Taito station~ was disappointing given how little actual games there were (very few), but there were at least some machines, keeping my hope that arcades still live in some capacity. We didn’t have the cash with us, so we didn’t play anything. ~Overall Akihabara is a must see,~ but I was immediately struck with the feeling that at the age of 45 I didn’t want any of this stuff. I love anime but I don’t have space or the need for a million not that great collectibles. Most stuff is all the latest series (MHA, one piece, Genshin impact, honkai star rail) and nothing for classic animes or any of my obscure favourites, not even much Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure stuff. The gatcha machines and cranes are fun but I don’t know why the Japanese need floors and floors of it. I did want to go to the miad cafe, but there are so many it’s impossible to decide, so I left it till Sapporo where I heard the maids speak some English. Don Potato for me was a disappointment. If you’re a real retro collector, you might find some gems, but they’re all in Japanese and for me, I have a Retroid so don’t need any physical retro products. They’re not that cheap either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;29 Wake up late and check out the markets and shrine at ~Asakusa.~ The heat is beyond ridiculous. Overall its is lovely. We wish for something at a shrine but my wife won’t tell me what it is. Luckily, it;s a “good fortune.” We find an empty tonkatsu restaurant run by a little old man and the experience is amazing.  In the evening we check out Shibuya,I tick off the statue of Hachiko and scramble crossing after having seen thekm in so many animes and video games - guess what, they are rather underwhelming IRL but Shibuya is certainly impressive - then we wander around looking for some food before finding an outstanding gyoza place on the second floor. I didn’t know that you would get something this good in the middle of the tourist district. Only young locals were in there. Seeing a nice young lady dressed up like a cross between Joan Jett and Alice in Wonderland devouring gyoza while playing Switch all by herself was all I ever needed from this trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;30 ~Immersive Fort~ for me was excellent, the kind of thing you will only see in Japan. That said, I have been to other “immersive theater” events before (Phantom Peak in London) and the concept is similar - others have said the park feels a bit empty and it does. I was extremely impressed by the main event, The Sherlock - it took some getting used to, but what you do is follow actors around an IMMENSE area where so much effort has been put in, and you’re free to go where you like and discover the mystery out of order. Our audi guides worked well for the most part and we managed to follow most of the mystery - it plays out like one of the lesser Phoenix Wright cases, and being Japan, it of course had to have a little bit at the end that made the whole thing make no sense. I emailed them later for clarification, but they said that they wouldn’t tell! You would get more out of this park if you can speak Japanese, but would heavily recommend. ~Teamlab Planets~ was truly astounding. You can see what it’s like from the online imagery but you cannot comprehend the experience. I think nobody alive would not enjoy this. My wife had already been to the other one which I hear is “better” but it seems they’re different enough to justify either.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;31 ~Harajuku~ is essentially a mess. High end shopping streets (which are very nice if you like that) and then a load of touristy stuff stuffed up a single street. It sure has character though. The animal cafes will certainly be divisive. We went to the miipig cafe and the girls just basically bury you in pigs. It’s at this point we notice that the Japanese staff will basically not interact with you outside of basic business and they seem constantly uncomfortable being asked anything, which makes sense but we could have done with a bit of guidance than just having pigs thrown at us. ~Yoyogi Park~ I found truly impressive. Just the sheer size of it, it’s like being in another world. I’m tempted to wander off the path but my wife reminds me the forests are full of ghosts in Japan so I think better of it. We walk to ~Shinjuku~ in the blazing heat, looking for the bar Deathmatch in Hell, but we are simply too tired to continue past the station. Then the rain comes down and we didn’t bring the umbrella. We call it quits and go back to the hotel and then fall asleep almost immediately - at least my wife does because I spend every evening for the rest of the trip after she falls asleep enjoying random nonsense of Japanese TV together with a 9% whiskey highball or lemon sour. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 The airport food is delicious and the flights super efficient with no hassle. Everything in Japan runs on time to the second. We arrive in ~Sapporo~ and it has a friendly vibe around it. Tanukikoji is great. Again, just a great vibe and a lot of tourists from Asia, but not too crowded. We have another go in the arcades and enjoy a game of House of the Dead: Scarlet Dawn and a few rounds of the drumming game. We even have a go of Sonic Blast Heroes because we’ve been doing some self defence classes in the gym but my wife hates it. She’s right, it was always lame. Everywhere is quite busy for food so we try the Bearfoot diner, all the staff are non-Japanese and speak English. You can see some fellow travellers are up for a chat, too- I’m not sure how great the food was compared to the rest of the top level stuff we’ve been having but there was something soothing about it. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 The ~Sapporo beer museum~ seems like it’s in the wrong part of town and it’s hellishly hot on the way there. Although it’s in a nice place, it’s tiny and contains almost nothing, and then is just a place to drink beers. We leave quickly and spend an hour wait for the sushi place by poking around a recycle store - the highlight is seeing a guy picking through the secondhand lolicon figures inspecting every one. The toriton sushi, strangely enough, does not actually have sushi on conveyor belts, just being a screen ordering place as usual but it’s absolutely outstanding. Totally exhausted and we check out ~AOAO (Sapporo aquarium)~ which is also in a great mall and I sample my first Hokkaido ice cream - how good is this Hokkaido milk really? The answer is ridiculously amazing. So creamy and somewhat cheesy even. The aquarium, we are not sure about at the start but turns out to be one of the trips’ highlights - so chilled and relaxing and the middle floor has an awesome collection of much lesser seen creatures. Only negative is the penguins on the top floor seem to be poorly housed and one of them has clearly gone insane, trying to drive itself relentlessly through the glass wall. Apart from that it’s awesome if not a little expensive and has some of the cuter souvenirs of the trip.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3 After picking up the rail pass at the station: We go to have Jingiskhan at the ~TV tower~ with the locals. All the servers look really miserable, but the customers are having a great time. I’m familiar with korean BBQ but I find the rilled lamb especially amazing. We put some chinese cabbage on the grill for the second round and are immediately stopped by a terrified man who lets us know we have committed a fatal error, as politely as possible of course. The TV tower is surprisingly fun and full of merch that seems cute and unique but we will see repeated many times.  ~Maidreamin~ is certainly an experience. I see some people being super anti maid cafes but I would say there is no way you cannot go to one. The girls are terrified to see us but my god to they do their daman best to put on some kind of a show. Only other people in there are a group of guys having a birthday and an old man eating a full meal by himself. We get a Sexy lemon sour and a cute bear parfait that is enchanted by the 2 maids, I annoy and interrupt them at every turn, not on purpose of course, but they warm up towards the end. I suspect that a native Japanese would get a bit more value out of them as they’re supposed to do some “cute” things, one of them puts some glasses on at one point and that’s it. Altogether it was unmissable and the photo of them we have looking confused and bored will last until the end of time. Onto the ~University Museum,~ it’s a bit stuffy but in the best way, it really is a university museum and a great building, I would strongly recommend. We finish in the pop up beer garden, as with many things on the trip is seems impenetrable at first but the wonderful staff help us figure it out and it’s such a cool place to be, until the heavens open, the rain comes down and that’s the end of it. Watching the reaction of the locals is quite hilarious, some just stick it out under umbrellas, others are visibly trembling at the thought of their hair or loli costumes wet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4 ~Otaru~ is definitely worth a visit although it’s a bit like Japanese Blackpool. Many tourists but the canal cruise is great and the Birmingham accent English voice is priceless. The highlight of the trip is the street festival, everyone is in yukatas, there are people breaking out into sing song all over the town as the sun goers down and every stall is selling amazing street food including the local fried chicken, Zangi, which is ginger or saffron flavourerd, and the long fries, same as the milk - how good can Hokkaidan potatoes be? RIDICULOUS. So fluffy and crispy, you will have never encountered anything like this. We finish off with a concert from the local Christian church, it’s certainly high energy which is both bad and good.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 On arriving in ~Asahikawa~ it&amp;#39;s the first time we hit the “everything closed” for lunch problem. My cries to eat in the station fall on deaf ears (we find an amazing food court  there later!) and after much searching there’s a huge queue in Satan’s sun for the good ramen place - impossible for any non native. In the end we have an (amazing) meal in a fast food beef bowl chain. The tourist information at the station speak little to no English and direct us to the ~sake museum~ which like the beer museum is in the middle of nowhere. It is tiny, contains almost nothing, the staff hide from us and finally reveal you can buy sake but not drink it on the premises. We leave. That evening we go back to town and try an izakaya after two drunk guys spill out and make motions to tell us how good the food is - we sit right next to the grill and get some legendary food, amazing atmosphere and one staff speaks Engliush and waits on us like a personal butler. Sad that we weren’t allowed tip him!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6 After some more detective work we book the tickets to the “Joyful” Nrokko train and it is indeed delightful. The countryside is lovely but it turns out the lavender and flowers are just a tiny area packed with tourists at ~Tomita lavender farm.~ Due to the heat and the small area there really isn;t much going on, we get back to the station only to find out we misread the time and have to stay another hour - the toilet attendant at the the temporary platform speaks no English but is again amazingly helpful. We decide to hit the pop up  ~beer garden~  at the station and eat a little item from every stall, it’s all amazing and I think one of the girls makes fun of me for ordering a lemon sour badly but that’s probably on me. The stall owners on the other hand are thrilled we’re ordering from them and it’s not too busy, overall a smash for the otherwise tiny Asahikawa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7 train to Sapporo and then on to ~Noboribetsu.~  For me Noboribetsu might have been the top highlight. We’re actually in Noboribetsu Onsen, basically a street of hotels and spas surrounded by forested mountains and covered in little Oni statues. Indeed, there are a lot of statues and a huge animatronic Enma, king of Hell, who puts on a little show where he turns into a demon - imagine if there was an animatronic Lucifer that turned into Satan in your home town. Jigokudani valley is indeed impressive if not a bit smelly, but the real highlight is our ryokan, Hard to put into words. The room is massive, the service like nothing on earth, and the absolutely massive Kaiseki dinner one of the greatest things I have ever eaten. The onsen I am unbsure about and it’s sad not to go in with the wife, and I get bored quite quickly but I do have to say that it was extremely refreshing and invigorating. The sleep is great too!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;8 I manage to misunderstand the bus and for no reason there’s no more for two hours. Date Jidaimura is a totally hilarious Edo themed park which turns out to be a blast - a yokai exhibit, goblin haunted house a ninja house and three (very similar) live shows. I love ninjas, so I’m on board, but I would have liked to see more ninja techniques rather than jumping about with some silly comedy, but despite the heat and the restaurant closing early I would heavily recommend it. We walk there and back and this is where the prasol saves out lives. It’s actually a very pleasant walk and I am super ready for another kaiseki - although I swear it’s not quite as good the second time around with a tiny bit less care put in. I think I offended one of the staff by puring drinks for us while she was serving, because a different server returns to the room. Oh well!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;9 And so to the last hokkaido stop, ~Hakodate.~ We get totally screwed by the early closing this time but find an extremely good ~craft beer~ place with outstanding tacos The owner speaks good English and is one of those guys just going on about his bar and business, but watching the whole crew help each other out is awesome. We are joined by some Japanese hipsters that question why they have to sit on beer barrels, just like you might in any hipster joint. The famous ~brick warehouses,~ are a bit of a let down and have some nice goods but nothing I would want or haven;t seen already. The beer hall is somewhat dingy and disappointing but we take the Blue Moon cruise at sunset exactly with a lemon sour in our hands and it’s utterly fantastic. Vistas are of limited interest to me but I cannot stress how amazing this was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;10 Eating at the ~morning market,~ is every bit as good as I dreamed, a huge bowl of fresh raw seafood and a beer at 10am - I didn’t like seafood at all until a couple of years ago, now I am completely converted. We find the Mashumaru ship by accident and it turns out to be really fun and interesting, with lots of switches and buttons to flick that is fun for everyone and the whole museum is well put together too. A highlight. Back to the brick warehouses, they are still boring, and I convince the wife to eat at ~Lucky Pierrot~ which she was extremely resistant to - unfortunately it turns out to be quite weird and an odd taste and a strange, kitsch experience that would certainly appeal to some - unfortunately it does not go down well and we are forced to curse the clown’s name for evermore. One for weirdness enthusiasts and not hard to see why it hasn’t made it out of Hakodate. Overall Hakodate was a bit weird.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;11 And finally, down to ~Osaka~, now most people know what Osaka is like, I have to say after all the amazing experiences we’ve had I am not a huge fan - crowded bwyong belief, noisy, and I’m not convinced the food is that great. We drink too much and have a huge robust up over a mochi. I couldn’t say the takoyaki was really that amazing, to be honest. But you know what you’re getting here I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;12 We settle our disputes at ~Kuromon~ which is much more chilled and have some top level sushi. Osaka is kind of weird. Not much more to say about it. We try to visit a cool looking horror experience in ~big step mall~ but are advised that we need to speak Japanese. At this point I only just trmemeber about using Google Translate to communicate, a bit late. We decide not to queue at the vegan okonomiyaki place with the other vegan-looking tourists and end up queuing for quite some time at another one but it is so worth it I cannot express it, if not for the hilarious banter between the staff, who clearly all fancy the same waitress. We walk back through the host bar district, which us foreigners will never get to experience, but from the outside looking in it just seems awesome and hilarious. How many girly-looking dudes can you fit into one district? All the girls touting whatever kind of bars exist there all look beyond fed up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;13 The grand finale - ~Universal studios Japan .~ We get the twilight ticket from Lawson after much confusion. It then turns out you’re not guaranteed entry into Nintendo world with anything but the full price ticket - and of course we do not manage to acquire them. However the heat is so ridiculous I couldn’t image jumping around a Mario world. Everyone looks half dead. I can’t see how any kids are enjoying the experience. The park is impressive but as you have probably read, it is small, and the wait times for attractions just completely unfeasible. We do make it to the MHA 4D theater, and I have to say it’s a blast. I love seeing what they come up with for this kind of thing. The wife loves it too and has no idea who these characters are. I always find it odd that characters like Mickey Mouse are eternal because they have no “storyline” but animes do, and thus require a lot of explanation as to what point in the story these side-stories are set. It shouldn’t work, but it’s great. And so we finish off with the One Piece show, which is held in the Waterworld set -how is Waterworld still a thing? It’s 80 entire minutes, completely incomprehensible (although I think after watching one One Piece saga they’re all pretty similar) and I absolutely love it. How will they do Luffy’s stretchy arms, I wonder? They don’t. It’s all just pretend play. That said there’s a lot of love for the series and it is a great show, and it has a lot of heart! And the wife got to high five Luffy at the end, we even had Shanks make an appearance next to us even though he wasn’t in the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;14 Ok that’s enough Japan.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Boycott Kohler for not supporting small business.  \nUse Website In a Screen-Reader Mode\nAccessibility Screen-Reader Guide, Feedback, and Issue Reporting\nSkip to Content\n\n\nSelect Language\nMENU\nSEARCH\n\n\nKohler Unveils State-of-the-Art Manufacturing Facility in Casa Grande, AZ Creating 400 Full-Time Jobs\nCutting-edge greenfield plant produces STERLING brand bathing and showering products to meet growing demand and enhance customer experience\n\nKOHLER, Wis. – May 15, 2024 – Kohler Co., a global leader in kitchen and bath products headquartered in Kohler, Wisconsin, officially opened the doors to its new manufacturing facility in Casa Grande, Arizona, with a ceremonial ribbon-cutting event hosted by company leadership. Among those in attendance were Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, some of the new Kohler associates filling more than 400 full-time administrative and production positions, state and local officials, and Kohler customers.\n\nThe facility produces STERLING brand bath and shower fixtures and is approximately one million square feet on 216 acres with room for future expansion. The multi-million dollar capital investment features an innovative manufacturing facility, ancillary warehouse, distribution center, office space, and cafeterias. The site also includes a best-in-class showroom for customers and visitors to view leading-edge products.\n\n“Arizona is a recognized hub of excellence for manufacturing, innovation, and sustainability, all of which are enhanced by the addition of Kohler’s new state-of-the-art facility,” said Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs. “As one of the world’s most recognized brands known for its commitment to sustainability and innovation, Kohler strengthens Arizona’s rapidly growing manufacturing industry.”\n\n“We welcome our new associates to Kohler Co. and look forward to being an active participant in the greater Casa Grande community, contributing to its growing economy and quality of life, providing good-paying jobs and benefits, and offering opportunities for career development and advancement,” said Norbert Schmidt, President-Kitchen &amp; Bath North America for Kohler. “The new plant provides the capacity to support our strong growth projections for STERLING to better serve our customers with the highest level of quality and delivery. We thank our loyal customers and partners who have been crucial in helping to build our STERLING business to what it is today.”\n\nThe plant incorporates smart factory elements and production technology that create durable and stylish baths, shower receptors, and bath/shower walls. The company will also track key sustainability measures to minimize greenhouse gas emissions, water use, solid waste, as well as energy efficiency.\n\nIn March, Kohler was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations to begin award negotiations for up to $51.2 million, matched by company investment, to demonstrate a commercial scale decarbonization solution at the Casa Grande plant.\n\nKohler is pursuing an electric boiler and microgrid system and expects the upgrades to prevent at least 7,865 MT CO2e from being released annually. This represents a reduction of at least 90% of the pressing process emissions by eliminating CO2e emissions from natural gas boilers. Kohler will incorporate electric boilers, install a 21MW solar array microgrid, utilize long-duration energy storage (LDES) batteries with 68MWh of storage, and install 12MW of HVO-capable KOHLER industrial backup generators. The LDES batteries coupled with advanced microgrid controls eliminate all possible solar curtailment scenarios and enable the facility to run the boilers on renewable energy while performing solar smoothing, thereby reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAdditionally in 2023, Kohler supported a multi-year project led by Bonneville Environmental Foundation, Arizona State University, and Bridgestone to convert high water use crops to low water use crops to alleviate water stress on the local aquifers.\n\n“The City of Casa Grande welcomes Kohler Company with open arms and is pleased that the organization has invested in us for the long-term. A global force in kitchen and bath, Kohler has established itself as a highly successful forward-thinking organization that cares for and contributes to its local communities,” said Craig McFarland, Mayor of Casa Grande. “We are proud to have Kohler as an integral member of our community.”\n\n“Kohler’s new facility is a significant win for Casa Grande and Arizona,” said Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “Kohler’s sustainable manufacturing facility showcases Arizona’s attractiveness as a premier global destination for advanced manufacturing. We’re grateful an iconic company like Kohler is investing in our state while creating hundreds of skilled jobs in rural Arizona.”\n\n“In opening this massive factory in Casa Grande, Kohler is capitalizing on the advantages Greater Phoenix offers in serving its customer base in the western U.S.,” said Chris Camacho, Greater Phoenix Economic Council President &amp; CEO. “This globally recognized brand has found a home for manufacturing, warehousing and of and we’re thrilled to officially welcome them into  approximately 1 million square feet, with room for future expansion, and will bring more than 400 new full-time jobs to the local market. The ceremony was attended by Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, Kohler Chair and CEO David Kohler, company leaders and associates, state and local officials, and Kohler customers.\n\nParticipating in the ribbon cutting were:  (left to right) Tracy Jaeger, VP &amp; GM of Bathing &amp; Showering – Kohler Co.; John Bishopp, Plant Manager – Kohler Co.; Casa Grande Mayor Craig McFarland; Governor Katie Hobbs; David Kohler, Chair &amp; CEO of Kohler Co.; Laura Kohler, Chief Sustainable Living Officer – Kohler Co.; Norb Schmidt, President of Kitchen &amp; Bath North America – Kohler Co.; Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority; Heath Holtz, Chief Operations &amp; Supply Chain Officer – Kohler Co.; and David Mortenson, Chairman – Mortensen.\n\n\nTodd Weber\nCommunications Director-PR\n920-457-4441, ext. 72707\ntodd.weber@kohler.com \n\n\nStephen Maliszewski\nDirector-PR                                                                  \n920-457-4441, ext. 70725\n",

Among those in attendance were Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, some of the new Kohler associates filling more than 400 full-time administrative and production positions, state and local officials, and Kohler customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The facility produces STERLING brand bath and shower fixtures and is approximately one million square feet on 216 acres with room for future expansion. The multi-million dollar capital investment features an innovative manufacturing facility, ancillary warehouse, distribution center, office space, and cafeterias. The site also includes a best-in-class showroom for customers and visitors to view leading-edge products.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Arizona is a recognized hub of excellence for manufacturing, innovation, and sustainability, all of which are enhanced by the addition of Kohler’s new state-of-the-art facility,” said Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs. “As one of the world’s most recognized brands known for its commitment to sustainability and innovation, Kohler strengthens Arizona’s rapidly growing manufacturing industry.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We welcome our new associates to Kohler Co. and look forward to being an active participant in the greater Casa Grande community, contributing to its growing economy and quality of life, providing good-paying jobs and benefits, and offering opportunities for career development and advancement,” said Norbert Schmidt, President-Kitchen &amp;amp; Bath North America for Kohler. “The new plant provides the capacity to support our strong growth projections for STERLING to better serve our customers with the highest level of quality and delivery. We thank our loyal customers and partners who have been crucial in helping to build our STERLING business to what it is today.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The plant incorporates smart factory elements and production technology that create durable and stylish baths, shower receptors, and bath/shower walls. The company will also track key sustainability measures to minimize greenhouse gas emissions, water use, solid waste, as well as energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In March, Kohler was selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations to begin award negotiations for up to $51.2 million, matched by company investment, to demonstrate a commercial scale decarbonization solution at the Casa Grande plant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kohler is pursuing an electric boiler and microgrid system and expects the upgrades to prevent at least 7,865 MT CO2e from being released annually. This represents a reduction of at least 90% of the pressing process emissions by eliminating CO2e emissions from natural gas boilers. Kohler will incorporate electric boilers, install a 21MW solar array microgrid, utilize long-duration energy storage (LDES) batteries with 68MWh of storage, and install 12MW of HVO-capable KOHLER industrial backup generators. The LDES batteries coupled with advanced microgrid controls eliminate all possible solar curtailment scenarios and enable the facility to run the boilers on renewable energy while performing solar smoothing, thereby reducing carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Additionally in 2023, Kohler supported a multi-year project led by Bonneville Environmental Foundation, Arizona State University, and Bridgestone to convert high water use crops to low water use crops to alleviate water stress on the local aquifers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The City of Casa Grande welcomes Kohler Company with open arms and is pleased that the organization has invested in us for the long-term. A global force in kitchen and bath, Kohler has established itself as a highly successful forward-thinking organization that cares for and contributes to its local communities,” said Craig McFarland, Mayor of Casa Grande. “We are proud to have Kohler as an integral member of our community.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Kohler’s new facility is a significant win for Casa Grande and Arizona,” said Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “Kohler’s sustainable manufacturing facility showcases Arizona’s attractiveness as a premier global destination for advanced manufacturing. We’re grateful an iconic company like Kohler is investing in our state while creating hundreds of skilled jobs in rural Arizona.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“In opening this massive factory in Casa Grande, Kohler is capitalizing on the advantages Greater Phoenix offers in serving its customer base in the western U.S.,” said Chris Camacho, Greater Phoenix Economic Council President &amp;amp; CEO. “This globally recognized brand has found a home for manufacturing, warehousing and of and we’re thrilled to officially welcome them into  approximately 1 million square feet, with room for future expansion, and will bring more than 400 new full-time jobs to the local market. The ceremony was attended by Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs, Kohler Chair and CEO David Kohler, company leaders and associates, state and local officials, and Kohler customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Participating in the ribbon cutting were:  (left to right) Tracy Jaeger, VP &amp;amp; GM of Bathing &amp;amp; Showering – Kohler Co.; John Bishopp, Plant Manager – Kohler Co.; Casa Grande Mayor Craig McFarland; Governor Katie Hobbs; David Kohler, Chair &amp;amp; CEO of Kohler Co.; Laura Kohler, Chief Sustainable Living Officer – Kohler Co.; Norb Schmidt, President of Kitchen &amp;amp; Bath North America – Kohler Co.; Sandra Watson, President and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority; Heath Holtz, Chief Operations &amp;amp; Supply Chain Officer – Kohler Co.; and David Mortenson, Chairman – Mortensen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Todd Weber\nCommunications Director-PR\n920-457-4441, ext. 72707\n&lt;a href=\"mailto:todd.weber@kohler.com\"&gt;todd.weber@kohler.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stephen Maliszewski\nDirector-PR&lt;br/&gt;\n920-457-4441, ext. 70725&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

In doing so, the BSP said that inflationary risks “continue to lean toward the upside”, but that its latest forecasts showed that “inflation would settle close tot he upper-end of the target range.” As for inflation expectations, the BSP said that those “remain well-anchored”. The Monetary Board said that it “deems it appropriate to ensure tight monetary policy settings until inflation settles firmly within the target range”, and indicated that such a stance would also “help keep inflation expectations anchored”.\r\n&gt;    - ***MB:*** *At least the BSP stopped talking about wage increases as a potential inflationary risk. That said, does anyone else detect an air of contradiction in what the BSP is saying? Perhaps contradiction is too strong of a term, but I get the growing sense that the BSP’s reasons for keeping rates high are somewhat diverging from its own analysis. The BSP says that it’s primary objective is price stability, so we can infer that it’s keeping rates high as a means of trying to suppress price increases, and yet the BSP has again and again told us that the driver for price increases is a problem on the supply side of the equation, not the demand side. Interest rate adjustments don’t impact supply-side problems, because interest rate increases are meant to suppress demand. We don’t have a demand problem. Adding to this is the BSP’s concern about maintaining a tight policy to keep inflation expectations anchored, despite noting just a paragraph earlier that inflation expectations were already “well-anchored”. This implies that there is psychological space for the BSP to lower rates within the framework of current expectations. This is picky stuff, I know, there are simply too many people and companies struggling under high rates to ignore the rapidly decreasing marginal utility of yet another cycle of the BSP’s conservative observation of the situation. Just my personal opinion.*\r\n\r\n&gt;- **[DIVS]  DDMPR declares falling Q1 div at 116% payout ratio...** **DDMP** [DDMPR 1.17 ▲0.9%; 37% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=24d21354554a32ceabca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] declared a Q1/24 dividend of ₱0.023476, payable on July 15 to shareholders of record as of June 19. The dividend has an annualized yield of 8.03% based on the previous closing price. The total amount of the dividend is ₱419 million, which is 116% of the ₱362 million in distributable income that DDMPR reported for the quarter. Relative to DDMPR’s IPO price, the dividend increased DDMPR’s total stock and dividend return to -32.29%, up from its pre-dividend total return of -32.33%. DDMP REIT Fund Managers reported that DDMPR’s occupancy as of March 31 was just 76%, with occupancy at its main building (DoubleDragon Plaza) listed at just 70.8%.\r\n&gt;    - ***MB:*** *The dividend amount is up 1.4% from DDMPR’s disastrous Q4/23 dividend, but it’s down 7.5% y/y and down 15.8% from Q1/22. DDMPR is the second-oldest REIT on the PSE. It issued its first dividend to shareholders in Q4/20. Its sponsor,**DoubleDragon** [DD 10.48 ▲10.0%; 581% avgVol], is bursting at the seams with potential assets that could be downloaded to DDMPR to diversify the REIT’s portfolio and breathe some much-needed life into this stagnating afterthought. DDMPR’s assets are fine, but their strategy in how to monetize those assets is outdated. Gone are the days when high commercial rents from POGOs could excuse the growing issue of collections from those POGOs. Now we have DDMPR suffering from high (and going higher) rates of delinquency. Gone are the days when investors were lapping up the chance to get in on the commercial office space game. Now we have the threat of a POGO ban and the existential threat of AI putting all of the “easy” BPO leasing opportunities at risk. Gone are the days when DDMPR’s inactivity could be explained away by its newness. Now we’re left picking through the rubble of yet another disappointing Quarterly Report, yet another y/y dividend reduction, and bagholders have heard no plan from management on what they’ll do to right the ship.*\r\n\r\n&gt;- **[EARNINGS]  Jollibee Q1 profit: ₱2.6-B (up 27%)...** Jollibee [JFC 224.00 ▲0.9%; 300% avgVol] [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=6528c13d00970d0cabca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] posted a Q1 net income attributable of ₱2.6 billion, up 27% from its Q1/23 net income attributable of ₱2.1 billion. JFC said it was able to grow profit margins and exceed its Q1 performance outlook thanks to “healthy top line growth combined with further operational efficiencies and effective management of expenses”. JFC’s system-wide sales were up 10.4% to ₱86.8 billion due to new store additions and same-store sales growth was up 5.5%, which JFC said was due to increased volume. Across all of JFC’s segmented business units, “Europe, Middle East, Asia” had the largest same-store sales growth (+14.7%) and system-wide sales growth (+25.5%). The “People’s Republic of China” and “Highlands Coffee” were negative in terms of same-store sales growth (-3.7% and -9.0%, respectively), and only the People’s Republic of China business unit was negative in terms of system-wide sales growth (-3.7%). JFC said that its difficulties in China are partly due to a high bar effect from last year’s success, and a slowdown in the quick service restaurant industry in that country more generally. JFC said that while Highlands Coffee saw its same-store sales growth fall 9.0%, it did “better than industry” and managed to gain 4% market share during that period.\r\n&gt;    - ***MB:*** *The bee perseveres. It has made massive bets in “coffee” and “China” that could pay off handsomely in the future, and all of this activity has likely bought the management team some more time with its shareholder base to deliver on the delicious fruits of these bets. JFC’s stock price is up almost 150% from its COVID low, but it’s somewhat rangebound between about ₱200/share and ₱270/share. The stock hit ₱273/share in late February, only to rapidly retreat back to the ₱215/share level over the next six weeks in a pattern that the share price has repeated two or three times already this year. Generally speaking, the highs are higher and the lows are higher, but maybe with all the segments firing this busy season the stock will finally be able to push out of that range.*\r\n\r\n&gt;- **[NEWS]  Several notable firms placed on suspension notice for failure to report...** The **PSE** [[link](https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=ffee2352ff1f8323abca0fa0c5b4e4d0)] notified four high-profile companies that their shares would be suspended at 9 AM today if 2023 Annual Reports were not posted. The companies that were put on notice are **Tony Tiu’s AgriNurture** [ANI 0.57 ▼1.7%; 102% avgVol], **Philippine Infradev** [INFRA 0.53 ▲1.9%; 262% avgVol] and two from pseudo-tycoon **Dennis Uy, Chelsea Logistics** [C 1.30 ▲4.0%; 526% avgVol] and **Phoenix Petroleum** [PNX 4.17 ▼0.2%; 78% avgVol]. Should any of these companies fail to submit their Annual Reports before 9 AM, they will remain suspended for up to three months until such report is submitted. If nothing has changed after three months, the PSE must begin involuntary delisting proceedings.\r\n&gt;    - ***MB:*** *These companies are not a random sample, and they’re not representative of the PSE as a whole. Will ANI, INFRA, C, and PNX push their luck right up to the deadline, or will any of these companies slip into a suspended state for failure to complete one of the most basic components of public corporate life? As usual, retail bagholders will just have to wait and see what the owners decide to do.*\r\n\r\n**MB** is written and distributed every trading day.

In doing so, the BSP said that inflationary risks “continue to lean toward the upside”, but that its latest forecasts showed that “inflation would settle close tot he upper-end of the target range.” As for inflation expectations, the BSP said that those “remain well-anchored”. The Monetary Board said that it “deems it appropriate to ensure tight monetary policy settings until inflation settles firmly within the target range”, and indicated that such a stance would also “help keep inflation expectations anchored”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MB:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;At least the BSP stopped talking about wage increases as a potential inflationary risk. That said, does anyone else detect an air of contradiction in what the BSP is saying? Perhaps contradiction is too strong of a term, but I get the growing sense that the BSP’s reasons for keeping rates high are somewhat diverging from its own analysis. The BSP says that it’s primary objective is price stability, so we can infer that it’s keeping rates high as a means of trying to suppress price increases, and yet the BSP has again and again told us that the driver for price increases is a problem on the supply side of the equation, not the demand side. Interest rate adjustments don’t impact supply-side problems, because interest rate increases are meant to suppress demand. We don’t have a demand problem. Adding to this is the BSP’s concern about maintaining a tight policy to keep inflation expectations anchored, despite noting just a paragraph earlier that inflation expectations were already “well-anchored”. This implies that there is psychological space for the BSP to lower rates within the framework of current expectations. This is picky stuff, I know, there are simply too many people and companies struggling under high rates to ignore the rapidly decreasing marginal utility of yet another cycle of the BSP’s conservative observation of the situation. Just my personal opinion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[DIVS]  DDMPR declares falling Q1 div at 116% payout ratio...&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;DDMP&lt;/strong&gt; [DDMPR 1.17 ▲0.9%; 37% avgVol] [&lt;a href=\"https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=24d21354554a32ceabca0fa0c5b4e4d0\"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;] declared a Q1/24 dividend of ₱0.023476, payable on July 15 to shareholders of record as of June 19. The dividend has an annualized yield of 8.03% based on the previous closing price. The total amount of the dividend is ₱419 million, which is 116% of the ₱362 million in distributable income that DDMPR reported for the quarter. Relative to DDMPR’s IPO price, the dividend increased DDMPR’s total stock and dividend return to -32.29%, up from its pre-dividend total return of -32.33%. DDMP REIT Fund Managers reported that DDMPR’s occupancy as of March 31 was just 76%, with occupancy at its main building (DoubleDragon Plaza) listed at just 70.8%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MB:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The dividend amount is up 1.4% from DDMPR’s disastrous Q4/23 dividend, but it’s down 7.5% y/y and down 15.8% from Q1/22. DDMPR is the second-oldest REIT on the PSE. It issued its first dividend to shareholders in Q4/20. Its sponsor,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;DoubleDragon&lt;/em&gt;* [DD 10.48 ▲10.0%; 581% avgVol], is bursting at the seams with potential assets that could be downloaded to DDMPR to diversify the REIT’s portfolio and breathe some much-needed life into this stagnating afterthought. DDMPR’s assets are fine, but their strategy in how to monetize those assets is outdated. Gone are the days when high commercial rents from POGOs could excuse the growing issue of collections from those POGOs. Now we have DDMPR suffering from high (and going higher) rates of delinquency. Gone are the days when investors were lapping up the chance to get in on the commercial office space game. Now we have the threat of a POGO ban and the existential threat of AI putting all of the “easy” BPO leasing opportunities at risk. Gone are the days when DDMPR’s inactivity could be explained away by its newness. Now we’re left picking through the rubble of yet another disappointing Quarterly Report, yet another y/y dividend reduction, and bagholders have heard no plan from management on what they’ll do to right the ship.*&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[EARNINGS]  Jollibee Q1 profit: ₱2.6-B (up 27%)...&lt;/strong&gt; Jollibee [JFC 224.00 ▲0.9%; 300% avgVol] [&lt;a href=\"https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=6528c13d00970d0cabca0fa0c5b4e4d0\"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;] posted a Q1 net income attributable of ₱2.6 billion, up 27% from its Q1/23 net income attributable of ₱2.1 billion. JFC said it was able to grow profit margins and exceed its Q1 performance outlook thanks to “healthy top line growth combined with further operational efficiencies and effective management of expenses”. JFC’s system-wide sales were up 10.4% to ₱86.8 billion due to new store additions and same-store sales growth was up 5.5%, which JFC said was due to increased volume. Across all of JFC’s segmented business units, “Europe, Middle East, Asia” had the largest same-store sales growth (+14.7%) and system-wide sales growth (+25.5%). The “People’s Republic of China” and “Highlands Coffee” were negative in terms of same-store sales growth (-3.7% and -9.0%, respectively), and only the People’s Republic of China business unit was negative in terms of system-wide sales growth (-3.7%). JFC said that its difficulties in China are partly due to a high bar effect from last year’s success, and a slowdown in the quick service restaurant industry in that country more generally. JFC said that while Highlands Coffee saw its same-store sales growth fall 9.0%, it did “better than industry” and managed to gain 4% market share during that period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MB:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;The bee perseveres. It has made massive bets in “coffee” and “China” that could pay off handsomely in the future, and all of this activity has likely bought the management team some more time with its shareholder base to deliver on the delicious fruits of these bets. JFC’s stock price is up almost 150% from its COVID low, but it’s somewhat rangebound between about ₱200/share and ₱270/share. The stock hit ₱273/share in late February, only to rapidly retreat back to the ₱215/share level over the next six weeks in a pattern that the share price has repeated two or three times already this year. Generally speaking, the highs are higher and the lows are higher, but maybe with all the segments firing this busy season the stock will finally be able to push out of that range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[NEWS]  Several notable firms placed on suspension notice for failure to report...&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;PSE&lt;/strong&gt; [&lt;a href=\"https://edge.pse.com.ph/openDiscViewer.do?edge_no=ffee2352ff1f8323abca0fa0c5b4e4d0\"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;] notified four high-profile companies that their shares would be suspended at 9 AM today if 2023 Annual Reports were not posted.

Should any of these companies fail to submit their Annual Reports before 9 AM, they will remain suspended for up to three months until such report is submitted. If nothing has changed after three months, the PSE must begin involuntary delisting proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MB:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;These companies are not a random sample, and they’re not representative of the PSE as a whole. Will ANI, INFRA, C, and PNX push their luck right up to the deadline, or will any of these companies slip into a suspended state for failure to complete one of the most basic components of public corporate life? As usual, retail bagholders will just have to wait and see what the owners decide to do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MB&lt;/strong&gt; is written and distributed every trading day.

Michigan’s first urban state park, popular cultural attractions, and new residences and businesses continue to expand in this formerly industrial section of the city. The Detroit River Conservancy estimates $275 million have already been invested along the riverfront with an additional $1 billion expected to be invested in the next decade.\n\nMichigan Department of Natural Resources Outdoor Adventure Center\n\nLocated on Detroit’s riverfront in the historic Globe Building, the Outdoor Adventure Center, or OAC, gives Detroit residents a taste of Michigan’s great outdoors in the heart of the city. In 2016, its first full year of operation,  the OAC saw 100,000 visitors.\n\nA $15 million renovation revitalized this former dry dock. The Globe Building had an important role in Great Lakes maritime history as a manufacturer of marine steam engines for freight and passenger vessels. Henry Ford worked at Detroit Dry Dock Engine Works from 1880-1882 as an apprentice machinist, learning the skills associated with his first love, steam-powered engines.\n\nThe city of Detroit made the first investment in the OAC project using $200,000 from the Brownfields Assessment and Cleanup Grant Program to remove contaminated soils on the site.\n\n20 Jobs Created\n$15 Million Redevelopment Investment\n\nOrleans Landing\n\nConstruction is near completion on the $65 million, 270-apartment Orleans Landing complex. Located immediately next to the Outdoor Adventure Center, the 270 unit Orleans Landing Apartments gives Detroiters the opportunity to enjoy the redeveloped neighborhood.  When completed in 2017, the development represented the first market-rate residential construction project on Detroit’s East Riverfront in 25 years. An EPA Brownfields Assessment and Cleanup Grant to the Detroit Wayne County Port Authority, or DWCPA, funded the environmental investigation needed to demonstrate the feasibility of residential construction on the site.\n\n33 Jobs Created\n$61 Million Redevelopment Reinvestment\n\nDetroit Elevator Building\n\nOnce an old warehouse, the Elevator Building has been redeveloped into loft-style office space for small businesses. An EPA Brownfields Assessment and Cleanup Grant to the DWCPA was used to identify hazardous materials that were subsequently managed during building renovations.\n\n2 Jobs Created\n\nDetroit Riverwalk\n\nThe riverfront was mainly an industrial and warehouse district for most of the 19th and 20th centuries. Now, more than 3 million people a year use the Detroit RiverWalk, the pedestrian/bike path that runs along the river from Belle Isle to Rosa Parks Boulevard. It’s one of downtown’s most popular attractions. The DWCPA conducted the necessary environmental investigations using its EPA Brownfields Assessment and Cleanup Grant Program funding.\n\nPiquette Square\n\nFormerly the site of an abandon Studebaker plant, the Piquette Square development in Detroit provides 150 apartments to house and care for homeless veterans. In addition to shelter, the project offers space for a wide range of support services to help veterans develop self-sufficiency to reintegrate into the community. Southwest Housing Solutions developed and manages the facility which opened for occupancy in June 2010.\n\nThe project’s success required financial assistance from numerous government agencies and charitable organizations. U.S. EPA’s Brownfields Assessment and Cleanup Grant Program provided the funds needed to investigate and remediate contamination resulting from the sites industrial past and the fire which destroyed the Studebaker plant. The Detroit Wayne County Port Authority, or DWCPA, used part of its Brownfields Assessment and Cleanup Grant to evaluate the nature and extent of environmental problems at the site. Then, the Wayne County Brownfield Redevelopment Agency provided a loan from its brownfield revolving loan fund to Southwest Solutions to clean up contaminated soils, remove underground storage tanks, and install a vapor intrusion barrier.\n\nConstruction of the $23 million facility was financed by tax credits, bond funds, a state program to end chronic homelessness, and other various grants. U.S. EPA’s Brownfields Assessment and Cleanup Grant Program funding was particularly important as it was the only source of project money available for environmental investigation and cleanup. \n\nNotable Project Features:\n\n    Redevelopment of abandon auto facility\n    EPA funding provided by two different grantees working cooperatively\n    Overcame state housing agency concerns about developing residential use on formerly contaminated property.\n     Winner of 2011 Phoenix Award for Brownfield Redevelopment\n\nCardinal Health Medical Warehouse\n\nA $1 million Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund grant to the DWCPA figured prominently in the development of the $30 million, 275,000 square-foot Cardinal Health medical warehouse.

Michigan’s first urban state park, popular cultural attractions, and new residences and businesses continue to expand in this formerly industrial section of the city. The Detroit River Conservancy estimates $275 million have already been invested along the riverfront with an additional $1 billion expected to be invested in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Michigan Department of Natural Resources Outdoor Adventure Center&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Located on Detroit’s riverfront in the historic Globe Building, the Outdoor Adventure Center, or OAC, gives Detroit residents a taste of Michigan’s great outdoors in the heart of the city. In 2016, its first full year of operation,  the OAC saw 100,000 visitors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A $15 million renovation revitalized this former dry dock. The Globe Building had an important role in Great Lakes maritime history as a manufacturer of marine steam engines for freight and passenger vessels. Henry Ford worked at Detroit Dry Dock Engine Works from 1880-1882 as an apprentice machinist, learning the skills associated with his first love, steam-powered engines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The city of Detroit made the first investment in the OAC project using $200,000 from the Brownfields Assessment and Cleanup Grant Program to remove contaminated soils on the site.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;20 Jobs Created\n$15 Million Redevelopment Investment&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Orleans Landing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Construction is near completion on the $65 million, 270-apartment Orleans Landing complex. Located immediately next to the Outdoor Adventure Center, the 270 unit Orleans Landing Apartments gives Detroiters the opportunity to enjoy the redeveloped neighborhood.  When completed in 2017, the development represented the first market-rate residential construction project on Detroit’s East Riverfront in 25 years. An EPA Brownfields Assessment and Cleanup Grant to the Detroit Wayne County Port Authority, or DWCPA, funded the environmental investigation needed to demonstrate the feasibility of residential construction on the site.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;33 Jobs Created\n$61 Million Redevelopment Reinvestment&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Detroit Elevator Building&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once an old warehouse, the Elevator Building has been redeveloped into loft-style office space for small businesses. An EPA Brownfields Assessment and Cleanup Grant to the DWCPA was used to identify hazardous materials that were subsequently managed during building renovations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2 Jobs Created&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Detroit Riverwalk&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The riverfront was mainly an industrial and warehouse district for most of the 19th and 20th centuries. Now, more than 3 million people a year use the Detroit RiverWalk, the pedestrian/bike path that runs along the river from Belle Isle to Rosa Parks Boulevard. It’s one of downtown’s most popular attractions. The DWCPA conducted the necessary environmental investigations using its EPA Brownfields Assessment and Cleanup Grant Program funding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Piquette Square&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Formerly the site of an abandon Studebaker plant, the Piquette Square development in Detroit provides 150 apartments to house and care for homeless veterans. In addition to shelter, the project offers space for a wide range of support services to help veterans develop self-sufficiency to reintegrate into the community. Southwest Housing Solutions developed and manages the facility which opened for occupancy in June 2010.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The project’s success required financial assistance from numerous government agencies and charitable organizations.

REUTERS\\/Nayan Sthankiya\\/File Photo ](https://preview.redd.it/iolkx4o7t94c1.png?width=768&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c39eab2128801c4dbf2885d79c9bd557ad161c38)\n\n ALEXANDRIA, Louisiana (Reuters) - Start-up tech firms are racing to transform the way rare earths are refined for the clean energy transition, a push aimed at turbocharging the West's expansion into the niche sector that underpins billions of electronic devices. \n\nThe existing standard to refine these strategic minerals, known as solvent extraction, is an expensive and dirty process that China has spent the past 30 years mastering. MP Materials, Lynas Rare Earths and other Western rare earths companies have struggled at times to deploy it due to technical complexities and pollution concerns.\n\nRare earths are a group of 17 metals used to make magnets that turn power into motion for electric vehicles, cell phones and other electronics. While U.S. scientists helped develop solvent extraction for rare earths in the 1950s, radioactive waste from the process gradually made it unpopular in the United States.\n\nChina began to rapidly expand in the industry starting during the 1980s and now controls 87% of global rare earths refining capacity, according to the International Energy Agency. That prowess has helped propel the country's economy to the second-largest in the world.\n\nEmerging Western rivals now offer the tantalizing prospect of processing the minerals in faster, cleaner and cheaper ways, if they can successfully launch. \n\n\"The existing rare earths refining process is a nightmare,\" said Isabel Barton, a mining and geological engineering professor at the University of Arizona. \"That's why there are so many companies promising new methods, because we need new ones.\"\n\nInterviews with nearly two dozen industry consultants, academics and executives show that if one or more of these novel processing technologies succeed as hoped by 2025, they could slash reliance on Chinese rare earths technology and its toxic by-products while also bolstering plans by Western firms to charge premium prices for the strategic minerals.\n\nWhile none have launched commercially - and some industry consultants and analysts question whether they will be able to do so soon - a cadre of firms are pushing forward with aggressive development plans.\n\nOn a former U.S. Air Force base in Louisiana, Ucore Rare Metals aims to process rare earths by mid-2025 using a technology known as RapidSX that it says is at least three times faster than solvent extraction, produces no hazardous chemical waste and requires only a third of the physical space.\n\n\"Our goal is to re-establish a North American rare earths supply chain,\" Michael Schrider, Ucore's chief operating officer, said during a visit to the site.\n\nFormed in 2006, Ucore initially planned to mine a rare earths deposit in Alaska. But the company changed tack in 2022 to focus on refining, not mining, a pivot born from what two executives said they saw as a flaw in the West's strategy to weaken China's minerals dominance by trying to master both steps simultaneously.\n\n[ A view of the MP Materials rare earth open-pit mine in Mountain Pass, California, U.S. January 30, 2020.

The lab last month agreed to research new refining techniques for privately-held U.S. Critical Materials, which is developing a Wyoming rare earths deposit.\n\nSKEPTICISM\n\nDespite the hunger for new refining techniques, industry consultants warned that manufacturers may be expecting too much and too soon from this so-far unproven group of nascent technologies, especially given the world's aggressive electrification targets.\n\nUcore's technology, for example, has never worked at commercial scale and is not expected to gain patent protection until next year, a timeline that industry consultants flagged as a cause for concern given strong rivalries for intellectual property.\n\n[ FILE PHOTO: A wheel loader operator fills a truck with ore at the MP Materials rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, California, U.S. January 30, 2020.

That has sparked concerns that rare earths could be next.\n\nFannon and several U.S. politicians have called for Western governments to create central rare earths processing hubs, a plan already being pursued by Canada.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, government scientists are working to launch their own rare earths processing technology after attempts to buy Chinese technology sputtered in 2020.\n\n\"We looked at existing technologies and said, 'There's a better way of doing this,'\" said Mike Crabtree, CEO of the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC), which is funded by the provincial government. \"We wanted to put our own spin on it.\"\n\nUsing artificial intelligence, the company designed processing equipment it believes is more efficient than Chinese rivals. Rather than needing up to 100 people to run, as with traditional solvent extraction, the SRC estimates that only four people will be needed to run its plant, which it hopes to open by the end of 2024.\n\nWhile the SRC's goal is to spur mining across Canada, Crabtree said he is open to licensing the technology for use anywhere in the world.\n\n\"This entire sector as a whole needs to grow outside of China in order to support the energy transition,\" he said.\n\nCrabtree and the SRC expect their facility to cost more to build than Chinese rivals but less to operate, a function of their desire to make processing equipment that has no waste and recycles acid and other key chemicals.\n\nAnd while MP Materials and others have struggled to tailor their processing equipment to specific geological deposits, SRC, Ucore and others say they believe their new refining processes will be able to process the critical minerals from multiple locations across the globe.\n\n\"These new sources for rare earths are going to be paramount if we're going to reach global net zero targets,\" said Steve Schoffstall of the Sprott Energy Transition Materials ETF, which holds shares in several rare earths companies.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n# Dec. 4th, 2203, ~Why we need international data sharing on critical minerals:\n\n [Why we need international data sharing on critical minerals | World Economic Forum (weforum.org)](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/12/why-we-need-international-data-sharing-on-critical-minerals/) \n\n[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9ufs6eypr94c1.png?width=1600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bb24607cf5a5d73ca4d473c151940150b5bba744)\n\n* **Critical minerals are key inputs for green energy technologies and energy security.**\n* **Insufficient data on minerals is causing uncertainty for producers and consumers.**\n* **Policy-makers can facilitate the energy transition and energy security by supporting international data sharing.**\n\nCritical minerals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel are key inputs for clean energy technologies. They could become highly important for the global economy like crude oil is today and, thus, play a major role in energy security. However, insufficient data on minerals consumption, production, trade and inventories is causing uncertainty for consumers and producers, leading to price volatility and possibly delaying much needed investment to meet a growing demand. Countries and private companies can facilitate the energy transition and mitigate energy security concerns by supporting international data sharing.\n\n# Critical minerals are key inputs into green technologies\n\nThe energy transition implies a significant increase in minerals demand as renewables and electric cars are more minerals-intensive than their conventional counterparts. For example, under the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) net-zero emissions scenario, lithium and cobalt consumption increases more than 20 and 5-fold, respectively, over the next two decades. Energy security will become less dependent on fossil fuels but more so on critical minerals.\n\n# Markets for critical minerals are vulnerable\n\nCritical minerals markets are highly concentrated — more so than oil markets — making them [vulnerable to geoeconomic fragmentation](https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WEO/2023/October/English/ch3.ashx). For example, about 70% of the global cobalt production is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see Figure 1). In comparison, the [global production share](https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/10/03/geoeconomic-fragmentation-threatens-food-security-and-clean-energy-transition) of the top three crude oil producers is only about 40%. Moreover, supply is very inelastic, as opening new mines can be a decade-long process. Overall, these factors make the production of critical minerals vulnerable to disruptions from natural catastrophes, wars, and fragmentation in investments and trade. Another reason why timely data at a global scale is important for firms and traders.\n\n# A data-sharing initiative\n\nPolicy-makers can facilitate the energy transition and energy security by putting increased focus on critical minerals and taking actions to help expand their supply. A data sharing initiative would strengthen international cooperation on critical minerals. Essential actions include the following:\n\nFirst, launching an international institution or initiative to collect and share data on critical minerals markets. This could be analogous to the interagency and intergovernmental data-platforms for fossil fuels and agricultural goods, namely the [Joint Organizations Data Initiative on Oil and Gas](https://www.jodidata.org/) (JODI) and the [Agricultural Market Information System](https://www.amis-outlook.org/) (AMIS). There are numerous national and regional databases for minerals (for example, the ASEAN Mineral Database and Information System, or AMDIS), but no common approach to data collection, no harmonization of data formats, and limited data sharing among them. Like the IEA and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), there is a need for an institution that could present and update the status of and outlook for critical minerals markets on a regular basis.\n\nSecond, ensuring broad participation in data sharing. As both advanced economies as well as emerging and developing economies are key producers and consumers of critical minerals, broad participation is key.\n\nThird, sharing data on several frequencies and purposes. Shared data should ideally include annual and quarterly frequencies and cover data on the supply of and demand for critical minerals, including geological data, production and demand data, and data on global trade, as well as inventories of key minerals for the energy transition, by country (and with an ample country coverage). In addition, national geological surveys and international organizations could provide guidance, building on statistical standards and reporting templates that exist for some of the metals. Further, as consumers of critical minerals become increasingly concerned with the provenance and sustainability of these materials, it will be important to standardize and collect data on, for example, national policies and legal frameworks, and sustainability criteria (including environmental assessments and information on impacted communities).\n\nAs this initiative is developed, it will be important to keep in mind the central role emerging economies will play in the critical minerals supply chain. Increased access to market data and forecasts would help these countries as they prepare national development strategies and seek to move up the value chain. These countries also, however, often have significant capacity constraints when it comes to collecting data. It is therefore crucial that the initiative includes or is complemented by a capacity building effort to help target countries improve their ability to collect and disseminate critical minerals data.\n\n \n\n# COP28 Trade Day event: Critical minerals, the energy transition and the role of trade\n\n [COP28 Trade Day event: Critical minerals, the energy transition and the role of trade | UNCTAD](https://unctad.org/meeting/cop28-trade-day-event-critical-minerals-energy-transition-and-role-trade) \n\n[ The upcoming COP28 United Nations climate summit, which will take place from 30 November to 12 December in Dubai, will spotlight the role of trade in goods and services and trade policy can play in bolstering and accelerating the clean energy transition.](https://preview.redd.it/94iosebes94c1.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8d48febd0b9b77b08a544a02e348c37e682fad72)\n\nThe conference, hosted by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), will dedicate an entire day to discussions on trade, the first of its kind within the context of a UN climate conference.

The system, known as the A-Lab, devises recipes for materials, including some that might find uses in batteries or solar cells. Then, it carries out the synthesis and analyses the products — all without human intervention. Meanwhile, another AI system has predicted the existence of hundreds of thousands of stable materials, giving the A-Lab plenty of candidates to strive for in future. \n\nTogether, these advances promise to dramatically accelerate the discovery of materials for clean-energy technologies, next-generation electronics and a host of other applications. “A lot of the technologies around us, including batteries and solar cells, could really improve with better materials,” says Ekin Dogus Cubuk, who leads the materials discovery team at Google DeepMind in London and was involved in both studies, which were published today in *Nature*[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03745-5#ref-CR1),[2](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03745-5#ref-CR2).\n\n“Scientific discovery is the next frontier for AI,” says Carla Gomes, co-director of the Cornell University AI for Science Institute in Ithaca, New York, who was not involved in the research. “That’s why I find this so exciting.”\n\n## Supersizing materials discovery\n\nOver centuries of painstaking laboratory work, chemists have synthesized several hundred thousand inorganic compounds — generally speaking, materials not based on the chains of carbon atoms that are characteristic of organic chemistry. Yet studies suggest that billions of relatively simple inorganic materials are still waiting to be discovered[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03745-5#ref-CR3). So where to start looking?\n\nMany projects have tried to cut down on time spent in the lab tinkering with various materials by computationally simulating new inorganic materials and calculating properties such as how their atoms would pack together in a crystal. These efforts — including the Materials Project based at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, California — have collectively come up with about 48,000 materials that they predict will be stable.\n\n#  The crystal structure of Ba6Nb7O21, one of the materials predicted by GNoME.

After training on data scraped from the Materials Project and similar databases, GNoME tweaked the composition of known materials to come up with 2.2 million potential compounds. After calculating whether these materials would be stable, and predicting their crystal structures, the system produced a final tally of 381,000 new inorganic compounds to add to the Materials Project database[1](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03745-5#ref-CR1).\n\nCrucially, GNoME uses several tactics to predict more materials than previous AI systems. For example, rather than changing all of the calcium ions in a material to magnesium, it might substitute only half of them, or try a wider range of unusual atom swaps. It’s no problem if these tweaks don’t work out, because the system weeds out anything that isn’t stable, and learns from its mistakes. “This is like ChatGPT for materials discovery,” Gomes says\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/df5wbdu6r94c1.png?width=950&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d11a1a3fddc3abc59ebfb9527e3c226e5e7359a\n\n# The indefatigable robot\n\nIt’s one thing to predict the existence of a material, but quite another to actually make it in the lab. That’s where the A-Lab comes in. “We now have the capability to rapidly make these new materials we come up with computationally,” says Gerbrand Ceder, a materials scientist at LBNL and the University of California, Berkeley, who led the A-Lab team.\n\nThe A-Lab, housed at LBNL, uses state-of-the-art robotics to mix and heat powdered solid ingredients, and then analyses the product to check whether the procedure worked. The US$2-million set-up took 18 months to build. But the biggest challenge lay in using AI to make the system truly autonomous, so that it could plan experiments, interpret data and make decisions about how to improve a synthesis. “The robots are great fun to watch, but the innovation is really under the hood,” Ceder says.....\n\n........ **Meanwhile, the A-Lab is still running reactions and will add the results to the Materials Project, so scientists around the world can use them to inform their own work. This growing cache could be the system’s greatest legacy, Ceder says: “It’s essentially a map of the reactivity of common solids. And that’s what will change the world — not A-Lab itself, but the knowledge and information that it generates.”** \n\n#  FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS &amp; CONCLUSIONS:\n\n# [NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project Confirmed as the Second Largest Indicated-Or-Better Rare Earth Resource in the U.S. - NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorps-elk-creek-project-confirmed-as-the-second-largest-indicated-or-better-rare-earth-resource-in-the-u-s/)\n\n***Owner: NIOCORP/Elk Creek Resources (NIOBF) Deposit Type: Carbonatite with Bastnäsite***\n\n*\\*\\*\\*NOTE NIOCORP is completing &amp; calculating results from completed Demonstration Plant Operations, &amp; a June 2023 HYDROLOGICAL DRILLING Campaign (For Shaft Sinking).

REUTERS/Nayan Sthankiya/File Photo &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ALEXANDRIA, Louisiana (Reuters) - Start-up tech firms are racing to transform the way rare earths are refined for the clean energy transition, a push aimed at turbocharging the West&amp;#39;s expansion into the niche sector that underpins billions of electronic devices. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The existing standard to refine these strategic minerals, known as solvent extraction, is an expensive and dirty process that China has spent the past 30 years mastering. MP Materials, Lynas Rare Earths and other Western rare earths companies have struggled at times to deploy it due to technical complexities and pollution concerns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rare earths are a group of 17 metals used to make magnets that turn power into motion for electric vehicles, cell phones and other electronics. While U.S. scientists helped develop solvent extraction for rare earths in the 1950s, radioactive waste from the process gradually made it unpopular in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;China began to rapidly expand in the industry starting during the 1980s and now controls 87% of global rare earths refining capacity, according to the International Energy Agency. That prowess has helped propel the country&amp;#39;s economy to the second-largest in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emerging Western rivals now offer the tantalizing prospect of processing the minerals in faster, cleaner and cheaper ways, if they can successfully launch. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The existing rare earths refining process is a nightmare,&amp;quot; said Isabel Barton, a mining and geological engineering professor at the University of Arizona. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s why there are so many companies promising new methods, because we need new ones.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Interviews with nearly two dozen industry consultants, academics and executives show that if one or more of these novel processing technologies succeed as hoped by 2025, they could slash reliance on Chinese rare earths technology and its toxic by-products while also bolstering plans by Western firms to charge premium prices for the strategic minerals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While none have launched commercially - and some industry consultants and analysts question whether they will be able to do so soon - a cadre of firms are pushing forward with aggressive development plans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a former U.S. Air Force base in Louisiana, Ucore Rare Metals aims to process rare earths by mid-2025 using a technology known as RapidSX that it says is at least three times faster than solvent extraction, produces no hazardous chemical waste and requires only a third of the physical space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Our goal is to re-establish a North American rare earths supply chain,&amp;quot; Michael Schrider, Ucore&amp;#39;s chief operating officer, said during a visit to the site.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Formed in 2006, Ucore initially planned to mine a rare earths deposit in Alaska. But the company changed tack in 2022 to focus on refining, not mining, a pivot born from what two executives said they saw as a flaw in the West&amp;#39;s strategy to weaken China&amp;#39;s minerals dominance by trying to master both steps simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/h7a83yfgt94c1.png?width=768&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=00cfce39748ac8cab6c67d235bd6e1f275c4442f\"&gt; A view of the MP Materials rare earth open-pit mine in Mountain Pass, California, U.S. January 30, 2020.

The lab last month agreed to research new refining techniques for privately-held U.S. Critical Materials, which is developing a Wyoming rare earths deposit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SKEPTICISM&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Despite the hunger for new refining techniques, industry consultants warned that manufacturers may be expecting too much and too soon from this so-far unproven group of nascent technologies, especially given the world&amp;#39;s aggressive electrification targets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ucore&amp;#39;s technology, for example, has never worked at commercial scale and is not expected to gain patent protection until next year, a timeline that industry consultants flagged as a cause for concern given strong rivalries for intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7feukhtrt94c1.png?width=768&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=9134dee85b5daddd672ae8d9052e22fcf20d37b5\"&gt; FILE PHOTO: A wheel loader operator fills a truck with ore at the MP Materials rare earth mine in Mountain Pass, California, U.S. January 30, 2020.

Talks of production within a few years &amp;quot;creates a false sense of security for policymakers.&amp;quot;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mvk875kwt94c1.png?width=768&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=0af4f6e3437d5021a73cdc524c40d09688e200de\"&gt; UCore Chief Operating Officer Michael Schrider and Vice President of Business Development Geoff Atkins pose with blueprints for new rare earth processing equipment that they plan to install at a former U.S. Air Force base in Alexandria, Louisiana, U.S. October 17, 2023. REUTERS/Ernest Scheyder© Thomson Reuters &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet the need for alternatives is rising, especially in the wake of Beijing&amp;#39;s decision earlier this year to curb exports of germanium, graphite and other metals. That has sparked concerns that rare earths could be next.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fannon and several U.S. politicians have called for Western governments to create central rare earths processing hubs, a plan already being pursued by Canada.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Saskatchewan, government scientists are working to launch their own rare earths processing technology after attempts to buy Chinese technology sputtered in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We looked at existing technologies and said, &amp;#39;There&amp;#39;s a better way of doing this,&amp;#39;&amp;quot; said Mike Crabtree, CEO of the Saskatchewan Research Council (SRC), which is funded by the provincial government. &amp;quot;We wanted to put our own spin on it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using artificial intelligence, the company designed processing equipment it believes is more efficient than Chinese rivals. Rather than needing up to 100 people to run, as with traditional solvent extraction, the SRC estimates that only four people will be needed to run its plant, which it hopes to open by the end of 2024.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the SRC&amp;#39;s goal is to spur mining across Canada, Crabtree said he is open to licensing the technology for use anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This entire sector as a whole needs to grow outside of China in order to support the energy transition,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crabtree and the SRC expect their facility to cost more to build than Chinese rivals but less to operate, a function of their desire to make processing equipment that has no waste and recycles acid and other key chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And while MP Materials and others have struggled to tailor their processing equipment to specific geological deposits, SRC, Ucore and others say they believe their new refining processes will be able to process the critical minerals from multiple locations across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;These new sources for rare earths are going to be paramount if we&amp;#39;re going to reach global net zero targets,&amp;quot; said Steve Schoffstall of the Sprott Energy Transition Materials ETF, which holds shares in several rare earths companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Dec. 4th, 2203, ~Why we need international data sharing on critical minerals:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2023/12/why-we-need-international-data-sharing-on-critical-minerals/\"&gt;Why we need international data sharing on critical minerals | World Economic Forum (weforum.org)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/9ufs6eypr94c1.png?width=1600&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=bb24607cf5a5d73ca4d473c151940150b5bba744\"&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical minerals are key inputs for green energy technologies and energy security.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insufficient data on minerals is causing uncertainty for producers and consumers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy-makers can facilitate the energy transition and energy security by supporting international data sharing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt and nickel are key inputs for clean energy technologies. They could become highly important for the global economy like crude oil is today and, thus, play a major role in energy security. However, insufficient data on minerals consumption, production, trade and inventories is causing uncertainty for consumers and producers, leading to price volatility and possibly delaying much needed investment to meet a growing demand. Countries and private companies can facilitate the energy transition and mitigate energy security concerns by supporting international data sharing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Critical minerals are key inputs into green technologies&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The energy transition implies a significant increase in minerals demand as renewables and electric cars are more minerals-intensive than their conventional counterparts. For example, under the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) net-zero emissions scenario, lithium and cobalt consumption increases more than 20 and 5-fold, respectively, over the next two decades. Energy security will become less dependent on fossil fuels but more so on critical minerals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Markets for critical minerals are vulnerable&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Critical minerals markets are highly concentrated — more so than oil markets — making them &lt;a href=\"https://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WEO/2023/October/English/ch3.ashx\"&gt;vulnerable to geoeconomic fragmentation&lt;/a&gt;. For example, about 70% of the global cobalt production is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see Figure 1). In comparison, the &lt;a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2023/10/03/geoeconomic-fragmentation-threatens-food-security-and-clean-energy-transition\"&gt;global production share&lt;/a&gt; of the top three crude oil producers is only about 40%. Moreover, supply is very inelastic, as opening new mines can be a decade-long process. Overall, these factors make the production of critical minerals vulnerable to disruptions from natural catastrophes, wars, and fragmentation in investments and trade. Another reason why timely data at a global scale is important for firms and traders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;A data-sharing initiative&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Policy-makers can facilitate the energy transition and energy security by putting increased focus on critical minerals and taking actions to help expand their supply. A data sharing initiative would strengthen international cooperation on critical minerals. Essential actions include the following:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, launching an international institution or initiative to collect and share data on critical minerals markets. This could be analogous to the interagency and intergovernmental data-platforms for fossil fuels and agricultural goods, namely the &lt;a href=\"https://www.jodidata.org/\"&gt;Joint Organizations Data Initiative on Oil and Gas&lt;/a&gt; (JODI) and the &lt;a href=\"https://www.amis-outlook.org/\"&gt;Agricultural Market Information System&lt;/a&gt; (AMIS). There are numerous national and regional databases for minerals (for example, the ASEAN Mineral Database and Information System, or AMDIS), but no common approach to data collection, no harmonization of data formats, and limited data sharing among them. Like the IEA and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), there is a need for an institution that could present and update the status of and outlook for critical minerals markets on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Second, ensuring broad participation in data sharing. As both advanced economies as well as emerging and developing economies are key producers and consumers of critical minerals, broad participation is key.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Third, sharing data on several frequencies and purposes. Shared data should ideally include annual and quarterly frequencies and cover data on the supply of and demand for critical minerals, including geological data, production and demand data, and data on global trade, as well as inventories of key minerals for the energy transition, by country (and with an ample country coverage). In addition, national geological surveys and international organizations could provide guidance, building on statistical standards and reporting templates that exist for some of the metals. Further, as consumers of critical minerals become increasingly concerned with the provenance and sustainability of these materials, it will be important to standardize and collect data on, for example, national policies and legal frameworks, and sustainability criteria (including environmental assessments and information on impacted communities).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As this initiative is developed, it will be important to keep in mind the central role emerging economies will play in the critical minerals supply chain. Increased access to market data and forecasts would help these countries as they prepare national development strategies and seek to move up the value chain. These countries also, however, often have significant capacity constraints when it comes to collecting data. It is therefore crucial that the initiative includes or is complemented by a capacity building effort to help target countries improve their ability to collect and disseminate critical minerals data.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;COP28 Trade Day event: Critical minerals, the energy transition and the role of trade&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://unctad.org/meeting/cop28-trade-day-event-critical-minerals-energy-transition-and-role-trade\"&gt;COP28 Trade Day event: Critical minerals, the energy transition and the role of trade | UNCTAD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/94iosebes94c1.png?width=1200&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8d48febd0b9b77b08a544a02e348c37e682fad72\"&gt; The upcoming COP28 United Nations climate summit, which will take place from 30 November to 12 December in Dubai, will spotlight the role of trade in goods and services and trade policy can play in bolstering and accelerating the clean energy transition.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The conference, hosted by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), will dedicate an entire day to discussions on trade, the first of its kind within the context of a UN climate conference.

The system, known as the A-Lab, devises recipes for materials, including some that might find uses in batteries or solar cells. Then, it carries out the synthesis and analyses the products — all without human intervention. Meanwhile, another AI system has predicted the existence of hundreds of thousands of stable materials, giving the A-Lab plenty of candidates to strive for in future. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Together, these advances promise to dramatically accelerate the discovery of materials for clean-energy technologies, next-generation electronics and a host of other applications. “A lot of the technologies around us, including batteries and solar cells, could really improve with better materials,” says Ekin Dogus Cubuk, who leads the materials discovery team at Google DeepMind in London and was involved in both studies, which were published today in &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03745-5#ref-CR1\"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03745-5#ref-CR2\"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Scientific discovery is the next frontier for AI,” says Carla Gomes, co-director of the Cornell University AI for Science Institute in Ithaca, New York, who was not involved in the research. “That’s why I find this so exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Supersizing materials discovery&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Over centuries of painstaking laboratory work, chemists have synthesized several hundred thousand inorganic compounds — generally speaking, materials not based on the chains of carbon atoms that are characteristic of organic chemistry. Yet studies suggest that billions of relatively simple inorganic materials are still waiting to be discovered&lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03745-5#ref-CR3\"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;. So where to start looking?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Many projects have tried to cut down on time spent in the lab tinkering with various materials by computationally simulating new inorganic materials and calculating properties such as how their atoms would pack together in a crystal. These efforts — including the Materials Project based at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, California — have collectively come up with about 48,000 materials that they predict will be stable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The crystal structure of Ba6Nb7O21, one of the materials predicted by GNoME.

After training on data scraped from the Materials Project and similar databases, GNoME tweaked the composition of known materials to come up with 2.2 million potential compounds. After calculating whether these materials would be stable, and predicting their crystal structures, the system produced a final tally of 381,000 new inorganic compounds to add to the Materials Project database&lt;a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03745-5#ref-CR1\"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crucially, GNoME uses several tactics to predict more materials than previous AI systems. For example, rather than changing all of the calcium ions in a material to magnesium, it might substitute only half of them, or try a wider range of unusual atom swaps. It’s no problem if these tweaks don’t work out, because the system weeds out anything that isn’t stable, and learns from its mistakes. “This is like ChatGPT for materials discovery,” Gomes says&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/df5wbdu6r94c1.png?width=950&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7d11a1a3fddc3abc59ebfb9527e3c226e5e7359a\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/df5wbdu6r94c1.png?width=950&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=7d11a1a3fddc3abc59ebfb9527e3c226e5e7359a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The indefatigable robot&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s one thing to predict the existence of a material, but quite another to actually make it in the lab. That’s where the A-Lab comes in. “We now have the capability to rapidly make these new materials we come up with computationally,” says Gerbrand Ceder, a materials scientist at LBNL and the University of California, Berkeley, who led the A-Lab team.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The A-Lab, housed at LBNL, uses state-of-the-art robotics to mix and heat powdered solid ingredients, and then analyses the product to check whether the procedure worked. The US$2-million set-up took 18 months to build. But the biggest challenge lay in using AI to make the system truly autonomous, so that it could plan experiments, interpret data and make decisions about how to improve a synthesis. “The robots are great fun to watch, but the innovation is really under the hood,” Ceder says.....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;........ &lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile, the A-Lab is still running reactions and will add the results to the Materials Project, so scientists around the world can use them to inform their own work. This growing cache could be the system’s greatest legacy, Ceder says: “It’s essentially a map of the reactivity of common solids. And that’s what will change the world — not A-Lab itself, but the knowledge and information that it generates.”&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS &amp;amp; CONCLUSIONS:&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.niocorp.com/niocorps-elk-creek-project-confirmed-as-the-second-largest-indicated-or-better-rare-earth-resource-in-the-u-s/\"&gt;NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project Confirmed as the Second Largest Indicated-Or-Better Rare Earth Resource in the U.S. - NioCorp Developments Ltd.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Owner: NIOCORP/Elk Creek Resources (NIOBF) Deposit Type: Carbonatite with Bastnäsite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;\\&lt;/em&gt;**NOTE NIOCORP is completing &amp;amp; calculating results from completed Demonstration Plant Operations, &amp;amp; a June 2023 HYDROLOGICAL DRILLING Campaign (For Shaft Sinking).

          "selftext": "It certainly has been a brutal three months since Q2 earnings were reported.  EXAS closed at $96.44 on August 1st, before the 2nd quarter earnings announcement, and while the rest of the market was flying high earlier this week, EXAS traded all the way down to a low of $58.53, a drop of almost 40% from peak to trough, on Monday, October 30th.\n\nThere has been much speculation as to the cause of the precipitous decline--over $7 billion in market cap--after Q2 earnings.  Was the earnings report that bad?  I certainly don't think so.  While management reported a beat, beat and raise, the earnings whisper number was not met.  But did this warrant the ensuing bloodbath?    \n\nAs I have stated in a previous post, the business today is seemingly on a better footing today than it ever has been. Cologuard revenue growth has been strong lately. Management's move earlier this year to refinance $300+ million in convertible debt coming due in 2027 and 2028 at the low rate of 2%, pushing maturities out to 2030, seems prescient. Cologuard 2.0 sensitivity, specificity and AA detection is improved over existing Cologuard, cementing Exact Sciences leading position in stool-dna based CRC screening in the US for the reasonably foreseeable future. The Company is anticipating material revenues from the sale of the OncotypeDX breast test in Japan beginning next year, and is swiftly pursuing opportunities in the area of MRD testing, a market the Company believes to be the biggest opportunity in all of diagnostics, and which the Company is particularly well-suited to exploit. Longer-term, the company also continues to refine its promising MCED test which could revolutionize cancer screening as we know it.\n\nIn Q2, the company reported free cash flow of $66 million in Q2, an improvement of $190 million YOY, and adjusted EBITDA of $67 million, an improvement of $113 million YOY, testament to the \"operating expense discipline\" management has been referring to.  Management has seemingly been sharpening its pencils to accelerate the path to profitability, while at the same time continuing to invest heavily in its commercial engine and R&amp;D programs.     \n\nSome have criticized management's recent decision to acquire Resolution Biosciences as proof that the Company isn't serious about becoming profitable. The stock price closed at $79.77 the day before the acquisition was announced, on September 12th, and has tumbled over $20 since then.  But management reported that the terms of the acquisition were not material to either party.  While I don't anticipate much in the way of impact in the 3rd quarter, there will no doubt be a lot of expense associated with this acquisition which could impact Q4 and full year 2024 profitability.\n\nThere has been a lot of criticism of the Company's MRD and MCED programs, and the billions of dollars which EXAS has spent trying to develop these tests over the years.  The Company recently announced that it was planning to build a 250,000-square-foot facility with lab, office, manufacturing and warehouse space in Phoenix.  EXAS reportedly has about 190 employees in Phoenix and estimates adding 800.  Management has indicated that MRD testing is perhaps the single biggest opportunity currently in all of diagnostics.  I am assuming that this facility is intended to be the hub for the Company's MRD business.  \n\nEXAS has spent billions in Cologuard revenues on its precision oncology business, including the acquisitions of Genomic Health, THRIVE Earlier Detection, Biomatrica, Ashion Analytics, Paradigm Diagnostics, Viomics and Prevention Genetics.  In addition, the Company has licensed technology from TGen, the Broad Institute at MIT and Harvard in pursuit of an effective MRD test technology.  Some wonder whether the company has a clear strategy for the development of its MRD and MCED tests, or whether  it is simply throwing darts?  The Resolution Biosciences acquisition seems like yet another attempt to shore up the company's precision oncology business capabilities.  Whether the billions of dollars spent will yield tangible results remains to be seen.  What is clear is that money to invest in R&amp;D in the biotech sector for new cancer diagnostics appears to be drying up quickly.  This should give well-funded companies such as Exact Sciences a leg up when it comes to developing the next generation of precision oncology tests.\n\nManagement has guided to 3rd Quarter revenues of $605-$620 Million, with screening revenues of $455-$465 million and precision oncology revenues of $150-$155 million.  Wall Street consensus is a loss of $-0.48 and Revenue of $617 Million.  Lately, management has underpromised and overdelivered, so I would be surprised if that isn't the case with this quarterly report, also.  \n\nHow will the stock react?  That is anybody's guess, but stocks tend to react in the direction of the trend,  which is decidedly lower.  Please feel free to comment below with your take on this quarter's earnings expectations.

The Monetary Board isn’t scheduled to meet until November 16th, but Mr. Remolona said if “the data says inflation will go up very significantly” the Monetary Board “may go for an off-cycle hike as early as Thursday”, but that a potential hike could “also happen next week.”\r\n&gt;    - ***MB:*** *The Philippine Statistics Authority isn’t scheduled to release the CPI data for October until November 7, so I’m not exactly sure what data the BSP would be looking at that could trigger such an aggressive response. If the big concern is the USD/PHP exchange rate, then I’m even more confused because the rate has remained more or less stable in the ₱56.5 to ₱56.9 range since the beginning of August. Mr. Remolona said that he would defend the ₱57/$1 psychological line, but a breach of that level doesn’t appear to be imminent so I’m not sure where the sudden rush to raise rates is coming from. Either way, the BSP appears to be grooming the market to expect a raise, basically at any time over the next three weeks. A rate hike would help support the Philippine Peso’s valuation relative to the dollar, and protect firms that have significant US dollar-denominated debts, but it would also push REIT yields higher and suppress REIT stock prices as a result.*\r\n\r\n&gt;- **[NOTES] Quick takes from around the market...**\r\n&gt;    - **NOW Corp** [NOW 1.37 ▼2.8%; 144% avgVol] announced the start of commercial operations for TODAYbyNOW, its new IT consulting service. TODAYbyNOW is aimed at the “small and midsize enterprise” segment to provide on-call consulting, bulk desktop setups, cyberthreat assessments, cloud migration, and WIFI security audits. The service will be available nation-wide. \r\n&gt;       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *The “total addressable market” for something like this is astoundingly huge. Think of all the family-owned businesses out there that are still tracking sales using a locally-stored Excel spreadsheet, on an ancient PC, running a “Greenhills” hacked version of Windows 7, that only Michelle in Accounting has the password to access. There are probably a hundred lifetimes of work just in migrating companies toward some form of network-controlled central storage to protect company data. But the problem here is the one that has faced underpaid and anxious IT managers here for decades: how to convince owners and managers that IT is an investment and not just a “cost center”? Michelle’s workflow isn’t hilariously dangerous because management lacked a cool-sounding service to help do everything for a fee; it’s hilariously dangerous because “doing IT right” looks ridiculously expensive by comparison when none of the externalities of “doing IT wrong” are counted against maintaining the status quo. How much of the total addressable market is a “serviceable obtainable” market for NOW, and what is NOW’s bandwidth for dealing with whatever business it finds?*\r\n&gt;    - **Phoenix Petroleum** [PNX 6.05 ▲0.8%; 0% avgVol] said that it sold its Singapore trading unit for US $19.2 million in an update on the divestment of its interest in PNX Petroleum Singapore (PNX SG). PNX owned 85% of PNX SG, and sold that entire stake to PNX SG in a buy-back for US $0.85/share. This will raise approximately $19.2 million in cash for Phoenix Petroleum Philippines (PNX PH), a subsidiary of PNX, that it can use as a “key enabler” to support its working capital needs. PNX SG is now 100% owned by a company called Libra Investments Pte Ltd., and will be allowed to continue doing business as “PNX Petroleum Singapore Pte Ltd”. \r\n&gt;       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *Even PNX admitted that the sale was done because it was having trouble “raising additional working capital bank lines”. The transaction is still marked by the DNA of a Dennis Uy deal in terms of there being no information of as to the identity of PNX SG’s new owner, nor any guidance as to whether or not this transaction addresses the entirety of PNX PH’s working capital shortfall. Though, if PNX SG was as irrelevant to PNX PH and PNX as this disclosure makes it sound, this was a tidy piece of business.*\r\n&gt;    - **Puregold** [PGOLD 28.40 ▼1.9%; 47% avgVol] teased a revenue growth of 9.2% y/y over the first nine months of 2023, with a 2.2% increase in consolidated net income over the same period. PGOLD said that it “continues to see a buoyant trajectory in topline growth for the balance of the year”, but admitted that the topline growth for the first nine months was “partially offset by compressed margins and higher operating expenses.” \r\n&gt;       - ***MB Quick Take:*** *I’d like to take a look at the actual financial statements, but this seems like a natural consequence of inflation (higher input costs and greater consumer price sensitivity) and the “medicine” to address inflation (increased cost of capital). The rising cost of debt isn’t great news for companies like PGOLD that rely on expensive build-outs to grow, and who rely on consumer spending to recoup those costs. Still, from an operational perspective, it’s impressive to see PGOLD deliver a 4.8% increase in same-store sales for Puregold Stores and a 4.1% increase for S[ 0.53 unch; 0% avgVol]R Warehouse clubs. Without that strong base of operations, shareholders might be more nervous about 2024.*\r\n\r\n**MB** is written and distributed every trading day.

With remote work becoming the norm and consumer behavior shifting, the demand for office and retail spaces has dwindled. As a result, CRE has become one of the weakest links in the U.S. economy, posing significant challenges for businesses and investors alike.\n\nThe CRE market is worth trillions of dollars and accounts for a significant portion of the U.S. GDP. However, with the pandemic causing many businesses to close or operate at reduced capacity, many CRE properties have struggled to maintain occupancy levels. According to data from Moody's Analytics REIS, the national office vacancy rate reached 17.2% in Q3 2021, the highest level in over a decade. Similarly, the retail vacancy rate hit a record high of 11.6% in the same period.\n\nThe struggling CRE market has created ripple effects across the economy. Commercial property owners are struggling to keep up with their mortgage payments, leading to a surge in delinquencies and defaults. This, in turn, puts pressure on banks and other lenders who hold these loans, potentially leading to a credit crisis. Moreover, the decline in CRE demand has caused many construction projects to stall, leading to job losses in the construction industry.\n\nThe shift towards remote work has also impacted the CRE market. With many companies embracing work-from-home policies, demand for office spaces has plummeted. Some businesses have decided to downsize their office space or switch to a remote-only model, leaving many landlords with vacant properties. Additionally, the decline in commuting has hit public transportation systems hard, putting further pressure on the CRE market.\n\nWhile the CRE market has struggled, some sectors have been hit harder than others. For example, the pandemic has caused a significant decline in demand for retail space, with many retailers closing their doors or shifting towards e-commerce. As a result, many shopping centers and malls have struggled to maintain occupancy levels. Similarly, the hospitality industry has been hit hard, with hotels struggling to attract guests amid travel restrictions and safety concerns.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jz3nfb644gqa1.png?width=483&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4e778eab9c13772e47ef73b6fb2726bb9fc9c068\n\nHowever, not all sectors of the CRE market have been negatively impacted. The industrial sector, for example, has seen an uptick in demand due to the rise of e-commerce. With more people shopping online, the need for warehouse and distribution space has increased. Similarly, the demand for data centers has surged, as businesses and individuals rely more heavily on digital services.\n\nAs the pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the economy, the future of the CRE market remains uncertain. While some businesses may eventually return to office-based work, it's unclear if demand for office space will return to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, the rise of remote work and e-commerce may continue to put pressure on the demand for CRE properties. Investors and property owners must be prepared for a potentially prolonged period of uncertainty.\n\nIn conclusion, the CRE market is one of the weakest links in the U.S. economy, with significant challenges for businesses, investors, and lenders. The decline in demand for office and retail space, as well as increased delinquencies and defaults, has created a challenging environment for the industry. However, with some sectors seeing increased demand, such as the industrial and data center sectors, there is still hope for a rebound. As the pandemic continues to evolve, it remains to be seen how the CRE market will respond and adapt to the new normal.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nPlease Like, Subscribe, and Share our Social Media Links:\n\n[https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090143103728](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100090143103728)\n\n[https://www.instagram.com/phoenixcommunityflgt2022/](https://www.instagram.com/phoenixcommunityflgt2022/)\n\n[https://twitter.com/phoenixflgt2022](https://twitter.com/phoenixflgt2022)\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/user/PhoenixCommunityFLGT](https://www.reddit.com/user/PhoenixCommunityFLGT)\n\n[https://discord.gg/y7pfYaSu](https://discord.gg/y7pfYaSu)\n\n[flgt99.com/home](https://flgt99.com/home)",

But Funko continued to grow due  to e-commerce demand that boomed in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nThis was why, according to the company at the time,  Funko decided to consolidate five of its Washington warehouses and move  to a facility that could accommodate its growth while lowering costs and  improving logistics and operations. \n\nFunko started a months-long search for its new  warehouse at the end of 2020, about a year before it informed employees  of the big relocation to a nearly 1 million-square-foot, [class A building located in Buckeye,](https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2021/10/13/toymaker-lease-buckeye.html)  a fast-growing suburb on the outskirts of the Phoenix metro. The  company inked a 10-year lease for the facility in September 2021. \n\nThe company [laid off 258 workers](https://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/news/2022/04/07/funko-layoffs.html) as it transitioned to Arizona and [said it will bring more than 300 jobs to Buckeye](https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2022/04/07/funko-confirms-lease-of-buckeye-facility.html).  Its headquarters and flagship store have remained in Everett, while its  products are primarily manufactured in Vietnam, China and Mexico,  according to the company's [most recent annual report.](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1704711/000170471122000007/fnko-20211231.htm#i72cbc452a8a64495a7ef6cd3e4e4765a_31) \n\n\"Over the last several years, the tremendous growth  of the business has required us to open multiple warehouse locations,  and we have now outgrown this footprint,\" the company told its employees  in early 2022, according to [a report by The Herald in Everett.](https://www.heraldnet.com/business/despite-arizona-move-everett-leaders-expect-funko-hq-to-stay/) \"Consolidating our operations from five buildings to one will create many operational efficiencies.\" \n\nBefore Funko landed in the desert, the leading  toymaker and maker of the collectible pop culture vinyl figures spent  months visiting sites, meeting with officials and narrowing down its  search for a new space that would meet its requirements. Although not a  large manufacturing project with thousands of high-paying jobs, experts  say the company's move to Buckeye helps validate the city as a growing  hub for logistics and supply chain operators as more companies exit  California. \n\nThe city of Buckeye declined to comment for the story. Funko did not respond to multiple requests for comment. \n\n### How Arizona beat out its regional competitors \n\nThrough codename Project Sunlight, Funko's search was  spread out regionally across the Inland Empire in California and Las  Vegas and Reno in Nevada in addition to Arizona, according to the  Greater Phoenix Economic Council, which worked with Funko to find an  Arizona site. \n\nFunko initially set out for a 700,000-square-foot  building that was existing or under development in the western part of  Maricopa County, said Thomas Maynard, senior vice president of business  development at GPEC. He said GPEC helped Funko better understand the  Phoenix metro market, while JLL helped find facilities. \n\n\"Our role is to make sure they’re comfortable with  market at a very high level,\" Maynard said, adding that GPEC officials  participated in site visits with Funko, compared labor costs and set up  interviews with staffing firms for the company. \"We took the lead on  providing a warm welcome, rolling out the red carpet ... and making sure  they had all questions answered.\"\n\nMarkets likes the Inland Empire are significantly  more costly to operate in, while Las Vegas and Reno do not have the same  population growth or number of available buildings as Phoenix, Maynard  said. The initial tour in the Phoenix metro included nine facilities,  which is a lot compared to constricted markets like the Inland Empire,  which has a below 1% vacancy rate. \n\nWhat ultimately led to the win for Arizona was a  number of factors, including the state's lower labor costs, availability  of a workforce, foreign trade zones and readily-available buildings.  Within the Phoenix market, Funko had also narrowed its search between  Goodyear, Glendale and Buckeye, which all have fast-growing industrial  cores.\n\nThe No. 1 reason Funko picked Arizona and ultimately  Buckeye was the site's proximity to the ports of Long Beach and Los  Angeles, where Funko primarily sources its product, said Tony Lydon, a  senior managing director with JLL, which worked with Funko for 18 months  on the relocation. Funko was also attracted to the building because of  its capacity to expand by another 200,000 square feet. \n\n\"The proximity to the port is significant,\" Lydon  told the Business Journal. \"The fact that this location was closer by 24  to 30 minutes to the ports round trip versus a Loop 303 location, they  appreciated that and they saw value in that.\" \n\nLydon said that Funko's Buckeye location is also a  consolidation of its California warehouses, but a decision to close its  California facilities is still to be determined. If they keep the  operations open, Lydon said this would be a business strategy known as  \"California Plus One,\" which means companies keep a longer-term space  commitment in Southern California while also expanding outside of the  state. \n\n### How Five Below set a precedent for Buckeye\n\nBefore Funko signed a lease for Phoenix-based  Creation's new 863,000-square-foot building just south of Interstate 10,  experts said another national retailer set a precedent for Buckeye's  new industrial growth that helped land Funko — Pennsylvania-based Five  Below Inc. \n\n\"They had the assurance of, 'Hey, we won't be the  first user out here,'\" said Maynard with GPEC. \"They \\[also\\] became  comfortable with idea that even if they are in farthest west location  that they’re still able to recruit enough people for their distribution  center.\" \n\nDiscount retailer [Five Below's $75 million facility](https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2020/07/21/discount-retailer-big-distribution-center-buckeye.html)  was one of the biggest industrial projects and employers announced in  recent years in Buckeye that was also developed close to State Route 85  and I-10. This is part of what led Creation to build the speculative  industrial facility next door that eventually became home to Funko, said  Mike Haenel, an executive managing director with Cushman &amp;  Wakefield, which represented Creation as well as Five Below. \n\n\"It's a strategic location in Buckeye with close  proximity to the freeway and was really the closest location to the port  of Long Beach and Southern California without being in California,\"  Haenel said. \"Creation felt like there would be another company like a  Five Below that would have the same goals.\" \n\nThe city of Buckeye also boasted its reverse commute  for workers, a large number of residents that are looking for jobs  within the city of Buckeye, its rapid population growth and other big  employers such as Cardinal Glass and Walmart, according to public  records obtained from the city of Buckeye.\n\nBuckeye's affordable labor, housing and growth,  including new master-planned communities and commercial offerings have  also attracted companies and developers to the city. Since many  industrial employers are located in neighboring cities, this could also  mean less competition for employers in Buckeye for labor.\n\nWith nationally or globally recognized brands like  Five Below and Funko moving in, Haenel said this helps certify Buckeye  as a place for employers to locate while being close to California.  Other improvements to the area, including the I-10 widening in Buckeye  and a proposed reliever to I-10, called State Route 30, are also  positives for companies like Funko. \n\n\"The brokerage community — we knew about Buckeye,\"  Haenel said. \"But we needed a Five Below and Funko, brand names we could  show tenants looking at Arizona, to say 'Hey, this is a viable and  great location and alternative to the Inland Empire.'\" \n\n### Labor, incentives also key considerations\n\nLike many projects considering Arizona, Funko was  also looking for incentives and wanted to locate at a foreign trade zone  designated site, which offers real and personal property tax  reductions, according to public records, which said an FTZ designated  site was a \"deal breaker\" for the company. \n\n\"Anyone that is in the business of international port  activities — and there's many companies in the West Valley and  throughout metropolitan Phoenix that are now part of a global supply  chain — a foreign trade zone certification and application can be very  meaningful to them,\" Lydon said. \"That was very important to \\[Funko\\].\" \n\nLydon said Funko also felt the workforce in Arizona  was \"deeper and more affordable\" compared to Southern California and  Washington. Public records redacted Funko's proposed hourly wages, but  job advertisements from staffing firms such as ProLogistix have listed  hourly wages as $16.50 and $18.33 for warehouse associates and $20 for  forklift operators at the Funko warehouse in Buckeye. During its search,  Funko also wanted to learn about hiring intel from Five Below. \n\nAlthough it's unclear what the current wages for  Funko are, the city of Buckeye said in a letter to the company in 2021  that to receive support for a foreign trade zone designation, which is  federally approved, the company should consider increasing its proposed  wages similar to other employers like Five Below, which the city said  had an average wage of $42,500.\n\n\"The city encourages Project Sunlight to re-evaluate  their average wage rate; for both the FTZ application process but also  in order to ensure competitiveness within the local market,\" the city  said in a letter to Funko. \"Our belief is that should Sunlight modify  its wage rates to a number closer to that of Five Below's, all of the  taxing jurisdictions (including the city) would be supportive of the FTZ  proposal.\" \n\nCities [often vote on support letters](https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2022/03/23/williams-sonoma-arizona-new-details.html)  for companies seeking an FTZ designation. A city of Buckeye  spokesperson said the city has not brought an item to City Council  related to an FTZ site for Funko to date. \n\nWhile Funko was searching for a site, the ACA  proposed $10 million in incentives that the company could qualify for as  of 2021. Funko was also looking for more incentives through the city of  Buckeye, but city economic development officials said in emails that  because they already provided incentives to the developer of the Buckeye  facility, that they couldn't \"double dip\" for Funko with more  incentives.\n\n\"Prior to this building being constructed, the city  of Buckeye didn't have any existing speculative buildings to offer  businesses. Therefore, to entice speculative industrial development in  the community, the city entered into a development agreement,\" a letter  to the company from the city of Buckeye said in 2021. \"The city's  incentives should have hopefully made the building more competitive in  terms of lease structure.\" \n\nThe only other incentives Buckeye's economic  development team said it could propose were FTZ sites, Opportunity Zones  and New Market Tax Credits. Lydon said Funko was able to secure lower  rent costs because it signed a lease before industrial rents [significantly jumped in the Phoenix metro](https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2022/11/28/arizona-phoenix-industrial-demand-semiconductor.html) and U.S.",

Funko was also looking for more incentives through the city of  Buckeye, but city economic development officials said in emails that  because they already provided incentives to the developer of the Buckeye  facility, that they couldn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;double dip&amp;quot; for Funko with more  incentives.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Prior to this building being constructed, the city  of Buckeye didn&amp;#39;t have any existing speculative buildings to offer  businesses. Therefore, to entice speculative industrial development in  the community, the city entered into a development agreement,&amp;quot; a letter  to the company from the city of Buckeye said in 2021. &amp;quot;The city&amp;#39;s  incentives should have hopefully made the building more competitive in  terms of lease structure.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only other incentives Buckeye&amp;#39;s economic  development team said it could propose were FTZ sites, Opportunity Zones  and New Market Tax Credits. Lydon said Funko was able to secure lower  rent costs because it signed a lease before industrial rents &lt;a href=\"https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2022/11/28/arizona-phoenix-industrial-demand-semiconductor.html\"&gt;significantly jumped in the Phoenix metro&lt;/a&gt; and U.S.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Since Ryan cohen has been alluding to expensive consultants quite frequently. I ran into this article about what happens when these consultants are hired and what happens with a company on the ropes with bankruptcy. \n\nDescribed in this article is about Sanford c. Sigoloff aka Mr. Chapter 11 and his business practices and premium charges.\n\nThis is a very long read\n\nhttps://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/From_the_archive__The_lucrative_business_of_bankruptcy.html\n\n\n\n\nThe lucrative business of bankruptcy\nIn the surge of bankruptcies caused by heavy corporate debt in the '80s, the winners are high-priced consultants hired to close companies. The losers: Workers thrown out of their jobs.\n\nby By Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele, INQUIRER STAFF WRITERS\nPublished Jun 12, 2012\nEditor's note: The following story ran Oct. 21, 1991, on Day Two of the nine-day \"America: What went wrong?\" series published in the Inquirer. \n\n* * *\n\nIt was May 22, 1990, Rosalind Webb's last day of work after more than 30 years at the Bonwit Teller store in Center City.\n\nThe store was one of 14 Bonwit branches that were closing after Bonwit's parent company filed for bankruptcy protection.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nThat morning, Rosalind Webb did what she customarily did - she boarded the No. 48 bus at Allegheny Avenue and 29th Street in North Philadelphia and rode 25 minutes to her job in the shipping department of the store.\n\nSomewhere aloft, Wilhelm Mallory, Steven Hochberg and Peter Dealy did what they customarily do, too.\n\nMallory flew from San Diego to New York, and billed a client $250 an hour for his travel. His associate, Dealy, flew from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and billed $300 an hour. Hochberg flew from New York to Atlanta and charged $150 an hour for his time in the air.\n\nWhat kind of work warrants such fees for sitting in an airplane? The same kind that charges $225 an hour for Richard Schmid to pack and unpack boxes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nMallory, Dealy, Hochberg, Schmid - they are all in a business that reorganizes companies and puts people like Rosalind Webb out of work.\n\nThe bankruptcy business.\n\nIt pays well.\n\nMallory billed $1,250 that day for his five-hour flight. That money - more than Rosalind Webb earned in three weeks - came out of the dwindling cash reserves of a floundering business that was eliminating Webb's job to save money.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nWith the surge in bankruptcies growing out of the excessive debt load that crushed many companies in the 1980s, there are more jobs than ever like those of Mallory, Dealy, Hochberg and Schmid. But there are many millions more people like Rosalind Webb, who have been thrown out of work.\n\nThey are, overwhelmingly, middle-income employees who are being forced into lower-paying jobs, part-time employment, premature retirement or unemployment.\n\nIn the process, they are losing all or part of their pensions and having to settle for reduced benefits, or no benefits at all.\n\nSo it is with Webb, who is now unemployed and must pay $181 a month for medical insurance.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\"All those years I had health insurance and didn't need it,\" she said. ''Now I need it and don't have it. \"\n\nRosalind Webb, like millions of Americans, is snared in an economic shift in the United States in which the middle class is being squeezed and the ranks of the working poor are growing, while new jobs paying up to $500 an hour are being created for a select group of professionals - lawyers, accountants, bankers, investment advisers, brokers and management specialists.\n\nFor all this, you can thank a series of Congresses, presidents and the heads of regulatory and administrative agencies who, during the 1970s and '80s, rewrote the rules governing the tax and bankruptcy systems.\n\nThese changes, along with Congress' failure to enact measures correcting growing inequities in the economy, benefited special interests at the expense of everyone else.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nConsider Congress' handling of two issues - corporate debt and bankruptcy.\n\nWhile making sweeping revisions of the Internal Revenue Code throughout the 1980s, lawmakers agreed to leave intact a provision that allows corporations a virtually unlimited tax writeoff of interest paid on borrowed money. This, even though corporate debt was ballooning to its highest level this century and was being used increasingly to buy and then dismantle companies, not to build them.\n\nThat decision followed an overhaul of the U. S. Bankruptcy Code in 1978 - the first revision in 40 years - that made bankruptcy easier for troubled businesses. Companies were given much more flexibility to stay in business while they attempted to resolve their financial problems.\n\nThe result: a bankruptcy code that encouraged an explosion in corporate bankruptcies brought on, in part, by an explosion in corporate debt that Congress failed to discourage through tax law revisions.\n\nAll this is incorporated in the government rule book, that agglomeration of laws and regulations that, through incentives and disincentives, sanctions and prohibitions, determines the course of the U.S. economy.\n\nMore significant, the ever-changing rule book in large measure determines your place in the economy - whether you are working or not; whether your standard of living is improving or declining; whether you are a member of America's fastest growing group of workers - those earning $100,000 a year and up.\n\nIn the case of bankruptcy, a few numbers compiled from an Inquirer analysis of a half-century of bankruptcy data tell the story.\n\nDuring the 1980s, businesses filed, on average, 63,500 bankruptcy petitions a year nationwide.\n\nThat was up 155 percent over the 24,900 petitions a year filed in the 1970s, and up 302 percent over the 15,800 filed in the 1960s.\n\nThe '80s, in fact, produced the largest growth in bankruptcy cases since the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nNot only is the number of bankruptcies spiraling; so, too, is the size of the companies flocking into Bankruptcy Court.\n\nWhen the Penn Central Transportation Co., parent company of the old Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad, sought protection from its creditors in 1970, it was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history - the first ever to exceed a billion dollars.\n\nFor years, it was the bankruptcy against which all others were measured.\n\nNo more.\n\nSince 1985, more than 50 companies with assets of more than $1 billion each have filed bankruptcy petitions - including nearly a dozen with assets that exceeded Penn Central's $6.9 billion.\n\nThe combined assets of large companies seeking Bankruptcy Court protection ballooned to more than $70 billion last year.\n\nBig-business bankruptcy has become so brisk that a new trend has emerged:\n\nThe repeat bankruptcy customer.\n\nBraniff Inc., the airline, first sought protection in Bankruptcy Court in May 1982. It emerged two years later, in March 1984, but made a return appearance in September 1989. It emerged again in July 1991, and returned for a third time the following month.\n\nContinental Airlines went into Bankruptcy Court in 1983. And again in 1990.\n\nAll this has been a bonanza for the burgeoning bankruptcy industry - the lawyers, accountants and other specialists who charge up to $500 an hour for their time.\n\nThey get paid to fly about the country, from courthouse to courthouse, from business to business. They get paid to talk for a few minutes on the telephone. They get paid to pack files. They get paid to unpack files. They get paid to pick up their mail. They get paid to sort their mail. They get paid to schedule conferences. They get paid to attend conferences. They get paid to keep a list of the conferences. They get paid to keep track of the way they spend their time. They get paid to fill out expense reports.\n\nAnd they get paid to eliminate the jobs of people who work for two weeks to earn what they charge for one hour.\n\n* * *\n\nMeet Ming the Merciless.\n\nHe is otherwise known as Sanford C. Sigoloff, 61, a Los Angeles businessman who describes himself as \"internationally renowned for his work in corporate turnarounds and restructurings. \"\n\nIndeed, newspaper, magazine and television reports have praised his work as a doctor of ailing companies. The New York Times called him one of the ''masters of the corporate turnaround. \" The Los Angeles Times described him as a \"corporate savior. \"\n\nBut employees of companies that Sigoloff has managed remember him better as ''Ming the Merciless. \"\n\nMing, the evil ruler of the planet Mongo in the Flash Gordon serial, is one of the more unsavory characters in science fiction. It is a nickname that Sigoloff relishes, though. In fact, he gave it to himself to signify his single-minded dedication to cost-cutting.\n\nSigoloff and a small group of longtime allies direct Sigoloff &amp; Associates, a \"crisis management\" firm in Santa Monica, Calif., whose clients have fallen on hard times.\n\nIts biggest client to date: L. J. Hooker Corp., the U. S. subsidiary of an Australian real estate company that once had annual revenue of more than $1 billion.\n\nBeginning in 1987, Australian Hooker went on an American buying spree, snapping up such well-known department store chains as Bonwit Teller and B. Altman &amp; Co.\n\nThese and other acquisitions were made, naturally, with borrowed money. So much borrowed money that Hooker quickly collapsed under the weight of its debt and entered Bankruptcy Court on Aug. 9, 1989.\n\nThat same day, Sigoloff, who had been retained to guide the company and its subsidiaries through bankruptcy reorganization, distributed a news release:\n\n\"Daily operations will continue as usual, stores will remain open and transactions . . . will go on just as before the filing. Paychecks will be issued at the same time as if no proceeding had been filed. \"\n\nFour months later, the paychecks began to stop.\n\nFirst, Sigoloff closed B. Altman, the 124-year-old New York-based department store chain with seven stores in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. About 1,700 jobs were lost. Next, he liquidated all but two of Bonwit Teller's 16 stores, eliminating about 2,500 jobs in a department store empire that dated back 94 years.\n\nHe closed all six stores of Sakowitz, the upscale Houston-based retailer that had been in business for 88 years, eliminating 450 jobs. He sold off most of Hooker's real estate holdings, throwing more employees out of work.\n\nHooker employed about 12,000 full- and part-time people in August 1989 when Sigoloff took over.\n\nWhen a reporter asked a Hooker spokesman for the number of people currently employed, he answered:\n\n\"Today the number is 62. \"\n\nReporter: \"6,200? \"\n\nHooker spokesman: \"No, 62. \"\n\nReporter: \"Sixty-two people? \"\n\nHooker spokesman: \"People. Exactly. \"\n\nWhile the 1980s corporate restructuring boom resulted in the loss of 12,000 Hooker jobs, for Sigoloff &amp; Associates, it produced $6.5 million in fees in the first year alone.\n\nAnd the fees continue - such as the ones charged for riding in airplanes.\n\nSigoloff and his colleagues flew often from Los Angeles, near their Santa Monica home base, to New York, Atlanta and other Eastern cities where Hooker had operations.\n\nOn Feb. 12, 1990, Sigoloff flew first class from Los Angeles to New York and billed $500 an hour for the five-hour trip. He also billed two hours' time for a conference that day on Bonwit Teller.\n\nThree days later, on Feb. 15, Sigoloff billed $500 an hour for three hours of phone calls, a one-hour meeting and five hours for \"Travel: New York to Los Angeles. \" For the round trip, he collected $5,000.\n\nIn the first 12 months that Hooker was in bankruptcy, Sigoloff logged about 175 hours in the air, charging more than $90,000 in fees for riding on airplanes. First class.\n\nPeter Dealy, a senior associate, logged 200 hours in the air. Fees for travel: $55,000.\n\nJames M. Van Tatenhove: 250 hours in planes, collecting fees of more than $75,000.\n\nSeymour Strasberg spent 212 hours aloft and billed $60,000.\n\nThe charges are fees billed by Sigoloff &amp; Associates, not necessarily paid directly to those doing the work. Overall, Sigoloff &amp; Associates earned more than $500,000 for time the associates spent in planes during the first 12 months that Hooker operated under the Bankruptcy Court's protection.\n\nThe Sigoloff firm is by no means unique. It is part of a growing fraternity that manages ailing companies and charges such fees.\n\nIn fact, so many management consultants have entered the field that they have formed their own group. It is called, appropriately, the Turnaround Management Association.\n\nThe association, composed of more than 400 managers, consultants, bankers, lawyers and accountants, holds an annual conference and bestows awards on companies deemed the most successful turnarounds of the year.\n\nIts 1990 conference had as its theme, \"Corporate Reconstruction: Managing the Aftermath of the 1980s. \"\n\nJames A. Schuping, the association's executive vice president, foresees a bright future:\n\n\"The misfortune of the economy and a great many of the companies that are suffering right now are to the advantage of our people because that's their specialty. We look for this business failure phenomena to continue well throughout the decade. \"\n\nA look at the billing practices of Sigoloff &amp; Associates offers a glimpse at that future.\n\nPacking and unpacking files, for example.\n\nThat chore led to several thousand dollars in billings by Sigoloff associate Richard Schmid, who managed Hooker's real estate operations in Washington, D. C.\n\nSchmid accumulated the file-packing fees as he prepared to move Hooker's offices in May 1990 from one suburban Washington location to another.\n\nA sampling from his billing logs:\n\nMay 14, 1990 - \"Worked on packing files for office move. \" Schmid billed four hours at $225 an hour, collecting $900.\n\nMay 15, 1990 - \"Monitored removal of certain items of furniture, files and equipment . . . \" Four hours, $900.\n\nMay 17, 1990 - \"Continued selective packing of files for . . . move. \" Two hours, $450.\n\nMay 22, 1990 - \"Pack desk files for Chantilly move. Empty credenza and bookcases - sort files for storage. \" Three and one-half hours, $787.50.\n\nMay 23, 1990 - \"Packing for Chantilly move. \" Four hours, $900.\n\nFinally, on May 24, the move took place, with the Hooker office relocating from Vienna, Va., to nearby Chantilly, Va. After the move, Schmid began a new series of entries on his expense reports:\n\nMay 24, 1990 - \"Unpack boxes and set up at Chantilly. \" Four hours, $900.\n\nMay 29, 1990 - \"Unpack files for use at new office. \" Two hours, $450.\n\nMay 31, 1990 - \"Continue unpacking boxes and set up office space. \" Three and one-half hours, $787.50.\n\nA Sigoloff spokesman, Michael Sittrick, said the firm's fees are reviewed and approved by Bankruptcy Court. As for flying time: \"Sandy said they work while they're on airplanes. His comment was: 'They don't sit and watch movies. ' \"\n\nAs for entries such as \"packing\" and \"unpacking\" boxes, Sittrick said that Richard Schmid might have been searching for financial records.\n\n\"Dick is a terrific financial guy but maybe not a real good time-slip keeper,\" Sittrick said. \"I know Dick Schmid. Dick is a very senior guy. He would have one of his subordinates packing and unpacking boxes. He wouldn't be packing and unpacking. \"\n\nIt should be noted that Schmid's billing practices were in keeping with those of his co-workers, who collected fees for performing seemingly routine tasks.\n\nRichard A. Stemm, who was handling creditors' claims against Hooker, billed $90 an hour to \"return car to airport\" and \"to make travel arrangements\" and to \"rearrange flight, hotel checkout, car return and standby\" for a flight.\n\nAnd then there was the \"master calendar. \"\n\nThat's the schedule of forthcoming meetings, court appearances and other dates affecting the business of L.J. Hooker.\n\nSigoloff &amp; Associates collected thousands of dollars in fees to revise, update and delete information from this schedule.\n\nExcerpts from Bankruptcy Court records:\n\nOn June 14, 1990, longtime Sigoloff associate Wilhelm Mallory, who was overseeing Hooker's retail properties, billed 6 3/4 hours, or $1,688, for ''master calendar task review. \"\n\nSigoloff, the highest-paid member of the firm, billed $500 an hour every time he worked on the calendar.\n\nOn Jan. 5, 1990, he spent an hour on \"master calendar assignments. \" The next day, he billed three hours for work on the \"professional master calendar. \"\n\nThe day after that he collected $3,000 in fees for the \"review of corporate master calendar/professional master calendar . . . \"\n\nOn Jan. 9, it was two hours of fees for \"review of master calendar draft II. \"\n\nThen on Jan. 31, after all the work on the master calendar that month, it was time for what Sigoloff described as \"master calendar cleansing. \"\n\nSigoloff collected fees for working on the master calendar wherever he happened to be. On July 30, 1990, while on the French Riviera, Sigoloff phoned his office to \"review Hooker master calendar. \" For the call, he billed his usual hourly rate - $500.\n\nAs is so often the case in bankruptcy proceedings, some of the most detailed work is keeping track of fees. And there are fees for keeping track of fees.\n\nSigoloff &amp; Associates staff billed thousands of dollars in fees to record their expenses, to fill out time sheets, to prepare an application to Bankruptcy Court for their fees, to appear in court to answer any questions the judge might have about the fee requests.\n\nEvery three months, Sigoloff &amp; Associates petitioned Bankruptcy Court in New York for payment of its fees.\n\nThe compiling, writing, revising and drafting of the final fee application generated yet another round of fees.\n\nOn Nov. 17, 1989, Arthur Cayley billed three hours at $175 an hour for work on the \"fee application. \" Three days later, he billed five more hours for work on the fee application. The day after that, he billed four more hours for work on the application. On Dec. 14, Cayley billed three hours and 50 minutes for giving \"support for fee application. \"\n\nAfter the application was completed, Sigoloff filed it with Bankruptcy Court in New York, seeking $1.8 million in fees and expenses for August through October 1989.\n\n* * *\n\nNot everyone does so well off the bankruptcy boom.\n\nAsk Joyce Buckner, who lost her job as a $6.05-an-hour meat slicer at the Toppers Meat Co. in Sedalia, Mo. The plant was closed in 1990 after Doskocil Cos., a meat processor that owned Toppers, entered bankruptcy.\n\n\"I went to school for a while but financially that wasn't working,\" she said. \"I did try to find work but some of the jobs were at night, and when you have children, it's just not possible. It took about seven or eight months before I found a job. \"\n\nToday, Buckner packages bullets in a plant that manufactures ammunition. ''I'm just there,\" she said, \"because I need the money. The hourly wage isn't that great. It's $5 an hour. Less than what I was making (at Toppers) but a little bit above minimum wage. \"\n\nDoskocil was an American success story until, like so many other businesses, it got caught up in the takeover and debt revolution of the 1980s.\n\nThe Hutchinson, Kan., company had carved out a niche in the highly competitive world of meat packing by making pizza toppings for some of the largest fast-food chains.\n\nDoskocil grew by adding plants, employees and products until 1987, when it decided it wanted to really grow. Not slowly by selling more products and building more plants, but by acquiring a competitor.\n\nWith the help of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment banking firm that is now in Bankruptcy Court, Doskocil sold $50 million in high-risk, high- yield junk bonds to finance an acquisition. The next year it launched a hostile takeover of Wilson Foods, an Oklahoma City meat packer. Wilson was six times larger than Doskocil.\n\nDoskocil had sales of $215 million, compared with Wilson's $1.3 billion. Doskocil had 900 employees, compared with Wilson's 5,000. Doskocil had five plants, compared with Wilson's 12.\n\nWilson had a corporate history dating to 1853, when it was one of the first of the great national meat packers.\n\nDoskocil dated to 1963, when founder Larry Doskocil slaughtered a hog in a former chicken coop on the outskirts of Hutchinson and sold the parts.\n\nNevertheless, the times were such that a small company with access to the easy money of Wall Street could take on larger prey.\n\nAlthough Wilson initially rejected the bid, the Doskocil company eventually won out after a bitter three-month battle.\n\nThe takeover fight generated millions of dollars in fees for lawyers, investment bankers and accountants.\n\nFor Wilson, the price was steep, creating an $11.8 million loss in the last quarter of 1988.\n\nThe Doskocil company formally took control of Wilson in January 1989, firing the president, chief executive officer and more than 100 salaried employees at Wilson's corporate headquarters in Oklahoma City.\n\nJust 15 months later, the deal that took millions of dollars in fees to put together came apart. Unable to sell off parts of Wilson as planned, Doskocil could not pay the interest on the huge debt it took on to buy Wilson. Citing a ''liquidity crisis,\" Doskocil filed for bankruptcy protection on March 5, 1990.\n\nSqueezed for cash, Doskocil sought to lower costs by closing plants or imposing layoffs or wage cuts at other plants.\n\nCarol Jean Smith was one of the casualties.\n\nFor more than six years, she had made meatballs for pizza toppings at the Doskocil-owned Toppers plant in Sedalia, 70 miles east of Kansas City. She earned $6.25 an hour.\n\nThen in May 1990, two months after Doskocil filed for bankruptcy, she lost her job. The Sedalia plant closed. Permanently.\n\nTo Carol Jean Smith and her co-workers, the shutdown came as a shock.\n\n\"We thought the plant was doing OK,\" she said. \"Everyone was always telling us what a good plant it was. Then they began laying off people and we began to wonder if they were going to close the plant. But they said no. They had no plans to do that.\n\n\"But then before it happened, we knew something was up. They began calling people in for a meeting. Even those who were on vacation got a call and were told to come to the plant. The meeting was in the cafeteria. (The manager) read a letter saying they were going to close the plant in two weeks. We were all shocked. We couldn't believe it.\"\n\nSince then, Carol Jean Smith has looked for a job, but hasn't yet found steady work. Meantime, she cleans houses - at $5 an hour.\n\n* * *\n\nIf the Doskocil bankruptcy has been a financial hardship for Carol Jean Smith, Joyce Buckner and others who lost jobs that paid $6 an hour, it has been a windfall for another group of workers.\n\nLawyers, accountants and consultants from across the country have swarmed to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Topeka, Kan., to grab a share of the fees for representing a variety of interests.\n\nNightingale &amp; Associates Inc. of New Canaan, Conn., bills at a rate of $250 an hour as management consultant for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Doskocil.\n\nAndrews &amp; Kurth, a Houston law firm, bills $250 an hour as counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Doskocil.\n\nStutman, Treister &amp; Glatt, a Los Angeles law firm, collects up to $400 an hour as Doskocil's lead bankruptcy counsel.\n\nPaul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, a New York law firm, bills $435 an hour as special counsel for the Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee of Wilson Foods.\n\nPepper, Hamilton &amp; Scheetz, a Philadelphia law firm, bills $260 an hour as attorney for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors' of Wilson Foods.\n\nKensington &amp; Ressler, a New York law firm, bills $220 an hour as counsel for Doskocil.\n\nNot so long ago, such cross-country travel in the pursuit of bankruptcy business was rare. That's because such fees were rare.\n\nUntil Congress rewrote the bankruptcy rule book in 1978, bankruptcy cases were processed in U. S. District Courts, along with other civil cases.\n\nBut most of the daily work was presided over at a lower level by so-called referees, who were appointed by District Court judges.\n\nFees were comparatively modest. So was the number of bankruptcy lawyers.\n\nWhen Congress revised the code, it created a separate Bankruptcy Court to deal solely with bankruptcy cases. Fees closer to the going corporate rate could now be charged.\n\nThe result was predictable: Cases, fees and the number of lawyers specializing in bankruptcy soared.\n\nSo much so that Working Woman magazine has singled out bankruptcy practice as one of the 25 best career choices for women today.\n\n\"Just a few years ago,\" the magazine said in July 1990, \"corporate bankruptcy law, like real estate law before it, was the poor sister of the bar . . . but (the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978) allowed judges to award fees in line with regular corporate rates. Bankruptcy law suddenly became more lucrative, and large law firms that previously had farmed out bankruptcy work to smaller firms began to develop in-house departments. \"\n\nToday, in many jurisdictions, Bankruptcy Court judges routinely approve the fees. Sometimes they explain their reasons.\n\nLike the charges for \"word processing expenses\" billed in 1990 by the New York law firm of Debevoise &amp; Plimpton, which represents L.J. Hooker Corp.'s creditors. These were not stenographic fees, but fees for the use of the firm's computers.\n\nThe law firm billed $25 an hour for its own staff to use its own computers during regular working hours to prepare letters and legal documents, and $50 an hour outside of the normal workday.\n\nArthur H. Amron, a member of the firm, explained the procedure to the court:\n\n\"There's a usage charge, that is an hourly fee for the use of the system. There's an overtime usage by the word processing department outside of the normal hours. That is a charge added on to the usual charge for overtime use. \"\n\nReplied Judge Tina L. Brozman:\n\n\"I think that billing practices citywide have changed. I am not sure that I necessarily agree with them, but if it's standard, I think my mandate is to compensate firms as they are compensated in other matters and not to be niggardly. \"\n\nDuring that particular hearing, at which Brozman approved the awarding of millions of dollars in fees, she did reject one expense item - a $16 tip on an $88 taxi bill turned in by an Australian bank.\n\n\"Take out the tip,\" said Brozman, \"we will deal with it at -\"\n\nAttorney Alan Hyman interrupted with a little Bankruptcy Court levity:\n\n\"It's expensive to take a cab to Australia.\"\n\nAs might be expected, the generous fees have prompted strong reactions from creditors, who get only what's left. Consider those with a stake in the reorganization of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix.\n\nAmerican Continental is the parent company of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association, a California thrift controlled by Charles H. Keating Jr. that was seized by federal regulators in April 1989.\n\nThe American Continental bankruptcy case and related litigation have been a perpetual money machine for scores of lawyers, accountants and other professionals.\n\nOne law firm alone, Wyman, Bautzer, Kuchel &amp; Silbert of Los Angeles, estimated in February 1991 that it had \"devoted approximately 40,000 hours, the equivalent of 20 lawyer years, of professional services\" to the American Continental case.\n\nWhen another law firm filed petitions in Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix, seeking payment of more than $1.5 million in interim fees in the case, a man and woman from Riverside, Calif., wrote the court, complaining that the lawyers were \"asking for money faster than the U. S. Mint can make money.\"\n\nThey were among the thousands of investors, many of them retirees, who had purchased American Continental bonds and who now stood to lose most of their money.\n\nThey argued that if American Continental had \"this kind of money in the bank to pay attorneys, then the investors should be paid off first and the attorneys afterwards.\"\n\nA Westminster, Calif., investor, adding up the fee requests from several law firms, told the court: \"All the available monies will be discharged to counsels and the creditors will be left holding the bag; again.\"\n\nTo be sure, not all Bankruptcy Court judges are so liberal in dispensing fees.\n\nJudge Joseph L. Cosetti, who presides over bankruptcy proceedings in Pittsburgh, has rejected fees for some expenses that New York judges have approved.\n\nAmong them: The charges for word-processing, or computer use, during the bankruptcy reorganization of Allegheny International Inc., a Pittsburgh-based conglomerate.\n\nIn an opinion dealing with fees, Cosetti took special note of the billings for computer time: \"Secretarial time, both regular and overtime, as well as charges for word-processing, are clearly overhead. . . . Therefore, those entries are disallowed. \"\n\nHe also disallowed charges for meals and local cab fares. He cut the hourly fees charged by lawyers, saying they were too high. And he complained that lawyers from the same firm were billing for too much time in office meetings, and that multiple lawyers from the same firm appeared in court.\n\nNonetheless, the fee petitions were so voluminous - as they are in many cases - that Cosetti conceded it was impossible to go over every claim. He wrote:\n\n\"Unfortunately, the court lacks the resources because of its other cases to review, line-by-line, every fee petition filed in this case. The fee petitions which are the subject of this opinion, when stacked together, are over two feet high. \"\n\nLaw firms spend many hours preparing fee applications that even the most conscientious judges lack the time to sift through.\n\nHow many hours?\n\nIn one month, a couple of lawyers and legal assistants in the Atlanta law firm of Trotter, Smith &amp; Jacobs billed 150 hours - at rates up to $215 an hour - to prepare one fee application in the bankruptcy reorganization of Southmark Corp., a Dallas real estate and financial services firm.\n\nHerewith a sampling from Trotter, Smith reports for April 1990:\n\n\"Review . . . of court's Dec. 18, 1989, order to determine date next fee application by Trotter Smith &amp; Jacobs must be filed. \"\n\n\"Drafting . . . of memorandum . . . regarding filing date for next fee application by Trotter Smith &amp; Jacobs. \"\n\n\"Preparation . . . of file containing prior fee application information. \"\n\n\"Conference . . . regarding assignments to individual attorneys for writing narrative summaries to include in application by Trotter Smith &amp; Jacobs for interim award of attorneys' fees. \"\n\n\"Preparation, assembly and review . . . of distribution packets to thirteen billing attorneys . . . regarding the preparation of summaries to be used in connection with the preparation . . . of the third fee application . . . for interim awards and reimbursement expenses. \"\n\nNot too surprisingly, the nation's bankruptcy courts are choking on paper.\n\nKeeping track of hearings attended, hearings rescheduled, letters sent, letters not received, expense reports compiled and expense reports filed, obviously requires a massive amount of record-keeping.\n\nThe cases are so voluminous that they have forced bankruptcy courts to take special steps to handle the flow.\n\nAround the country, bankruptcy courts have limited hours, rented additional space, hired more clerks, restricted access to records, installed telephone answering machines to route the flow of requests, and invoked other emergency measures to try to manage what one Bankruptcy Court official described as a ''tidal wave\" of paper.\n\nIn St. Louis, 10 additional clerks have been hired to deal with the largest bankruptcy in the city's history, Interco Inc., whose holdings include such familiar names as Florsheim shoes and Broyhill furniture.\n\nIn Phoenix, the bankruptcy case of American Continental Corp. is so gargantuan that the clerk's office retained a legal-services management firm, which rented an entire warehouse to store documents that fill nearly 10,000 boxes. That's for one case.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the influx of documents is so great that the clerk's office in Room 906 is beginning to resemble a supermarket, with specialized lanes to handle specific requests.\n\nInside the main door are these signs above the public counter: \"Advanced Request Here,\" \"Return Files Here,\" \"Request Files Here,\" \"Photo Copying\" and \"Cashier. \"\n\nUnlike most supermarkets, however, there are no express lanes in Bankruptcy Court.\n\nIn Manhattan, the Bankruptcy Court clerk's office has created a special division to try to manage the volume of paper produced by a series of massive bankruptcies stemming from the era of easy debt.\n\nUntil four years ago, all bankruptcies - however large or small - were filed in Room 525 on the fifth floor of the historic old U. S. Custom House at the foot of Manhattan.\n\nToday, most still are - except L. J. Hooker, Eastern Airlines, Ames Department Stores, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Integrated Resources, Pan American Airways, Best Products and other mega-bankruptcies. They're in a new office down the hall.\n\nUntil the summer of 1989, Room 510 was a dark, unused storage area, piled high with old furniture from the days that the building was New York's principal custom house.\n\nToday, it looks much like a typical clerk's office found in bankruptcy courts across America. Except that it is handling fewer than three dozen cases. They are so enormous they require a section all their own.\n\n\"The purpose of that room was because we simply could not deal with the public otherwise,\" said Cecilia Lewis, the Bankruptcy Court clerk.\n\nAfter the large cases began to be filed, she said, the court discovered ''there were not enough telephone lines, not enough people, not enough copies of the petition available to give to people. \"\n\nWhat accounts for the runaway growth of paperwork?\n\nIn four words: the government rule book.\n\nWhen Congress rewrote the rule book in 1978 to revise the bankruptcy law, it opened the floodgates to a specialized proceeding called Chapter 11.\n\nUnder the old law, companies in trouble tended to file petitions under a section of the code called Chapter 7. That section provides for the liquidation of the company. Its assets are sold and the proceeds distributed to creditors. The business ceases to exist.\n\nChapter 11 is different. It allows a company to continue operations and existing management to stay in control. The company reorganizes under court supervision, protected from its creditors. Chapter 11 had existed previously, but the new law made it a more appealing option.\n\nIt came at a time of shifting values in the world of business, when bankruptcy began to lose the stigma once attached to it.\n\nThose same shifting values permitted companies to engage in practices they once would have avoided - such as unrestrained borrowing - out of fear of bankruptcy.\n\nAnd they permitted corporate executives whose faulty judgments resulted in the failure of their businesses to seek sanctuary in Bankruptcy Court and, perhaps more important, retain their jobs.\n\nAn Inquirer analysis of a half-century of bankruptcy caseloads shows what happened:\n\nFrom 1976 to 1979, businesses filed, on average, 3,700 bankruptcy petitions each year under Chapter 11.\n\nDuring the 1980s, with the new law in effect, businesses filed, on average, 15,200 petitions each year under Chapter 11. That was an increase of 313 percent.\n\nBy contrast, Chapter 7 petitions rose just 43 percent, from an average of 28,200 to 40,300.\n\nThe dramatic growth in Chapter 11 proceedings - in which a business conducts its affairs under the supervision of the courts and an army of lawyers, accountants and management consultants - brought on the avalanche of paperwork.\n\nAs with so many legislative actions involving the government rule book, lawmakers failed to understand the consequences of their bankruptcy code revisions in 1978.\n\nSen. Malcolm Wallop, a Wyoming Republican, promised that \"no longer will needless litigation in several courts be required to determine all the matters involved in a bankruptcy case. \"\n\nRep. Don Edwards, a California Democrat, hailed the Bankruptcy Reform Act, saying that it \"encourages business reorganizations by a streamlined new commercial reorganization chapter. \"\n\nNo more needless litigation? Streamlined?\n\nAs for the end of litigation, take a look at the bankruptcy proceedings of Integrated Resources Inc., the financial services company that collapsed in February 1990.\n\nThere has been litigation involving unpaid merchandise, breach of contract, unpaid rent, default on promissory notes, fraud and misrepresentation in the sale of partnership interests, securities law violations, fraud and negligence in the sale of investment programs, conspiracy and fraud in the marketing of partnerships, nonpayment of notes, and a class-action lawsuit by stockholders.\n\nThere is so much litigation overall that in 1990 Andrews Publications of Westtown in Chester County, Pa., began publishing a twice-monthly newsletter, the Failed LBO Litigation Reporter, just to report on bankruptcy cases in state and federal courts.\n\nFrank Reynolds of Andrews Publications said that the Failed LBO Litigation Reporter follows major cases with an eye on \"who might be liable for the mess and who is going to sue who and what is the proportion of the liability among various parties. \"\n\nAs for streamlined, take a look at the number of law firms representing some of the interests in the Hooker bankruptcy case.\n\nThere are Attorneys for the Creditors Committee, General Counsel to the Debtor, Special Counsel for Debtor, Attorneys for Debtor, Co-counsel to Debtor, Attorneys for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, Special Local Counsel, Attorneys for Plaintiff, Special Corporate Counsel, Special Counsel for the Debtors Trade Creditors, Consultants for Debtors and Accountants to the Official Creditors' Committee.\n\nAll those committees beget a prodigious volume of paperwork, which, in turn, begets prodigious fees.\n\nWhen the L. J. Hooker Corp., the U.S. division of the Australian real estate company, filed for bankruptcy in New York in August 1989, it submitted one petition for Hooker Corp. - and 14 separate petitions for 14 Hooker subsidiaries.\n\nNow, each time Hooker files an accounting, it submits 15 separate statements covering operations and liabilities.\n\nOne such statement, Document No. 47, is 1,510 pages long, seven inches thick, weighs 10 pounds, and contains the names of 15,000 potential creditors of one Hooker subsidiary - Bonwit Teller.\n\nAt the Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, there is the Southmark Corp., the real estate combine. Instead of 15 subsidiaries, Southmark had 550 subsidiaries and 350 public and private real estate partnerships. The collapse of hundreds of those entities in turn spawned about 850 lawsuits.\n\nIn Phoenix, the bankruptcy cases have grown so large that the Bankruptcy Court was compelled to retain a private firm, Ameriscribe Management Services Inc., to handle the flood of legal documents.\n\nSo it is with the reorganization of Circle K Corp., a convenience store chain based in Phoenix that in 1990 had annual sales approaching $4 billion.\n\nThus far, Circle K has produced nearly 5,000 legal documents - some of which are thousands of pages long - that have been submitted to the court and Ameriscribe.\n\nIt is \"generating huge, huge amounts of paper,\" said Mark A. Scipione, an Ameriscribe official. When the company filed its list of assets and liabilities, Scipione said, they were \"25 volumes long. There were 40,000 pages of creditors. \"\n\n\"We had some people call and say, 'I want that list of assets and liabilities. '\n\n\"And I said, 'Sure, do you want to pick them up with a truck or should I send them air freight?' \"",

The losers: Workers thrown out of their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;by By Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele, INQUIRER STAFF WRITERS\nPublished Jun 12, 2012\nEditor&amp;#39;s note: The following story ran Oct. 21, 1991, on Day Two of the nine-day &amp;quot;America: What went wrong?&amp;quot; series published in the Inquirer. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was May 22, 1990, Rosalind Webb&amp;#39;s last day of work after more than 30 years at the Bonwit Teller store in Center City.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The store was one of 14 Bonwit branches that were closing after Bonwit&amp;#39;s parent company filed for bankruptcy protection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ADVERTISEMENT\nThat morning, Rosalind Webb did what she customarily did - she boarded the No. 48 bus at Allegheny Avenue and 29th Street in North Philadelphia and rode 25 minutes to her job in the shipping department of the store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhere aloft, Wilhelm Mallory, Steven Hochberg and Peter Dealy did what they customarily do, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mallory flew from San Diego to New York, and billed a client $250 an hour for his travel. His associate, Dealy, flew from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, and billed $300 an hour. Hochberg flew from New York to Atlanta and charged $150 an hour for his time in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What kind of work warrants such fees for sitting in an airplane? The same kind that charges $225 an hour for Richard Schmid to pack and unpack boxes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ADVERTISEMENT\nMallory, Dealy, Hochberg, Schmid - they are all in a business that reorganizes companies and puts people like Rosalind Webb out of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It pays well.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mallory billed $1,250 that day for his five-hour flight. That money - more than Rosalind Webb earned in three weeks - came out of the dwindling cash reserves of a floundering business that was eliminating Webb&amp;#39;s job to save money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ADVERTISEMENT\nWith the surge in bankruptcies growing out of the excessive debt load that crushed many companies in the 1980s, there are more jobs than ever like those of Mallory, Dealy, Hochberg and Schmid. But there are many millions more people like Rosalind Webb, who have been thrown out of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are, overwhelmingly, middle-income employees who are being forced into lower-paying jobs, part-time employment, premature retirement or unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the process, they are losing all or part of their pensions and having to settle for reduced benefits, or no benefits at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it is with Webb, who is now unemployed and must pay $181 a month for medical insurance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ADVERTISEMENT\n&amp;quot;All those years I had health insurance and didn&amp;#39;t need it,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Now I need it and don&amp;#39;t have it. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rosalind Webb, like millions of Americans, is snared in an economic shift in the United States in which the middle class is being squeezed and the ranks of the working poor are growing, while new jobs paying up to $500 an hour are being created for a select group of professionals - lawyers, accountants, bankers, investment advisers, brokers and management specialists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For all this, you can thank a series of Congresses, presidents and the heads of regulatory and administrative agencies who, during the 1970s and &amp;#39;80s, rewrote the rules governing the tax and bankruptcy systems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These changes, along with Congress&amp;#39; failure to enact measures correcting growing inequities in the economy, benefited special interests at the expense of everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;ADVERTISEMENT\nConsider Congress&amp;#39; handling of two issues - corporate debt and bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While making sweeping revisions of the Internal Revenue Code throughout the 1980s, lawmakers agreed to leave intact a provision that allows corporations a virtually unlimited tax writeoff of interest paid on borrowed money. This, even though corporate debt was ballooning to its highest level this century and was being used increasingly to buy and then dismantle companies, not to build them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That decision followed an overhaul of the U. S. Bankruptcy Code in 1978 - the first revision in 40 years - that made bankruptcy easier for troubled businesses. Companies were given much more flexibility to stay in business while they attempted to resolve their financial problems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result: a bankruptcy code that encouraged an explosion in corporate bankruptcies brought on, in part, by an explosion in corporate debt that Congress failed to discourage through tax law revisions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All this is incorporated in the government rule book, that agglomeration of laws and regulations that, through incentives and disincentives, sanctions and prohibitions, determines the course of the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More significant, the ever-changing rule book in large measure determines your place in the economy - whether you are working or not; whether your standard of living is improving or declining; whether you are a member of America&amp;#39;s fastest growing group of workers - those earning $100,000 a year and up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the case of bankruptcy, a few numbers compiled from an Inquirer analysis of a half-century of bankruptcy data tell the story.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the 1980s, businesses filed, on average, 63,500 bankruptcy petitions a year nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was up 155 percent over the 24,900 petitions a year filed in the 1970s, and up 302 percent over the 15,800 filed in the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#39;80s, in fact, produced the largest growth in bankruptcy cases since the Great Depression of the 1930s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not only is the number of bankruptcies spiraling; so, too, is the size of the companies flocking into Bankruptcy Court.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the Penn Central Transportation Co., parent company of the old Pennsylvania Railroad and New York Central Railroad, sought protection from its creditors in 1970, it was the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history - the first ever to exceed a billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For years, it was the bankruptcy against which all others were measured.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since 1985, more than 50 companies with assets of more than $1 billion each have filed bankruptcy petitions - including nearly a dozen with assets that exceeded Penn Central&amp;#39;s $6.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The combined assets of large companies seeking Bankruptcy Court protection ballooned to more than $70 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big-business bankruptcy has become so brisk that a new trend has emerged:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The repeat bankruptcy customer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Braniff Inc., the airline, first sought protection in Bankruptcy Court in May 1982. It emerged two years later, in March 1984, but made a return appearance in September 1989. It emerged again in July 1991, and returned for a third time the following month.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Continental Airlines went into Bankruptcy Court in 1983. And again in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All this has been a bonanza for the burgeoning bankruptcy industry - the lawyers, accountants and other specialists who charge up to $500 an hour for their time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They get paid to fly about the country, from courthouse to courthouse, from business to business. They get paid to talk for a few minutes on the telephone. They get paid to pack files. They get paid to unpack files. They get paid to pick up their mail. They get paid to sort their mail. They get paid to schedule conferences. They get paid to attend conferences. They get paid to keep a list of the conferences. They get paid to keep track of the way they spend their time. They get paid to fill out expense reports.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they get paid to eliminate the jobs of people who work for two weeks to earn what they charge for one hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meet Ming the Merciless.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He is otherwise known as Sanford C. Sigoloff, 61, a Los Angeles businessman who describes himself as &amp;quot;internationally renowned for his work in corporate turnarounds and restructurings. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, newspaper, magazine and television reports have praised his work as a doctor of ailing companies. The New York Times called him one of the &amp;#39;&amp;#39;masters of the corporate turnaround. &amp;quot; The Los Angeles Times described him as a &amp;quot;corporate savior. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But employees of companies that Sigoloff has managed remember him better as &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Ming the Merciless. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ming, the evil ruler of the planet Mongo in the Flash Gordon serial, is one of the more unsavory characters in science fiction. It is a nickname that Sigoloff relishes, though. In fact, he gave it to himself to signify his single-minded dedication to cost-cutting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sigoloff and a small group of longtime allies direct Sigoloff &amp;amp; Associates, a &amp;quot;crisis management&amp;quot; firm in Santa Monica, Calif., whose clients have fallen on hard times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its biggest client to date: L. J. Hooker Corp., the U. S. subsidiary of an Australian real estate company that once had annual revenue of more than $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 1987, Australian Hooker went on an American buying spree, snapping up such well-known department store chains as Bonwit Teller and B. Altman &amp;amp; Co.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These and other acquisitions were made, naturally, with borrowed money. So much borrowed money that Hooker quickly collapsed under the weight of its debt and entered Bankruptcy Court on Aug. 9, 1989.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That same day, Sigoloff, who had been retained to guide the company and its subsidiaries through bankruptcy reorganization, distributed a news release:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Daily operations will continue as usual, stores will remain open and transactions . . . will go on just as before the filing. Paychecks will be issued at the same time as if no proceeding had been filed. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Four months later, the paychecks began to stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;First, Sigoloff closed B. Altman, the 124-year-old New York-based department store chain with seven stores in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. About 1,700 jobs were lost. Next, he liquidated all but two of Bonwit Teller&amp;#39;s 16 stores, eliminating about 2,500 jobs in a department store empire that dated back 94 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He closed all six stores of Sakowitz, the upscale Houston-based retailer that had been in business for 88 years, eliminating 450 jobs. He sold off most of Hooker&amp;#39;s real estate holdings, throwing more employees out of work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hooker employed about 12,000 full- and part-time people in August 1989 when Sigoloff took over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When a reporter asked a Hooker spokesman for the number of people currently employed, he answered:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Today the number is 62. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reporter: &amp;quot;6,200? &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hooker spokesman: &amp;quot;No, 62. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reporter: &amp;quot;Sixty-two people? &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hooker spokesman: &amp;quot;People. Exactly. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While the 1980s corporate restructuring boom resulted in the loss of 12,000 Hooker jobs, for Sigoloff &amp;amp; Associates, it produced $6.5 million in fees in the first year alone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And the fees continue - such as the ones charged for riding in airplanes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sigoloff and his colleagues flew often from Los Angeles, near their Santa Monica home base, to New York, Atlanta and other Eastern cities where Hooker had operations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 12, 1990, Sigoloff flew first class from Los Angeles to New York and billed $500 an hour for the five-hour trip. He also billed two hours&amp;#39; time for a conference that day on Bonwit Teller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three days later, on Feb. 15, Sigoloff billed $500 an hour for three hours of phone calls, a one-hour meeting and five hours for &amp;quot;Travel: New York to Los Angeles. &amp;quot; For the round trip, he collected $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the first 12 months that Hooker was in bankruptcy, Sigoloff logged about 175 hours in the air, charging more than $90,000 in fees for riding on airplanes. First class.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Peter Dealy, a senior associate, logged 200 hours in the air. Fees for travel: $55,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;James M. Van Tatenhove: 250 hours in planes, collecting fees of more than $75,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seymour Strasberg spent 212 hours aloft and billed $60,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The charges are fees billed by Sigoloff &amp;amp; Associates, not necessarily paid directly to those doing the work. Overall, Sigoloff &amp;amp; Associates earned more than $500,000 for time the associates spent in planes during the first 12 months that Hooker operated under the Bankruptcy Court&amp;#39;s protection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Sigoloff firm is by no means unique. It is part of a growing fraternity that manages ailing companies and charges such fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, so many management consultants have entered the field that they have formed their own group. It is called, appropriately, the Turnaround Management Association.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The association, composed of more than 400 managers, consultants, bankers, lawyers and accountants, holds an annual conference and bestows awards on companies deemed the most successful turnarounds of the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Its 1990 conference had as its theme, &amp;quot;Corporate Reconstruction: Managing the Aftermath of the 1980s. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;James A. Schuping, the association&amp;#39;s executive vice president, foresees a bright future:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The misfortune of the economy and a great many of the companies that are suffering right now are to the advantage of our people because that&amp;#39;s their specialty. We look for this business failure phenomena to continue well throughout the decade. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A look at the billing practices of Sigoloff &amp;amp; Associates offers a glimpse at that future.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Packing and unpacking files, for example.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That chore led to several thousand dollars in billings by Sigoloff associate Richard Schmid, who managed Hooker&amp;#39;s real estate operations in Washington, D. C.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Schmid accumulated the file-packing fees as he prepared to move Hooker&amp;#39;s offices in May 1990 from one suburban Washington location to another.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A sampling from his billing logs:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 14, 1990 - &amp;quot;Worked on packing files for office move. &amp;quot; Schmid billed four hours at $225 an hour, collecting $900.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 15, 1990 - &amp;quot;Monitored removal of certain items of furniture, files and equipment . . . &amp;quot; Four hours, $900.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 17, 1990 - &amp;quot;Continued selective packing of files for . . . move. &amp;quot; Two hours, $450.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 22, 1990 - &amp;quot;Pack desk files for Chantilly move. Empty credenza and bookcases - sort files for storage. &amp;quot; Three and one-half hours, $787.50.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 23, 1990 - &amp;quot;Packing for Chantilly move. &amp;quot; Four hours, $900.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, on May 24, the move took place, with the Hooker office relocating from Vienna, Va., to nearby Chantilly, Va. After the move, Schmid began a new series of entries on his expense reports:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 24, 1990 - &amp;quot;Unpack boxes and set up at Chantilly. &amp;quot; Four hours, $900.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 29, 1990 - &amp;quot;Unpack files for use at new office. &amp;quot; Two hours, $450.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;May 31, 1990 - &amp;quot;Continue unpacking boxes and set up office space. &amp;quot; Three and one-half hours, $787.50.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Sigoloff spokesman, Michael Sittrick, said the firm&amp;#39;s fees are reviewed and approved by Bankruptcy Court. As for flying time: &amp;quot;Sandy said they work while they&amp;#39;re on airplanes. His comment was: &amp;#39;They don&amp;#39;t sit and watch movies. &amp;#39; &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for entries such as &amp;quot;packing&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;unpacking&amp;quot; boxes, Sittrick said that Richard Schmid might have been searching for financial records.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dick is a terrific financial guy but maybe not a real good time-slip keeper,&amp;quot; Sittrick said. &amp;quot;I know Dick Schmid. Dick is a very senior guy. He would have one of his subordinates packing and unpacking boxes. He wouldn&amp;#39;t be packing and unpacking. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that Schmid&amp;#39;s billing practices were in keeping with those of his co-workers, who collected fees for performing seemingly routine tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Richard A. Stemm, who was handling creditors&amp;#39; claims against Hooker, billed $90 an hour to &amp;quot;return car to airport&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;to make travel arrangements&amp;quot; and to &amp;quot;rearrange flight, hotel checkout, car return and standby&amp;quot; for a flight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there was the &amp;quot;master calendar. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s the schedule of forthcoming meetings, court appearances and other dates affecting the business of L.J. Hooker.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sigoloff &amp;amp; Associates collected thousands of dollars in fees to revise, update and delete information from this schedule.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Excerpts from Bankruptcy Court records:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On June 14, 1990, longtime Sigoloff associate Wilhelm Mallory, who was overseeing Hooker&amp;#39;s retail properties, billed 6 3/4 hours, or $1,688, for &amp;#39;&amp;#39;master calendar task review. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sigoloff, the highest-paid member of the firm, billed $500 an hour every time he worked on the calendar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 5, 1990, he spent an hour on &amp;quot;master calendar assignments. &amp;quot; The next day, he billed three hours for work on the &amp;quot;professional master calendar. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The day after that he collected $3,000 in fees for the &amp;quot;review of corporate master calendar/professional master calendar . . . &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 9, it was two hours of fees for &amp;quot;review of master calendar draft II. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then on Jan. 31, after all the work on the master calendar that month, it was time for what Sigoloff described as &amp;quot;master calendar cleansing. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sigoloff collected fees for working on the master calendar wherever he happened to be. On July 30, 1990, while on the French Riviera, Sigoloff phoned his office to &amp;quot;review Hooker master calendar. &amp;quot; For the call, he billed his usual hourly rate - $500.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As is so often the case in bankruptcy proceedings, some of the most detailed work is keeping track of fees. And there are fees for keeping track of fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sigoloff &amp;amp; Associates staff billed thousands of dollars in fees to record their expenses, to fill out time sheets, to prepare an application to Bankruptcy Court for their fees, to appear in court to answer any questions the judge might have about the fee requests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every three months, Sigoloff &amp;amp; Associates petitioned Bankruptcy Court in New York for payment of its fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The compiling, writing, revising and drafting of the final fee application generated yet another round of fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 17, 1989, Arthur Cayley billed three hours at $175 an hour for work on the &amp;quot;fee application. &amp;quot; Three days later, he billed five more hours for work on the fee application. The day after that, he billed four more hours for work on the application. On Dec. 14, Cayley billed three hours and 50 minutes for giving &amp;quot;support for fee application. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the application was completed, Sigoloff filed it with Bankruptcy Court in New York, seeking $1.8 million in fees and expenses for August through October 1989.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not everyone does so well off the bankruptcy boom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ask Joyce Buckner, who lost her job as a $6.05-an-hour meat slicer at the Toppers Meat Co. in Sedalia, Mo. The plant was closed in 1990 after Doskocil Cos., a meat processor that owned Toppers, entered bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I went to school for a while but financially that wasn&amp;#39;t working,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;I did try to find work but some of the jobs were at night, and when you have children, it&amp;#39;s just not possible. It took about seven or eight months before I found a job. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, Buckner packages bullets in a plant that manufactures ammunition. &amp;#39;&amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m just there,&amp;quot; she said, &amp;quot;because I need the money. The hourly wage isn&amp;#39;t that great. It&amp;#39;s $5 an hour. Less than what I was making (at Toppers) but a little bit above minimum wage. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doskocil was an American success story until, like so many other businesses, it got caught up in the takeover and debt revolution of the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Hutchinson, Kan., company had carved out a niche in the highly competitive world of meat packing by making pizza toppings for some of the largest fast-food chains.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doskocil grew by adding plants, employees and products until 1987, when it decided it wanted to really grow. Not slowly by selling more products and building more plants, but by acquiring a competitor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the help of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment banking firm that is now in Bankruptcy Court, Doskocil sold $50 million in high-risk, high- yield junk bonds to finance an acquisition. The next year it launched a hostile takeover of Wilson Foods, an Oklahoma City meat packer. Wilson was six times larger than Doskocil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doskocil had sales of $215 million, compared with Wilson&amp;#39;s $1.3 billion. Doskocil had 900 employees, compared with Wilson&amp;#39;s 5,000. Doskocil had five plants, compared with Wilson&amp;#39;s 12.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wilson had a corporate history dating to 1853, when it was one of the first of the great national meat packers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doskocil dated to 1963, when founder Larry Doskocil slaughtered a hog in a former chicken coop on the outskirts of Hutchinson and sold the parts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the times were such that a small company with access to the easy money of Wall Street could take on larger prey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Although Wilson initially rejected the bid, the Doskocil company eventually won out after a bitter three-month battle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The takeover fight generated millions of dollars in fees for lawyers, investment bankers and accountants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For Wilson, the price was steep, creating an $11.8 million loss in the last quarter of 1988.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Doskocil company formally took control of Wilson in January 1989, firing the president, chief executive officer and more than 100 salaried employees at Wilson&amp;#39;s corporate headquarters in Oklahoma City.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just 15 months later, the deal that took millions of dollars in fees to put together came apart. Unable to sell off parts of Wilson as planned, Doskocil could not pay the interest on the huge debt it took on to buy Wilson. Citing a &amp;#39;&amp;#39;liquidity crisis,&amp;quot; Doskocil filed for bankruptcy protection on March 5, 1990.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Squeezed for cash, Doskocil sought to lower costs by closing plants or imposing layoffs or wage cuts at other plants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carol Jean Smith was one of the casualties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more than six years, she had made meatballs for pizza toppings at the Doskocil-owned Toppers plant in Sedalia, 70 miles east of Kansas City. She earned $6.25 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then in May 1990, two months after Doskocil filed for bankruptcy, she lost her job. The Sedalia plant closed. Permanently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To Carol Jean Smith and her co-workers, the shutdown came as a shock.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We thought the plant was doing OK,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;Everyone was always telling us what a good plant it was. Then they began laying off people and we began to wonder if they were going to close the plant. But they said no. They had no plans to do that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But then before it happened, we knew something was up. They began calling people in for a meeting. Even those who were on vacation got a call and were told to come to the plant. The meeting was in the cafeteria. (The manager) read a letter saying they were going to close the plant in two weeks. We were all shocked. We couldn&amp;#39;t believe it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since then, Carol Jean Smith has looked for a job, but hasn&amp;#39;t yet found steady work. Meantime, she cleans houses - at $5 an hour.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If the Doskocil bankruptcy has been a financial hardship for Carol Jean Smith, Joyce Buckner and others who lost jobs that paid $6 an hour, it has been a windfall for another group of workers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Lawyers, accountants and consultants from across the country have swarmed to U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Topeka, Kan., to grab a share of the fees for representing a variety of interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nightingale &amp;amp; Associates Inc. of New Canaan, Conn., bills at a rate of $250 an hour as management consultant for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Doskocil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Andrews &amp;amp; Kurth, a Houston law firm, bills $250 an hour as counsel for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Doskocil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stutman, Treister &amp;amp; Glatt, a Los Angeles law firm, collects up to $400 an hour as Doskocil&amp;#39;s lead bankruptcy counsel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp;amp; Garrison, a New York law firm, bills $435 an hour as special counsel for the Official Unsecured Creditors&amp;#39; Committee of Wilson Foods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pepper, Hamilton &amp;amp; Scheetz, a Philadelphia law firm, bills $260 an hour as attorney for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors&amp;#39; of Wilson Foods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kensington &amp;amp; Ressler, a New York law firm, bills $220 an hour as counsel for Doskocil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not so long ago, such cross-country travel in the pursuit of bankruptcy business was rare. That&amp;#39;s because such fees were rare.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until Congress rewrote the bankruptcy rule book in 1978, bankruptcy cases were processed in U. S. District Courts, along with other civil cases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But most of the daily work was presided over at a lower level by so-called referees, who were appointed by District Court judges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fees were comparatively modest. So was the number of bankruptcy lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Congress revised the code, it created a separate Bankruptcy Court to deal solely with bankruptcy cases. Fees closer to the going corporate rate could now be charged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The result was predictable: Cases, fees and the number of lawyers specializing in bankruptcy soared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So much so that Working Woman magazine has singled out bankruptcy practice as one of the 25 best career choices for women today.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just a few years ago,&amp;quot; the magazine said in July 1990, &amp;quot;corporate bankruptcy law, like real estate law before it, was the poor sister of the bar . . . but (the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978) allowed judges to award fees in line with regular corporate rates. Bankruptcy law suddenly became more lucrative, and large law firms that previously had farmed out bankruptcy work to smaller firms began to develop in-house departments. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, in many jurisdictions, Bankruptcy Court judges routinely approve the fees. Sometimes they explain their reasons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like the charges for &amp;quot;word processing expenses&amp;quot; billed in 1990 by the New York law firm of Debevoise &amp;amp; Plimpton, which represents L.J. Hooker Corp.&amp;#39;s creditors. These were not stenographic fees, but fees for the use of the firm&amp;#39;s computers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The law firm billed $25 an hour for its own staff to use its own computers during regular working hours to prepare letters and legal documents, and $50 an hour outside of the normal workday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arthur H. Amron, a member of the firm, explained the procedure to the court:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s a usage charge, that is an hourly fee for the use of the system. There&amp;#39;s an overtime usage by the word processing department outside of the normal hours. That is a charge added on to the usual charge for overtime use. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Replied Judge Tina L. Brozman:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I think that billing practices citywide have changed. I am not sure that I necessarily agree with them, but if it&amp;#39;s standard, I think my mandate is to compensate firms as they are compensated in other matters and not to be niggardly. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During that particular hearing, at which Brozman approved the awarding of millions of dollars in fees, she did reject one expense item - a $16 tip on an $88 taxi bill turned in by an Australian bank.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Take out the tip,&amp;quot; said Brozman, &amp;quot;we will deal with it at -&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Attorney Alan Hyman interrupted with a little Bankruptcy Court levity:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s expensive to take a cab to Australia.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As might be expected, the generous fees have prompted strong reactions from creditors, who get only what&amp;#39;s left. Consider those with a stake in the reorganization of American Continental Corp. in Phoenix.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;American Continental is the parent company of Lincoln Savings &amp;amp; Loan Association, a California thrift controlled by Charles H. Keating Jr. that was seized by federal regulators in April 1989.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The American Continental bankruptcy case and related litigation have been a perpetual money machine for scores of lawyers, accountants and other professionals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One law firm alone, Wyman, Bautzer, Kuchel &amp;amp; Silbert of Los Angeles, estimated in February 1991 that it had &amp;quot;devoted approximately 40,000 hours, the equivalent of 20 lawyer years, of professional services&amp;quot; to the American Continental case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When another law firm filed petitions in Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix, seeking payment of more than $1.5 million in interim fees in the case, a man and woman from Riverside, Calif., wrote the court, complaining that the lawyers were &amp;quot;asking for money faster than the U. S. Mint can make money.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were among the thousands of investors, many of them retirees, who had purchased American Continental bonds and who now stood to lose most of their money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They argued that if American Continental had &amp;quot;this kind of money in the bank to pay attorneys, then the investors should be paid off first and the attorneys afterwards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A Westminster, Calif., investor, adding up the fee requests from several law firms, told the court: &amp;quot;All the available monies will be discharged to counsels and the creditors will be left holding the bag; again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To be sure, not all Bankruptcy Court judges are so liberal in dispensing fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Judge Joseph L. Cosetti, who presides over bankruptcy proceedings in Pittsburgh, has rejected fees for some expenses that New York judges have approved.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Among them: The charges for word-processing, or computer use, during the bankruptcy reorganization of Allegheny International Inc., a Pittsburgh-based conglomerate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In an opinion dealing with fees, Cosetti took special note of the billings for computer time: &amp;quot;Secretarial time, both regular and overtime, as well as charges for word-processing, are clearly overhead. . . . Therefore, those entries are disallowed. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He also disallowed charges for meals and local cab fares. He cut the hourly fees charged by lawyers, saying they were too high. And he complained that lawyers from the same firm were billing for too much time in office meetings, and that multiple lawyers from the same firm appeared in court.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the fee petitions were so voluminous - as they are in many cases - that Cosetti conceded it was impossible to go over every claim. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Unfortunately, the court lacks the resources because of its other cases to review, line-by-line, every fee petition filed in this case. The fee petitions which are the subject of this opinion, when stacked together, are over two feet high. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Law firms spend many hours preparing fee applications that even the most conscientious judges lack the time to sift through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How many hours?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In one month, a couple of lawyers and legal assistants in the Atlanta law firm of Trotter, Smith &amp;amp; Jacobs billed 150 hours - at rates up to $215 an hour - to prepare one fee application in the bankruptcy reorganization of Southmark Corp., a Dallas real estate and financial services firm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Herewith a sampling from Trotter, Smith reports for April 1990:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Review . . . of court&amp;#39;s Dec. 18, 1989, order to determine date next fee application by Trotter Smith &amp;amp; Jacobs must be filed. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Drafting . . . of memorandum . . . regarding filing date for next fee application by Trotter Smith &amp;amp; Jacobs. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Preparation . . . of file containing prior fee application information. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Conference . . . regarding assignments to individual attorneys for writing narrative summaries to include in application by Trotter Smith &amp;amp; Jacobs for interim award of attorneys&amp;#39; fees. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Preparation, assembly and review . . . of distribution packets to thirteen billing attorneys . . . regarding the preparation of summaries to be used in connection with the preparation . . . of the third fee application . . . for interim awards and reimbursement expenses. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not too surprisingly, the nation&amp;#39;s bankruptcy courts are choking on paper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Keeping track of hearings attended, hearings rescheduled, letters sent, letters not received, expense reports compiled and expense reports filed, obviously requires a massive amount of record-keeping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cases are so voluminous that they have forced bankruptcy courts to take special steps to handle the flow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around the country, bankruptcy courts have limited hours, rented additional space, hired more clerks, restricted access to records, installed telephone answering machines to route the flow of requests, and invoked other emergency measures to try to manage what one Bankruptcy Court official described as a &amp;#39;&amp;#39;tidal wave&amp;quot; of paper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In St. Louis, 10 additional clerks have been hired to deal with the largest bankruptcy in the city&amp;#39;s history, Interco Inc., whose holdings include such familiar names as Florsheim shoes and Broyhill furniture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Phoenix, the bankruptcy case of American Continental Corp. is so gargantuan that the clerk&amp;#39;s office retained a legal-services management firm, which rented an entire warehouse to store documents that fill nearly 10,000 boxes. That&amp;#39;s for one case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Los Angeles, the influx of documents is so great that the clerk&amp;#39;s office in Room 906 is beginning to resemble a supermarket, with specialized lanes to handle specific requests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside the main door are these signs above the public counter: &amp;quot;Advanced Request Here,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Return Files Here,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Request Files Here,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Photo Copying&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Cashier. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike most supermarkets, however, there are no express lanes in Bankruptcy Court.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Manhattan, the Bankruptcy Court clerk&amp;#39;s office has created a special division to try to manage the volume of paper produced by a series of massive bankruptcies stemming from the era of easy debt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until four years ago, all bankruptcies - however large or small - were filed in Room 525 on the fifth floor of the historic old U. S. Custom House at the foot of Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, most still are - except L. J. Hooker, Eastern Airlines, Ames Department Stores, Drexel Burnham Lambert, Integrated Resources, Pan American Airways, Best Products and other mega-bankruptcies. They&amp;#39;re in a new office down the hall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until the summer of 1989, Room 510 was a dark, unused storage area, piled high with old furniture from the days that the building was New York&amp;#39;s principal custom house.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today, it looks much like a typical clerk&amp;#39;s office found in bankruptcy courts across America. Except that it is handling fewer than three dozen cases. They are so enormous they require a section all their own.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The purpose of that room was because we simply could not deal with the public otherwise,&amp;quot; said Cecilia Lewis, the Bankruptcy Court clerk.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After the large cases began to be filed, she said, the court discovered &amp;#39;&amp;#39;there were not enough telephone lines, not enough people, not enough copies of the petition available to give to people. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What accounts for the runaway growth of paperwork?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In four words: the government rule book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When Congress rewrote the rule book in 1978 to revise the bankruptcy law, it opened the floodgates to a specialized proceeding called Chapter 11.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Under the old law, companies in trouble tended to file petitions under a section of the code called Chapter 7. That section provides for the liquidation of the company. Its assets are sold and the proceeds distributed to creditors. The business ceases to exist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 11 is different. It allows a company to continue operations and existing management to stay in control. The company reorganizes under court supervision, protected from its creditors. Chapter 11 had existed previously, but the new law made it a more appealing option.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It came at a time of shifting values in the world of business, when bankruptcy began to lose the stigma once attached to it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Those same shifting values permitted companies to engage in practices they once would have avoided - such as unrestrained borrowing - out of fear of bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And they permitted corporate executives whose faulty judgments resulted in the failure of their businesses to seek sanctuary in Bankruptcy Court and, perhaps more important, retain their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An Inquirer analysis of a half-century of bankruptcy caseloads shows what happened:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From 1976 to 1979, businesses filed, on average, 3,700 bankruptcy petitions each year under Chapter 11.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the 1980s, with the new law in effect, businesses filed, on average, 15,200 petitions each year under Chapter 11. That was an increase of 313 percent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Chapter 7 petitions rose just 43 percent, from an average of 28,200 to 40,300.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The dramatic growth in Chapter 11 proceedings - in which a business conducts its affairs under the supervision of the courts and an army of lawyers, accountants and management consultants - brought on the avalanche of paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As with so many legislative actions involving the government rule book, lawmakers failed to understand the consequences of their bankruptcy code revisions in 1978.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sen. Malcolm Wallop, a Wyoming Republican, promised that &amp;quot;no longer will needless litigation in several courts be required to determine all the matters involved in a bankruptcy case. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rep. Don Edwards, a California Democrat, hailed the Bankruptcy Reform Act, saying that it &amp;quot;encourages business reorganizations by a streamlined new commercial reorganization chapter. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No more needless litigation? Streamlined?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for the end of litigation, take a look at the bankruptcy proceedings of Integrated Resources Inc., the financial services company that collapsed in February 1990.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There has been litigation involving unpaid merchandise, breach of contract, unpaid rent, default on promissory notes, fraud and misrepresentation in the sale of partnership interests, securities law violations, fraud and negligence in the sale of investment programs, conspiracy and fraud in the marketing of partnerships, nonpayment of notes, and a class-action lawsuit by stockholders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There is so much litigation overall that in 1990 Andrews Publications of Westtown in Chester County, Pa., began publishing a twice-monthly newsletter, the Failed LBO Litigation Reporter, just to report on bankruptcy cases in state and federal courts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frank Reynolds of Andrews Publications said that the Failed LBO Litigation Reporter follows major cases with an eye on &amp;quot;who might be liable for the mess and who is going to sue who and what is the proportion of the liability among various parties. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for streamlined, take a look at the number of law firms representing some of the interests in the Hooker bankruptcy case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are Attorneys for the Creditors Committee, General Counsel to the Debtor, Special Counsel for Debtor, Attorneys for Debtor, Co-counsel to Debtor, Attorneys for the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, Special Local Counsel, Attorneys for Plaintiff, Special Corporate Counsel, Special Counsel for the Debtors Trade Creditors, Consultants for Debtors and Accountants to the Official Creditors&amp;#39; Committee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All those committees beget a prodigious volume of paperwork, which, in turn, begets prodigious fees.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the L. J. Hooker Corp., the U.S. division of the Australian real estate company, filed for bankruptcy in New York in August 1989, it submitted one petition for Hooker Corp. - and 14 separate petitions for 14 Hooker subsidiaries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now, each time Hooker files an accounting, it submits 15 separate statements covering operations and liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One such statement, Document No. 47, is 1,510 pages long, seven inches thick, weighs 10 pounds, and contains the names of 15,000 potential creditors of one Hooker subsidiary - Bonwit Teller.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At the Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, there is the Southmark Corp., the real estate combine. Instead of 15 subsidiaries, Southmark had 550 subsidiaries and 350 public and private real estate partnerships. The collapse of hundreds of those entities in turn spawned about 850 lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Phoenix, the bankruptcy cases have grown so large that the Bankruptcy Court was compelled to retain a private firm, Ameriscribe Management Services Inc., to handle the flood of legal documents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it is with the reorganization of Circle K Corp., a convenience store chain based in Phoenix that in 1990 had annual sales approaching $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus far, Circle K has produced nearly 5,000 legal documents - some of which are thousands of pages long - that have been submitted to the court and Ameriscribe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It is &amp;quot;generating huge, huge amounts of paper,&amp;quot; said Mark A. Scipione, an Ameriscribe official. When the company filed its list of assets and liabilities, Scipione said, they were &amp;quot;25 volumes long. There were 40,000 pages of creditors. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We had some people call and say, &amp;#39;I want that list of assets and liabilities. &amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And I said, &amp;#39;Sure, do you want to pick them up with a truck or should I send them air freight?&amp;#39; &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Do you understand his point of view?|HELL YES. Your father knew how to WRITE. The Executives were amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing typewriters because they supported PROPORTIONAL LETTER SPACING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I get shivers just thinking about that. Their only drawback was the inability to swap typefaces, but other then that, the print and text is BEAUTIFUL. Especially some of the lesser available typefaces (the names of which currently elude me). Amazing, and considerably reliable. Also easier to service, as they were more traditional typewriters with typebars and not the Selectric Golf Ball Element.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nI understood none of this, but the sheer joy and passion of it made me feel happy.|Hahahahaha yes, I am a nerd. Most typewriters are monospaced, meaning each character occupies the same amount of space. A period and the M would both be spaced the same. Proportional spacing is what you're reading right now. The period takes up much less space than the M. The Executive is one of only three (i believe) proportional typewriters. It had six escapement, with the smallest character occupying two units, and the largest occupying around 5. Made for some lovely typography.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\n[removed]|I haven't been able to acquire one yet, but just looking at the work they make makes my mouth water. Is that normal?\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\n[removed]|Uh, I think you might be, but don't worry you're not alone!!!\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nI'm getting so many Sheldon on the Valentines train ride vibes from this thread it's scary! edit: spelling|Might you be able to elaborate? Is it a good thing?? Lol\n^(the below is another reply to the third answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nWe don't kinkshame here.|well, I guess beautiful typography is my kink....\n^(the below is another reply to the reply to the third answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nWhat if kink shaming is my kink? __________________ Then shame on you.|what even is reddit.... IDK if this'll help, but shame...shame on all of ye. Just roll around in all that shameful shame. Just like that... how shameful\n^(the below is another reply to the second answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nProportional fonts are a nice upgrade, but their interword spacing is still fixed. The real mechanical marvels were the typesetting machines. Unfortunately, getting a working Linotype or Monotype may be a bit excessive, and then there's the lead poisoning to worry about...|The Linotype machines always amazed me. Most of them got destroyed with the advent of computer typesetting in the 80s. Just heard of a guy who got two of them! Truly wonderful machines...the Verityper was also a magnificent beast, called a cold typesetting machine. It was a typewriter which later had proportional, but also allowed you to switch through multiple typefaces with a dial, based on the brilliant Hammond Typewriter that was invented in 1888. James Hammond was the man!!!\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nI saw a Linotype in action at a print museum (Museu Nacional da Imprensa) in Porto (Portugal) - they had everything working, apart from the lead casting (for health and safety reasons). It was an astounding sight, and I spent well over an hour admiring and studying the contraption.|Shame, they could have cast tin!!\n^(the below is another reply to the second answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nWas there letter specific kerning? Like did a W followed by a d have the d closer to the W than another W because of the space under the angle?|every character was assigned a specific amount of subspaces so that they would be even with the neighboring letters on other sides. Other then that, I'm not sure what you are asking\n^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nI thought the Selectrics also supported proportional letter spacing. I took typing in junior high on a Selectric and I must not have noticed.... I think what it really came down to was he wanted to feel himself hitting the paper one letter at a time. The Selectrics don't give you that satisfaction, even though they're faster. He was old enough he started his career on a manual....he ended up giving that machine to me as a toy when I was a kid. You really, really had to punch it. Wish I could remember the model- all I remember is the color, turquoise blue. He replaced the Executive with a Leading Edge word processor in 1986 and wrote 15 more books on PCs, but I'll always remember him in front of a typewriter. Thanks for responding!|No problem, thank you so much for sharing! I love hearing about peoples experiences with these machines. Honestly you have to type pretty damn fast to notice a speed difference. Even the selectric may not be the fastest. The Praxis is damn fast. I peak at 153wpm. On a manual typewriter its about 120. There certainly is a detriment with the higher key travel, but some people could pound along on manuals at close to 200. Mindblowing.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nDad and I were both north of 110 wpm, pretty sure he was around 130-135. Fast enough to notice the lag.|The lag is mostly in the return I feel. The selectric takes its time. That's where the Praxis shines, it returns fast!\n&amp;#x200B;|That's pretty fast!!\n^(the below is another reply to the 11th answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nHere I thought I was fast because I peaked at 90 on a regular keyboard 😐|Hey that's pretty good!!! Average is 45\n^(the below is another reply to the reply to the original answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nNot the selectric - it could only switch between 10 and 12 characters per inch - but IBM made an electronic golfball typesetter called the “Composer” that had a memory and proportional spacing. It would print in much higher quality than the standard golfball selectric.|IBM experimented with a lot of magnetic memory systems and card readers. Like the memory writer. They had some cool stuff happening!\n^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nHelvetica. My boss in 1972 ordered one with Hevetica since he hated the standard courier/times new roman font|Helvetia is hard to come by on typewriters\n^(the below is another reply to the original question)|​&amp;#x200B;\nLol, my father was an IBM Selectric repairman. I don't know how he felt about the model D, but I know that Selectrics broke often enough that he always had plenty of work. _________________ The price difference between the two was equivalent to around $1K today. Historians don't make bank, so it seemed eccentric at the time. He used the crap out of it; no question he got his money's worth.|I have people still pounding away on the selectric! Last one I serviced had gone 15 years since it was last checked.\nHave you come across any mechanical DVORAK typewriters, and if so how often do you see them?|I have only seen one DVORAK typewriter, it was a custom mod by a talented IBM selectric tech. Otherwise, they are very rare. I have heard rumors of two manuals out in the wild, but QWERTY was the layout that took the Americas by storm. Keyboard layouts change by languages, and DVORAK was designed to work well with English as it's based on key frequency percentages. It is a tricky modification to do, but not impossible!!\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nGroovy, I have been using DVORAK on my keyboard for years and was curious how possible it was to find a typewriter. Thank you for the info : D|No problem! Forewarning, it wouldn't be a cheap conversion!\n^(the below is another reply to the reply to the original answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nIs Dvorak worth messing with if one never learned to type the \"correct\" way, i.e. just using 2-3 fingers on each hand? I can type fairly fast in my own style - I did Mavis Beacon and some other things through the years to try to re-train myself, but have never been able to un-learn my unique system.|I'll be honest, there is no real speed difference between the two unless you are at world record speeds around 300wpm, where it would be too slow to move your fingers to another row to type a common letter. Most normal people can get along well on either layout, and will never ever notice a perceivable speed difference.\n^(the below is another reply to the reply to the reply to the original answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nI can't think of a context other than competitive typing if that's a thing, where typing any faster than the average typing speed of most office workers would give you any edge. __________________________ well you need to type pretty fast when for example writing down stuff that is said in court or sth. tho i think today they use some weird specialised keyboards that are very different looking from normal ones. also would be useful to type fast when you are in studies and taking notes of what is said.|The court machines are called stenographs, and they write in shorthand by allowing the user to press multiple paddles at the same time to generate entire words or phrases.\n^(the below is another reply to the reply to the reply to the original answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\n[deleted]|Ah those split ones, yes. Sometimes I will hit a right side key with my left hand! I could never\n^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nThe only way to do DVORAK on a selectric would be to make a custom golf ball wouldn't it?|Not at all. You'd need to understand how a selectric works. You can do DVORAK with standard balls. Each ball has rows and columns, and there is a rotate and tilt mechanism that indexes a letter. That is all controlled by the Wiffel Tree, a 6 bit binary to mechanical decoder. The keys themselves press down on a series of interposed rods which correspond to the yes no input of binary. It's that input that drives the letters. The interposed rods run the entire length of the keyboard, so all one needs to do, is shuffle around the appropriate key latch leavers, and then swap the key caps. The A latch rod will always pull the interposers to correspond with the binary input for the letter a, regardless of its position on the keyboard. I will say that the key leavers are independent of the latch rods (I believe) so that should also allow you to move letters down rows as well.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nInteresting - I knew the theory behind it, I assumed the key latch levers wouldn't be interchangeable. I'm keeping my eye out to buy a selectric one day, not because I need one, but just because I want to take it apart. I've read they use a bunch of ball bearings as an interlock to block multiple keypresses at once which is pretty clever.|Yes! It is a very interesting machine.\n^(the below is another reply to the original question)|​&amp;#x200B;\nUsually (based on a sample of one) if you use dvorak you are already touchtyping so might as well get blank keys 😁|My laptop keyboard existed scrambled forever, I touch type, didn't need the letters\n^(the below has been split into two)|​&amp;#x200B;\nWhat do you think about the LEGO typewriter?|The lego typewriter, boy. I blogged about that one in length, but in short I was very impressed. There were a few areas where I thought the design could have been better, but the overall mechanics (being lego) impressed me. Especially the escapement. A brilliant blend of technics and system that emulated some of the real life mechanical components of the typewriter! Overall aesthetics were cool too, reminded me a lot of some Depression era machines like the Royal Signet.\nAny chance you get to work on an item from the Tom hanks collection?|Yes.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nAny link to this blog I’m certain the group over at /r/lego would appreciate it|Hey, will do!\nDude, this is so cool. My dad was a typewriter mechanic from like 1970-90. I wish he was still around, I know he’d have a ton to ask you about how things have changed in the biz. To my actual question: You mentioned the Model M is your daily driver when using a computer. Have you tried any of the newer mech switches and, if so, do you have any favourites that could compete with the buckling springs on the M?|I will follow up and say things have changed a lot in the biz! Especially from what I hear from older techs, and what I uncover from the archeology of sorts while working. Even older clients. The internet has been an amazing resource to buy, sell, connect, and find parts. There is a flip side, none of these things are made or done anymore, so parts and expertise is hard to come by. Things have gotten a lot more coveted, even in the past 5 years. Key ring remover pliers now fetch $300 apiece. Crazy.\n&amp;#x200B;|I'm not a keyboard guy, I feel like I'm the wrong person to ask about this lol. I grew up on a cheap Dell keyboard, but I loved it. I wanted something that bridged typewriters more closely with computers. And it was hard to argue with the legacy of the M. With so many keyboards and switch types available, I'm sure there are others out there that I would like, but I feel like the buckling spring is the most tactile.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nThe “springhook” was my favourite tool when I was a Customer Engineer in IBM Office Products group in 1977-1980...|I use a snag fixer, but yes! Invaluable\n^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nWow $300. My father was a CE. I have all sorts of odd specialty tools laying around. I also have an Executive typewriter that I think he restored. He was fixing typewriters when he first started with IBM in the late forties.|I know some old IBM guys who have the old tools. I have a pair of IBM pliers sitting around. Never use them because I don't know what they do lol\n^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nFWIW I have a cheap Dell buckling spring keyboard and it's awesome. I'd still be using it but my latest rig doesn't have a PS/2 port.|I had no idea dell made buckling springs!!!! The other reply yes, hit that up. I use a PS/2 to USB for my IBM and its fantastic. I can't out type it! Can't believe they got rid of a perfectly good connector. I don't get it. The IBM personal system 2 was actually the second computer to feature the model m. Don't recall the name of the first bit it's lesser known. The predecessor to that board came out on the IBM 5150, a legend among computing, and had the Model F board. Really the best computer at the time, beating the Apple II and everyone else until Apple released the macintosh in 84.\nI would imagine these days it's a very specific profession, do you see a lot of business?|I do indeed! I am currently backlogged about six or seven machines. Just had a lady drop off two machines for repair this morning. A lot of writers, enthusiasts, etc use them. Not just collectors!! They're still in professional use.\n^(the below is another reply to the original question)|​&amp;#x200B;\n[deleted]|You'd be surprised! I certainly am and I'm the one doing it lol\nMy grandfather was the inventor of the golf ball on the selectric for IBM, I've got the 1 millionth Electric Selectric in my den, of course it doesn't work......can you fix it? https://www.nap.edu/read/4779/chapter/5 https://imgur.com/RoKkuWI https://imgur.com/6L13Pwq|Hell yes I can! Probably. Hit me up, no idea how you wanna get it to me, but it sounds like a badass project! I'm down :)\n^(the below is another reply to the original question)|​&amp;#x200B;\nHoly fuck that's awesome. How has it gotten to that condition though? Even if it doesn't work you should get it looking ship shape, its a baller.|It will live again, just let me at it lol\nHave you ever seen Fringe (sci-fi show)? There's a typewriter repair shop that's featured several times in the early seasons, along with an old typewriter with an offset Y. Watching that show, I always wondered if such shops still existed. And I'll never forget the carriage return sound from all those Jr. High reports. I'm weirdly glad you do what you do!|thanks man! I'm living the dream as long as it'll carry me! I have not seen that show, but now I am interested.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nFringe is an awesome show. When I saw your AMA, I thought the same thing about the typewriter repair shop. Worth watching the show besides.|I gotta check it out!!! Wonder if it's a real shop...maybe I know them....\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nYea, put the typewriter down and go binge Fringe. You will not regret it. Then find yourself an IBM Selectric 251|HA! thanks for the show rec!\nHow curled is your mustache and how is it in Portlandia these days?|I'm 21, too young for a nice curly mustache!!\nHow often does Tom Hanks call you?|Tom Hanks is a wonderful person :)\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nDon't let any [Qanon tell](https://eu.heraldtribune.com/story/opinion/2020/09/22/qanon-zany-rehashing-anti-semitic-lore-inspired-holocaust/5852008002/) you otherwise.|Ouch, hope `u/kirtaner-420chan` takes care of them!!!\n[deleted]|Probably just needs to be cleaned a little, then lubed. Check where the platen ratchets. That is likely the problem area. You could also have an issue with the repeat key sticking.\nAny reason why you exclude the Corona 4 from your repair list?|You NOTICED. That little ffff...... uuuu yeah. It's a pos. Finicky, poor access for adjustments, weak components, foolhardy mechanisms, not to mention I got screwed out of a lot of money involving some of those when I first started out. I hate them, they hate me, end of story.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nHaha, yeah I bought a while back and would love to get it in working order ([pics](https://imgur.com/a/cpmYI)) but it was beyond my non-existent skill level. I do have another model (I think it's an underwood) in storage that I would like to get up and running as well. I'll reach out once I can locate it!|no thanks lol\n[removed]|I listen to a lot of music, I love it. My personal favorite has always been the Illinoise album by Sufjan Stevens.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nThoughts on the new Sufjan tunes that came out a few days ago?|I am enjoying his newer album, not as much as his earlier work though. I feel like his style has evolved greatly, which is a good thing, that's growth, it just doesnt hit me like it used to!\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nCarrie and Lowell is his finest work in my opinion. It harkens back to his earlier stuff, but the musicianship and production are top tier. Also, yay typewriters! Thanks for the AMA.|I love that album as well, there are some tracks that I find really beautiful, like Beloved of John, and Blue bucket of gold (I think those are the names)? But for me, illinoise will always be the masterpiece.\nI thought you might enjoy a typewriter story. My wife's father worked for Smith-Corona. There was a bunch of abandoned parts in the warehouse, and he asked his supervisor if he was able to build typewriter from those parts, could he keep it. The supervisor agreed, thinking there was no way to make anything from that mishmash of parts. He did it! That was my wife's high school graduation present, and she used it all through college. We still have it and it still works great. Personally, I grew up near Endicott (home of IBM) and learned to type on a Selectric. Keep up the good work. I'll ask a question just so the mods don't delete this: Do you need any specialized tools to be a typewriter technician?|I am absolutely in love with that story! Reminds me of that one Johnny Cash song where he builds a Cadillac by stealing the parts. Excellent story, cherish that machine!!! It is not an easy feat, that's for sure, and takes a special kind of genius. As far as your question goes, yes and no. I cant seem to find specialized tools, i really just need those keytop removers, but nowadays they are $300 a pair. I did recently aid in the creation of a screwdriver set made by chapman to specifically work on typewriters. Excellent set, and a worthy project. A must have for any typewriter tech! Other than that, I have made do.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nWell, since we’re telling our father’s typewriter stories… After the war, my father was temporarily assigned to repair IBM typewriters in huge typing pool for the Social Security Administration. The pool consisted of 150 IBM typewriters, 150 Remington and 150 Smith Corona. I imagine the noise was deafening. Each company had one repairman who spent the entire day roaming around fixing machines. The SSA would only hire typists who were war widows or the wives of disabled veterans.|Thanks for the story, that's fascinating!\nDo you use Interrobang at all ‽‽!!‽‽ or ¡¡¿¿??!! I always lose upside down interrobang.|I have not! But you can always type a ? and backspace with a ! over it. Or if you dont have !, type a period and backspace an apostrophe over it. For upside down, find a Hispanic typewriter.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nI tried but they're not aligned so it looked bad|varies by machine. You can hold the carriage release and line it up carefully yourself!!\n&amp;#x200B;|http://imgur.com/gallery/lY4tUgn\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nSo clean, I'll show you how mine fucks it up in an hour|LOL\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nhttps://imgur.com/a/xTyFp34 The first one came out fine for some reason -- usually it's like the second two, where there's ghosting of the question mark (though when I looked it up to check that was the right term, it seems that might be my fault for typing wrong). I've got some gripes with the machine, I'll send you in a PM for advice.|Yeah, no two typewriters are equal. I had a designated exclamation on mine so I kinda cheated. You don't have to type the period since the dot is already there for the question mark\nWould it be worth shipping a 1950ish Royal to you for a repair?|That is up to you. 1950? Sounds like an FP. An INCREDIBLY fine writing machine. You'd foot the bill both ways, plus the $20 deposit and the repair. One of the best royal standard typewriters ever made! I wrote with one for a few years, sold it sadly last week.\nWhat’s a typewriter?|Isn't that the million dollar question my man. A typewriter, well, its...how do I put this.. a machine that writes, by typing.\n&amp;#x200B;|But in all seriousness, it's a mechanical machine that is designed to print letters in emulation of printed type by allowing a user to input specific characters. There's too many different types to really group a definition, so it really truly is a machine that writes by typing, where type is what we consider to be a solid impressionable character that delivers ink to a medium in the shape of a legible character.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nSo... like a computer?|Yes, and also no. Typewriters are single purpose, and manual typewriters dont need electricity. They are mechanical and operate solely by human input.\n^(the below is another reply to the original answer)|​&amp;#x200B;\nCan I play games on it?|Yes! Tic tac toe, hangman, uh.... you can have contests to see how far you can throw them.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nThen I call you, right? This man’s a genius!|Yep!!! I tell all the new owners to throw them lol. The hustle is real!\n^(the below is another reply to the original question)|​&amp;#x200B;\nA reverse iPad|this guy\\^\nYou mentioned youre using a vintage keyboard to type this, are you into mechanical keyboards or would you say you’re particular about the kind of keystrokes you like the most, be it typewriter or modern keyboard?|I am very fickle about the feel of my keyboards. I got the IBM because I wanted a nice tactile feel. I HATE those flat laptop pos's. As far as typewriters go, I hates silents. While I like the lower noise, the silencer mechanisms all rely on a deceleration mechanism that I feel negatively impacts the feel. I like a smooth action, a sharp strike, and a quick rebound. 1930s Royal Portables are great, and I LOVE the Olympia SM3.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nYou need to join us in the madness over at r/mechanicalkeyboards!|Oh no....I'm not sure lol\nWhat's your preferred method of dealing with an old, hardened platen? Chicago here too, btw. I've got an Olivetti Lettera 32 and a Royal O Portable.|There is no good way to \"rejuvenate\" rubber. It is a material that constantly degrades. I replace the rubber via J.J. Short. Generally if it is in good shape and feeds paper well, I leave it alone. It is not something that is always necessary\n^(the below is another reply to the original question)|​&amp;#x200B;\nThis. I have a Hermes Baby with a hardened platen and would love to restore.|Not hard to work on at all! Send the platen off for best results. I would not recomend turbo platen. Right now JJ short is really the only place.\n^(the below is another reply to the reply to the original question)|​&amp;#x200B;\nis thata a Hermes......Baby!!! a Hermes model Baby or a model Hermes Baby?? _________________ [This model](https://youtu.be/C1JmyM6Tf5g). The Hermes Rocket was a name for a nearly (possibly completely) identical model.|I will confirm that they are completely identical.\n^(the below is another reply to the original question)|​&amp;#x200B;\nWhat sort of problems does hardened platen cause?|They will either not feed the paper well, rarely damage the ribbon or wear on the type, or simply crack and fall apart. The type is hardened steel so I wouldn't worry about that, but it can cut holes in your ribbon or even the paper.\nWhat is your favorite typewriter and why do you like it best?|Well, I have become the leading expert in the Williams typewriter co. I think it is one of the most unique and beautiful machines ever made.\n&amp;#x200B;|For typing, I love my Royal P from 1930, and my 50s Olympia SM3. They have that nice smooth feel and sharp rebound that I like, while printing super crispy and clean!\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nSeems amazing for a 21 year old to become the leading expert in a class of typewriters. Good going. Prior to Typewriters what sorts of thing interested you ? Was there another topic you got heavily entrenched in ?|Oh god lol. I was OBSESSED with the ocean. Oceanography, marine biology, even shipbuilding. This was all before the age of 10. No sports or video games for me. Only fish. I consumed every YouTube video, book, and documentary. I watched finding Nemo so many times the VHS tape corrupted. It was my dream to become a marine biologist, I loved everything about it. I also had no friends, I mean, no kindergarteners were interested in sea surface currents and migration patterns, or the food sources for chemosythesizing organisms populating the hydrothermal vents. I looked up to Robert Ballard too! The guy who found the titanic (another obsession) For about 12-13 years I kept both freshwater and saltwater tanks. I sold my tank this summer, sad moment, I miss keeping fish considerably. But you know, dreams die out. I also wanted to be an artist but I don't think I have what it takes! I also had a long invested interest in photography! I love film photography :)\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nThis is the best response so far, IMO. I respect OP's current love for all things typewriter, but this one hit me hardest. I think most of us had obsessions when we were young. Myself, I wanted desperately to be an astronaut. (I am not an astronaut today.) It's great to see someone in love with their current pursuit and simultaneously acknowledging they grew up loving something else.|Hey thanks for that! And ya know, I still love fish. I'm not going to be a biologist by any stretch, but I'll never stop loving the ocean. Getting rid of that tank wasn't easy. I'm still passionate about it, but just not in a way I can pursue.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nYou could have a Viking funeral for typewriters you hate — and thus two world collide.|Yes, I will do such for the royal classic of 2020\nYou need to get in touch with `u/jamescookartwork` https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ocuzhs/i_make_drawings_using_the_letters_and_numbers/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf|I am familiar with him, as well as multiple other type artists! I sold a Greek keyboard machine to one a while back and have dabbled in it myself!\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nHey, other question - if you were to design a ‘modern’ typewriter from scratch, what would ‘modern’ typewriter mean to you and what kinds of features would you include?|It would be more artistic. I toyed around with the idea of a single element so one could swap type. It would also be portable, I love the Williams design. A non rotary escapement would be fun, glass keytops obviously, maybe octogon, maybe square, a polished metal body with leather accents.... something that looks modern, but is well machined. Who knows?\nIs 3D printing useful for replacement parts for vintage typewriters?|Yes, some people use rubberized mediums for feet! A buddy of mine, Steve dade, made the best rubber feet in the business. He passed away recently so a lot of folks are turning to printing. I've also used it to replace a lot of platen knobs.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nSorry about your friend.|Thanks, he will be missed\nInteresting. I was a IBM OPCE (Office Products Customer Engineer) in the late Seventies but switched to repairing electronic devices (terminals, printers, PCs). It was only after I stopped repairing mechanical typewriters that I realised that the mechanical devices had one major advantage over electronic devices; you could see for the most part what was wrong. Even adjustment and repairs were easier. Are parts still available for the IBM golfball typewriters?|Parts are available! I have a fair bit, and you can still find NOS if you know where to look. I even have a can of the original Topaz Bronze touchup paint! Usually parts machines are the source nowadays.\nNoticed the medium format film border. What’re you shooting with?|Sharp eye! Portra 400 on my Hasselblad 500c. I since sold that camera and got a CM, but miss my C.\nWhat are some good sources to purchase vintage typewriters?|Anyone reputable. I mean, me lol. I can also recomend Gramercy, Berkeley, Messa, and Cambridge typewriter to support brick and mortar. Also Tampa, Nashville, And Stephentown typewriter. There's typewritermuse in LA, Phoenix typewriter, typewriter justice, unplug typewriter co...and a few others I might be forgetting. For canada check out Yeg typewriters. Mexico and spain there is ElGranero typewriter, Mr. And Mrs. Vintage for the UK, northern Europe, and Australia. Also Charlie foxtrot. I'm sure I'm missing some but I know all these guys and they're legit!! Ken from california California typewriter (the tom hanks doc) works at Berkeley now. Stay away from Colombo collection for one. She does bad work, unreliable, overpriced, and rips off good techs like me. Jon posey is a pedophile stay away, but he doesnt sell much. Uhhhh on other guy who was a weasel, typewriter collection or something. Eh, cant avoid them all!\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\n[deleted]|It's not publicized. And frankly I'm trying to stay out of the middle of it. Just the things he did to me personally, and to others I know including a minor who had it the worst. Some people are just a little fucked up.\n&amp;#x200B;|As far as photography, I love my hasselblad, I process 120 and 135 at home. Both black and white and C41. I also have an enlarger where I make black and white prints, but have yet to dive into RA4 color printing.\nWhat kinds of people make up your customer base?|Oh boy. Small office workers, authors, poets, artists, business owners, collectors, and anyone who needs or uses typewriters. Even inmates.\nI'm a little older than you. My first job (in the '50s) was typing envelopes for advert mailers on a [1930's Underwood exactly like this](https://img1.etsystatic.com/000/0/5340102/il_fullxfull.310016341.jpg). I really loved that machine, bitch though it was. I think it weighed more than I did. Is there any chance I could find one today and buy it? I'm sure it would cost much more than the original!|Underwood 5, I have had many. You can find them all over, the most mass produced typewriter in the states basically. They made millions! They can be had anywhere from $5 to $500, though I wouldn't pay more than 300 for one in superb shape, and 500 max for absolutely beyond mint. $150 is a fair price to pay for working, and I'd charge about $200 for one I've serviced. I am currently repairing one for a client who does sales. Check out the Vintage Mancave on etsy, he may be selling one, and I may have worked on it.\nIn your opinion is there likely to be a *good* new typewriter ever brought to market? Not like the plastic thing at Michaels|No, not at all. And its complicated why. Royal released that Michaels one as the Royal Classic. I've used it, it sucks. The epoch is bad too. Back in the day, a good mid sized typewriter like the 1960s Remington Quiet-Riter cost an equivalent 1600$ in today's money. It was solid steel. The Royal Classic retails at around $200. There is no possible way a company can make money on a high quality machine, they simply cost way more to make than people these days are willing to pay. They were the laptops of the era, in price too. Back when the typewriter was the only method of print writing available, the price was justified much like it is for a computer today. All that manufacturing now has to be packed in as cheaply as possible to retail at a fraction of the price in a market that already has plenty of amazing machines.\n&amp;#x200B;|In short, it isnt going to happen on a commercial scale. I myself have thrown around designs and concepts for a new machine, but they would all need to be hand made, and the price would be outrageous.\nCan you tell me more about this typewriter that I bought for my daughter? She loves it, although I bought it on a whim from eBay. https://reddit.com/r/typewriters/comments/kzfnvn/my_new_to_me_1947_i_think_smithcorona_silent_4s/|Excellent machine. Very sturdy, reliable, and great to type on. Wartime model, 1940s, serial number would tell you more and that's located on the right side of the frame under the ribbon cover. Very common, I have a beater sitting on a shelf waiting to be serviced and sold. Great first typewriter! Hanks likes these too I hear.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nNeed to get on that typewriterdatabase internet thing, it would appear. Thank you! Good luck in your ongoing endeavors!|Ted munk's site, excellent resource\nAre you hiring?|Hahahahaha maybe one day. I don't make enough to pay a fair wage and I don't have a brick and mortar yet. One day I will though, I'm not a socialite and I'd need help with the customer side of things, not to mention some bits of the servicing.\n&amp;#x200B;|I'm a believer in paying livable wages, yes I'd pay 15$ an hour and not a dot under, even if it meant I had to pay myself that much too! One day I will, but not today. Or tomorrow. Or for a while actually. Local rent is 3k a month!\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nWhen is the last time you increased rates? $45/hr for a niche specialty, in a city, is way too low.|Earlier this year! I'm always afraid of driving people away because I'm too expensive. But thanks for the sentiment! You're one of god knows how many now who think I should up things.\nDo you make any scratch in the area of Hollywood prop rentals and consulting? Up until a few years ago, there was a typewriter repair shop in my area that always felt like \"how is *that* place still in business?\" and as far as I understood, the fellow got by in part because occasionally, for a big-budget, super-serious movie, instead of any random old-time, clackety-clack typewriter, they could go to him and be like \"we need a period-accurate typewriter that a Des Moines newspaperman would be using in 1939\" and he'd hook 'em up for the Spielberg bucks.|No, I'm in an odd place to do that, but I know of people who do! I feel like in some areas they aren't quite as accurate, but at the end of the day few people notice. If someone ever hits me up, I'm game. Typewriters rule!\n^(the below has been split into two)|​&amp;#x200B;\nIf you had to change careers right now what would you switch to?|I'd probably go into welding. I'm good at it, and it makes money. I'd need to go get a certificate though. Fun stuff. Honestly people tell me I'm capable of more, but I enjoyed it. I'd rather do that than some sucky corporate job.\nA lot of people have idols or heroes they look up to. Who is yours?|Ah, and the second part of your question, yes and no. Not for typewriters, I had people I admired early on, like charlie from typewriter justice and duane from Phoenix typewriter. Great people, super kind.\n&amp;#x200B;|I also looked up to Grant Imahara from mythbusters. I was always extremely self conscious about being asian when I was younger, and Grant was one of the first people I ever saw that I thought was cool, and made me feel better about myself. I'd say the same about markiplier and Eugene from the try guys. I thought they were cool people, not because they were Asian. Learning they were both also Korean helped me a lot during highschool. I'm now watching Kim's conscience on Netflix, and I can enjoy it without feeling uncomfortable.\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\n'capable of more' sounds like you can really do anything you put your mind to. That's something to be very proud of :) Thanks for the consistently fantastic answers! I hope your weekend is going great.|Thanks for the questions!!\nI’m so glad I found you. I have an Olivetti mechanical with electric assist that uses ball technology similar to the IBM Selectric. It dates to the mid 70s and I’ve been told it’s the only machine of its type that can use plastic one-use ribbon and cloth reusable ribbon. My dream is to get her running smoothly again as I love the feel of her action. Have you worked on any Olivetti’s?|I have! They can be tricky, the Olivetti ball system is a little more scarce. I haven't seen ribbons around lately, but I'm sure the old cartridges can be refilled\nKnow anything about the Facit T2? I recently received one from a relative and did some minor repairs on it. Pretty fun to work on and type on, but the only think I know about it is that it was made in the 60s and is Swedish.|Not particularly. Facits are excellent machines, and the favorites of a few of my colleague buddies! Particularly Jack from Tampa Typewriter who would talk your ear off about the facit. The swedes made good typers!\n^(the below is a reply to the above)|​&amp;#x200B;\nConsidering it had been sitting in a basement for decades and all I had to do was tighten and lube the levers that cause the gears in the escapement to move (sorry, I know 0 technical terms), I'd say it's a pretty well-made machine.

Do you understand his point of view?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;HELL YES. Your father knew how to WRITE. The Executives were amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing typewriters because they supported PROPORTIONAL LETTER SPACING!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I get shivers just thinking about that. Their only drawback was the inability to swap typefaces, but other then that, the print and text is BEAUTIFUL. Especially some of the lesser available typefaces (the names of which currently elude me). Amazing, and considerably reliable. Also easier to service, as they were more traditional typewriters with typebars and not the Selectric Golf Ball Element.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I understood none of this, but the sheer joy and passion of it made me feel happy.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Hahahahaha yes, I am a nerd. Most typewriters are monospaced, meaning each character occupies the same amount of space. A period and the M would both be spaced the same. Proportional spacing is what you&amp;#39;re reading right now. The period takes up much less space than the M. The Executive is one of only three (i believe) proportional typewriters. It had six escapement, with the smallest character occupying two units, and the largest occupying around 5. Made for some lovely typography.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;[removed]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I haven&amp;#39;t been able to acquire one yet, but just looking at the work they make makes my mouth water.

The real mechanical marvels were the typesetting machines. Unfortunately, getting a working Linotype or Monotype may be a bit excessive, and then there&amp;#39;s the lead poisoning to worry about...&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The Linotype machines always amazed me. Most of them got destroyed with the advent of computer typesetting in the 80s. Just heard of a guy who got two of them! Truly wonderful machines...the Verityper was also a magnificent beast, called a cold typesetting machine. It was a typewriter which later had proportional, but also allowed you to switch through multiple typefaces with a dial, based on the brilliant Hammond Typewriter that was invented in 1888. James Hammond was the man!!!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I saw a Linotype in action at a print museum (Museu Nacional da Imprensa) in Porto (Portugal) - they had everything working, apart from the lead casting (for health and safety reasons). It was an astounding sight, and I spent well over an hour admiring and studying the contraption.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Shame, they could have cast tin!!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the second answer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Was there letter specific kerning? Like did a W followed by a d have the d closer to the W than another W because of the space under the angle?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;every character was assigned a specific amount of subspaces so that they would be even with the neighboring letters on other sides. Other then that, I&amp;#39;m not sure what you are asking&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the original answer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I thought the Selectrics also supported proportional letter spacing. I took typing in junior high on a Selectric and I must not have noticed.... I think what it really came down to was he wanted to feel himself hitting the paper one letter at a time. The Selectrics don&amp;#39;t give you that satisfaction, even though they&amp;#39;re faster. He was old enough he started his career on a manual....he ended up giving that machine to me as a toy when I was a kid. You really, really had to punch it. Wish I could remember the model- all I remember is the color, turquoise blue. He replaced the Executive with a Leading Edge word processor in 1986 and wrote 15 more books on PCs, but I&amp;#39;ll always remember him in front of a typewriter. Thanks for responding!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;No problem, thank you so much for sharing! I love hearing about peoples experiences with these machines. Honestly you have to type pretty damn fast to notice a speed difference. Even the selectric may not be the fastest. The Praxis is damn fast. I peak at 153wpm. On a manual typewriter its about 120. There certainly is a detriment with the higher key travel, but some people could pound along on manuals at close to 200. Mindblowing.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Dad and I were both north of 110 wpm, pretty sure he was around 130-135. Fast enough to notice the lag.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The lag is mostly in the return I feel. The selectric takes its time. That&amp;#39;s where the Praxis shines, it returns fast!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;That&amp;#39;s pretty fast!!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the 11th answer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Here I thought I was fast because I peaked at 90 on a regular keyboard 😐&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Hey that&amp;#39;s pretty good!!! Average is 45&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the reply to the original answer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Not the selectric - it could only switch between 10 and 12 characters per inch - but IBM made an electronic golfball typesetter called the “Composer” that had a memory and proportional spacing. It would print in much higher quality than the standard golfball selectric.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;IBM experimented with a lot of magnetic memory systems and card readers. Like the memory writer. They had some cool stuff happening!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the original answer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Helvetica. My boss in 1972 ordered one with Hevetica since he hated the standard courier/times new roman font&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Helvetia is hard to come by on typewriters&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the original question&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Lol, my father was an IBM Selectric repairman. I don&amp;#39;t know how he felt about the model D, but I know that Selectrics broke often enough that he always had plenty of work. _________________ The price difference between the two was equivalent to around $1K today. Historians don&amp;#39;t make bank, so it seemed eccentric at the time. He used the crap out of it; no question he got his money&amp;#39;s worth.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I have people still pounding away on the selectric! Last one I serviced had gone 15 years since it was last checked.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Have you come across any mechanical DVORAK typewriters, and if so how often do you see them?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I have only seen one DVORAK typewriter, it was a custom mod by a talented IBM selectric tech. Otherwise, they are very rare. I have heard rumors of two manuals out in the wild, but QWERTY was the layout that took the Americas by storm. Keyboard layouts change by languages, and DVORAK was designed to work well with English as it&amp;#39;s based on key frequency percentages. It is a tricky modification to do, but not impossible!!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Groovy, I have been using DVORAK on my keyboard for years and was curious how possible it was to find a typewriter. Thank you for the info : D&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;No problem! Forewarning, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be a cheap conversion!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the reply to the original answer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Is Dvorak worth messing with if one never learned to type the &amp;quot;correct&amp;quot; way, i.e. just using 2-3 fingers on each hand? I can type fairly fast in my own style - I did Mavis Beacon and some other things through the years to try to re-train myself, but have never been able to un-learn my unique system.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be honest, there is no real speed difference between the two unless you are at world record speeds around 300wpm, where it would be too slow to move your fingers to another row to type a common letter. Most normal people can get along well on either layout, and will never ever notice a perceivable speed difference.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the reply to the reply to the original answer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I can&amp;#39;t think of a context other than competitive typing if that&amp;#39;s a thing, where typing any faster than the average typing speed of most office workers would give you any edge. __________________________ well you need to type pretty fast when for example writing down stuff that is said in court or sth. tho i think today they use some weird specialised keyboards that are very different looking from normal ones. also would be useful to type fast when you are in studies and taking notes of what is said.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The court machines are called stenographs, and they write in shorthand by allowing the user to press multiple paddles at the same time to generate entire words or phrases.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the reply to the reply to the original answer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;[deleted]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Ah those split ones, yes. Sometimes I will hit a right side key with my left hand! I could never&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the original answer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The only way to do DVORAK on a selectric would be to make a custom golf ball wouldn&amp;#39;t it?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Not at all. You&amp;#39;d need to understand how a selectric works. You can do DVORAK with standard balls. Each ball has rows and columns, and there is a rotate and tilt mechanism that indexes a letter. That is all controlled by the Wiffel Tree, a 6 bit binary to mechanical decoder. The keys themselves press down on a series of interposed rods which correspond to the yes no input of binary. It&amp;#39;s that input that drives the letters. The interposed rods run the entire length of the keyboard, so all one needs to do, is shuffle around the appropriate key latch leavers, and then swap the key caps. The A latch rod will always pull the interposers to correspond with the binary input for the letter a, regardless of its position on the keyboard. I will say that the key leavers are independent of the latch rods (I believe) so that should also allow you to move letters down rows as well.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Interesting - I knew the theory behind it, I assumed the key latch levers wouldn&amp;#39;t be interchangeable. I&amp;#39;m keeping my eye out to buy a selectric one day, not because I need one, but just because I want to take it apart. I&amp;#39;ve read they use a bunch of ball bearings as an interlock to block multiple keypresses at once which is pretty clever.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Yes! It is a very interesting machine.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the original question&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Usually (based on a sample of one) if you use dvorak you are already touchtyping so might as well get blank keys 😁&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;My laptop keyboard existed scrambled forever, I touch type, didn&amp;#39;t need the letters&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below has been split into two&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;What do you think about the LEGO typewriter?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The lego typewriter, boy. I blogged about that one in length, but in short I was very impressed. There were a few areas where I thought the design could have been better, but the overall mechanics (being lego) impressed me. Especially the escapement. A brilliant blend of technics and system that emulated some of the real life mechanical components of the typewriter! Overall aesthetics were cool too, reminded me a lot of some Depression era machines like the Royal Signet.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Any chance you get to work on an item from the Tom hanks collection?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Yes.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Any link to this blog I’m certain the group over at &lt;a href=\"/r/lego\"&gt;/r/lego&lt;/a&gt; would appreciate it&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Hey, will do!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Dude, this is so cool. My dad was a typewriter mechanic from like 1970-90. I wish he was still around, I know he’d have a ton to ask you about how things have changed in the biz. To my actual question: You mentioned the Model M is your daily driver when using a computer. Have you tried any of the newer mech switches and, if so, do you have any favourites that could compete with the buckling springs on the M?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I will follow up and say things have changed a lot in the biz! Especially from what I hear from older techs, and what I uncover from the archeology of sorts while working. Even older clients. The internet has been an amazing resource to buy, sell, connect, and find parts. There is a flip side, none of these things are made or done anymore, so parts and expertise is hard to come by. Things have gotten a lot more coveted, even in the past 5 years. Key ring remover pliers now fetch $300 apiece. Crazy.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I&amp;#39;m not a keyboard guy, I feel like I&amp;#39;m the wrong person to ask about this lol. I grew up on a cheap Dell keyboard, but I loved it. I wanted something that bridged typewriters more closely with computers. And it was hard to argue with the legacy of the M. With so many keyboards and switch types available, I&amp;#39;m sure there are others out there that I would like, but I feel like the buckling spring is the most tactile.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;The “springhook” was my favourite tool when I was a Customer Engineer in IBM Office Products group in 1977-1980...&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I use a snag fixer, but yes! Invaluable&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the original answer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Wow $300. My father was a CE. I have all sorts of odd specialty tools laying around. I also have an Executive typewriter that I think he restored. He was fixing typewriters when he first started with IBM in the late forties.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I know some old IBM guys who have the old tools. I have a pair of IBM pliers sitting around.

I&amp;#39;d still be using it but my latest rig doesn&amp;#39;t have a PS/2 port.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I had no idea dell made buckling springs!!!! The other reply yes, hit that up. I use a PS/2 to USB for my IBM and its fantastic. I can&amp;#39;t out type it! Can&amp;#39;t believe they got rid of a perfectly good connector. I don&amp;#39;t get it. The IBM personal system 2 was actually the second computer to feature the model m. Don&amp;#39;t recall the name of the first bit it&amp;#39;s lesser known. The predecessor to that board came out on the IBM 5150, a legend among computing, and had the Model F board. Really the best computer at the time, beating the Apple II and everyone else until Apple released the macintosh in 84.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I would imagine these days it&amp;#39;s a very specific profession, do you see a lot of business?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I do indeed! I am currently backlogged about six or seven machines. Just had a lady drop off two machines for repair this morning. A lot of writers, enthusiasts, etc use them. Not just collectors!!

How has it gotten to that condition though? Even if it doesn&amp;#39;t work you should get it looking ship shape, its a baller.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;It will live again, just let me at it lol&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Have you ever seen Fringe (sci-fi show)? There&amp;#39;s a typewriter repair shop that&amp;#39;s featured several times in the early seasons, along with an old typewriter with an offset Y. Watching that show, I always wondered if such shops still existed. And I&amp;#39;ll never forget the carriage return sound from all those Jr. High reports. I&amp;#39;m weirdly glad you do what you do!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;thanks man! I&amp;#39;m living the dream as long as it&amp;#39;ll carry me! I have not seen that show, but now I am interested.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Fringe is an awesome show. When I saw your AMA, I thought the same thing about the typewriter repair shop. Worth watching the show besides.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I gotta check it out!!! Wonder if it&amp;#39;s a real shop...maybe I know them....&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Yea, put the typewriter down and go binge Fringe. You will not regret it. Then find yourself an IBM Selectric 251&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;HA! thanks for the show rec!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;How curled is your mustache and how is it in Portlandia these days?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I&amp;#39;m 21, too young for a nice curly mustache!!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;How often does Tom Hanks call you?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Tom Hanks is a wonderful person :)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Don&amp;#39;t let any &lt;a href=\"https://eu.heraldtribune.com/story/opinion/2020/09/22/qanon-zany-rehashing-anti-semitic-lore-inspired-holocaust/5852008002/\"&gt;Qanon tell&lt;/a&gt; you otherwise.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Ouch, hope &lt;code&gt;u/kirtaner-420chan&lt;/code&gt; takes care of them!!!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;[deleted]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Probably just needs to be cleaned a little, then lubed. Check where the platen ratchets. That is likely the problem area. You could also have an issue with the repeat key sticking.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Any reason why you exclude the Corona 4 from your repair list?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;You NOTICED. That little ffff...... uuuu yeah. It&amp;#39;s a pos. Finicky, poor access for adjustments, weak components, foolhardy mechanisms, not to mention I got screwed out of a lot of money involving some of those when I first started out. I hate them, they hate me, end of story.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Haha, yeah I bought a while back and would love to get it in working order (&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/cpmYI\"&gt;pics&lt;/a&gt;) but it was beyond my non-existent skill level. I do have another model (I think it&amp;#39;s an underwood) in storage that I would like to get up and running as well. I&amp;#39;ll reach out once I can locate it!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;no thanks lol&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;[removed]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I listen to a lot of music, I love it.

I feel like his style has evolved greatly, which is a good thing, that&amp;#39;s growth, it just doesnt hit me like it used to!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Carrie and Lowell is his finest work in my opinion. It harkens back to his earlier stuff, but the musicianship and production are top tier. Also, yay typewriters! Thanks for the AMA.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I love that album as well, there are some tracks that I find really beautiful, like Beloved of John, and Blue bucket of gold (I think those are the names)? But for me, illinoise will always be the masterpiece.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I thought you might enjoy a typewriter story. My wife&amp;#39;s father worked for Smith-Corona. There was a bunch of abandoned parts in the warehouse, and he asked his supervisor if he was able to build typewriter from those parts, could he keep it. The supervisor agreed, thinking there was no way to make anything from that mishmash of parts. He did it! That was my wife&amp;#39;s high school graduation present, and she used it all through college. We still have it and it still works great. Personally, I grew up near Endicott (home of IBM) and learned to type on a Selectric. Keep up the good work. I&amp;#39;ll ask a question just so the mods don&amp;#39;t delete this: Do you need any specialized tools to be a typewriter technician?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I am absolutely in love with that story! Reminds me of that one Johnny Cash song where he builds a Cadillac by stealing the parts. Excellent story, cherish that machine!!! It is not an easy feat, that&amp;#39;s for sure, and takes a special kind of genius. As far as your question goes, yes and no. I cant seem to find specialized tools, i really just need those keytop removers, but nowadays they are $300 a pair. I did recently aid in the creation of a screwdriver set made by chapman to specifically work on typewriters. Excellent set, and a worthy project. A must have for any typewriter tech! Other than that, I have made do.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Well, since we’re telling our father’s typewriter stories… After the war, my father was temporarily assigned to repair IBM typewriters in huge typing pool for the Social Security Administration. The pool consisted of 150 IBM typewriters, 150 Remington and 150 Smith Corona. I imagine the noise was deafening. Each company had one repairman who spent the entire day roaming around fixing machines. The SSA would only hire typists who were war widows or the wives of disabled veterans.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Thanks for the story, that&amp;#39;s fascinating!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Do you use Interrobang at all ‽‽!!‽‽ or ¡¡¿¿??!! I always lose upside down interrobang.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I have not! But you can always type a ? and backspace with a ! over it. Or if you dont have !, type a period and backspace an apostrophe over it. For upside down, find a Hispanic typewriter.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I tried but they&amp;#39;re not aligned so it looked bad&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;varies by machine. You can hold the carriage release and line it up carefully yourself!!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/lY4tUgn\"&gt;http://imgur.com/gallery/lY4tUgn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;So clean, I&amp;#39;ll show you how mine fucks it up in an hour&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;LOL&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/xTyFp34\"&gt;https://imgur.com/a/xTyFp34&lt;/a&gt; The first one came out fine for some reason -- usually it&amp;#39;s like the second two, where there&amp;#39;s ghosting of the question mark (though when I looked it up to check that was the right term, it seems that might be my fault for typing wrong). I&amp;#39;ve got some gripes with the machine, I&amp;#39;ll send you in a PM for advice.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Yeah, no two typewriters are equal. I had a designated exclamation on mine so I kinda cheated. You don&amp;#39;t have to type the period since the dot is already there for the question mark&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Would it be worth shipping a 1950ish Royal to you for a repair?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;That is up to you. 1950? Sounds like an FP. An INCREDIBLY fine writing machine. You&amp;#39;d foot the bill both ways, plus the $20 deposit and the repair. One of the best royal standard typewriters ever made! I wrote with one for a few years, sold it sadly last week.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;What’s a typewriter?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Isn&amp;#39;t that the million dollar question my man. A typewriter, well, its...how do I put this.. a machine that writes, by typing.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;But in all seriousness, it&amp;#39;s a mechanical machine that is designed to print letters in emulation of printed type by allowing a user to input specific characters. There&amp;#39;s too many different types to really group a definition, so it really truly is a machine that writes by typing, where type is what we consider to be a solid impressionable character that delivers ink to a medium in the shape of a legible character.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;So... like a computer?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Yes, and also no. Typewriters are single purpose, and manual typewriters dont need electricity. They are mechanical and operate solely by human input.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the original answer&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Can I play games on it?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Yes! Tic tac toe, hangman, uh.... you can have contests to see how far you can throw them.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Then I call you, right? This man’s a genius!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Yep!!! I tell all the new owners to throw them lol. The hustle is real!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the original question&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;A reverse iPad&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;this guy^&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;You mentioned youre using a vintage keyboard to type this, are you into mechanical keyboards or would you say you’re particular about the kind of keystrokes you like the most, be it typewriter or modern keyboard?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I am very fickle about the feel of my keyboards. I got the IBM because I wanted a nice tactile feel. I HATE those flat laptop pos&amp;#39;s. As far as typewriters go, I hates silents. While I like the lower noise, the silencer mechanisms all rely on a deceleration mechanism that I feel negatively impacts the feel. I like a smooth action, a sharp strike, and a quick rebound. 1930s Royal Portables are great, and I LOVE the Olympia SM3.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;You need to join us in the madness over at &lt;a href=\"/r/mechanicalkeyboards\"&gt;r/mechanicalkeyboards&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Oh no....I&amp;#39;m not sure lol&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;What&amp;#39;s your preferred method of dealing with an old, hardened platen? Chicago here too, btw. I&amp;#39;ve got an Olivetti Lettera 32 and a Royal O Portable.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;There is no good way to &amp;quot;rejuvenate&amp;quot; rubber. It is a material that constantly degrades. I replace the rubber via J.J. Short. Generally if it is in good shape and feeds paper well, I leave it alone. It is not something that is always necessary&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the original question&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;This. I have a Hermes Baby with a hardened platen and would love to restore.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Not hard to work on at all! Send the platen off for best results. I would not recomend turbo platen. Right now JJ short is really the only place.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the reply to the original question&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;is thata a Hermes......Baby!!! a Hermes model Baby or a model Hermes Baby?? _________________ &lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/C1JmyM6Tf5g\"&gt;This model&lt;/a&gt;. The Hermes Rocket was a name for a nearly (possibly completely) identical model.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I will confirm that they are completely identical.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is another reply to the original question&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;What sort of problems does hardened platen cause?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;They will either not feed the paper well, rarely damage the ribbon or wear on the type, or simply crack and fall apart. The type is hardened steel so I wouldn&amp;#39;t worry about that, but it can cut holes in your ribbon or even the paper.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;What is your favorite typewriter and why do you like it best?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Well, I have become the leading expert in the Williams typewriter co.

Good going. Prior to Typewriters what sorts of thing interested you ? Was there another topic you got heavily entrenched in ?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Oh god lol. I was OBSESSED with the ocean. Oceanography, marine biology, even shipbuilding. This was all before the age of 10. No sports or video games for me. Only fish. I consumed every YouTube video, book, and documentary. I watched finding Nemo so many times the VHS tape corrupted. It was my dream to become a marine biologist, I loved everything about it. I also had no friends, I mean, no kindergarteners were interested in sea surface currents and migration patterns, or the food sources for chemosythesizing organisms populating the hydrothermal vents. I looked up to Robert Ballard too! The guy who found the titanic (another obsession) For about 12-13 years I kept both freshwater and saltwater tanks. I sold my tank this summer, sad moment, I miss keeping fish considerably. But you know, dreams die out. I also wanted to be an artist but I don&amp;#39;t think I have what it takes! I also had a long invested interest in photography! I love film photography :)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;This is the best response so far, IMO. I respect OP&amp;#39;s current love for all things typewriter, but this one hit me hardest. I think most of us had obsessions when we were young. Myself, I wanted desperately to be an astronaut. (I am not an astronaut today.) It&amp;#39;s great to see someone in love with their current pursuit and simultaneously acknowledging they grew up loving something else.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Hey thanks for that! And ya know, I still love fish. I&amp;#39;m not going to be a biologist by any stretch, but I&amp;#39;ll never stop loving the ocean. Getting rid of that tank wasn&amp;#39;t easy. I&amp;#39;m still passionate about it, but just not in a way I can pursue.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;You could have a Viking funeral for typewriters you hate — and thus two world collide.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Yes, I will do such for the royal classic of 2020&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;You need to get in touch with &lt;code&gt;u/jamescookartwork&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ocuzhs/i_make_drawings_using_the_letters_and_numbers/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ocuzhs/i_make_drawings_using_the_letters_and_numbers/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I am familiar with him, as well as multiple other type artists!

I toyed around with the idea of a single element so one could swap type. It would also be portable, I love the Williams design. A non rotary escapement would be fun, glass keytops obviously, maybe octogon, maybe square, a polished metal body with leather accents.... something that looks modern, but is well machined. Who knows?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Is 3D printing useful for replacement parts for vintage typewriters?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Yes, some people use rubberized mediums for feet! A buddy of mine, Steve dade, made the best rubber feet in the business. He passed away recently so a lot of folks are turning to printing. I&amp;#39;ve also used it to replace a lot of platen knobs.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Sorry about your friend.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Thanks, he will be missed&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Interesting. I was a IBM OPCE (Office Products Customer Engineer) in the late Seventies but switched to repairing electronic devices (terminals, printers, PCs). It was only after I stopped repairing mechanical typewriters that I realised that the mechanical devices had one major advantage over electronic devices; you could see for the most part what was wrong. Even adjustment and repairs were easier. Are parts still available for the IBM golfball typewriters?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Parts are available! I have a fair bit, and you can still find NOS if you know where to look. I even have a can of the original Topaz Bronze touchup paint! Usually parts machines are the source nowadays.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Noticed the medium format film border. What’re you shooting with?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Sharp eye! Portra 400 on my Hasselblad 500c. I since sold that camera and got a CM, but miss my C.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;What are some good sources to purchase vintage typewriters?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Anyone reputable. I mean, me lol. I can also recomend Gramercy, Berkeley, Messa, and Cambridge typewriter to support brick and mortar. Also Tampa, Nashville, And Stephentown typewriter. There&amp;#39;s typewritermuse in LA, Phoenix typewriter, typewriter justice, unplug typewriter co...and a few others I might be forgetting. For canada check out Yeg typewriters. Mexico and spain there is ElGranero typewriter, Mr. And Mrs. Vintage for the UK, northern Europe, and Australia. Also Charlie foxtrot. I&amp;#39;m sure I&amp;#39;m missing some but I know all these guys and they&amp;#39;re legit!! Ken from california California typewriter (the tom hanks doc) works at Berkeley now. Stay away from Colombo collection for one. She does bad work, unreliable, overpriced, and rips off good techs like me. Jon posey is a pedophile stay away, but he doesnt sell much. Uhhhh on other guy who was a weasel, typewriter collection or something. Eh, cant avoid them all!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;[deleted]&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;It&amp;#39;s not publicized. And frankly I&amp;#39;m trying to stay out of the middle of it. Just the things he did to me personally, and to others I know including a minor who had it the worst. Some people are just a little fucked up.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;As far as photography, I love my hasselblad, I process 120 and 135 at home. Both black and white and C41. I also have an enlarger where I make black and white prints, but have yet to dive into RA4 color printing.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;What kinds of people make up your customer base?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Oh boy. Small office workers, authors, poets, artists, business owners, collectors, and anyone who needs or uses typewriters. Even inmates.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I&amp;#39;m a little older than you. My first job (in the &amp;#39;50s) was typing envelopes for advert mailers on a &lt;a href=\"https://img1.etsystatic.com/000/0/5340102/il_fullxfull.310016341.jpg\"&gt;1930&amp;#39;s Underwood exactly like this&lt;/a&gt;. I really loved that machine, bitch though it was. I think it weighed more than I did. Is there any chance I could find one today and buy it? I&amp;#39;m sure it would cost much more than the original!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Underwood 5, I have had many. You can find them all over, the most mass produced typewriter in the states basically. They made millions! They can be had anywhere from $5 to $500, though I wouldn&amp;#39;t pay more than 300 for one in superb shape, and 500 max for absolutely beyond mint. $150 is a fair price to pay for working, and I&amp;#39;d charge about $200 for one I&amp;#39;ve serviced. I am currently repairing one for a client who does sales. Check out the Vintage Mancave on etsy, he may be selling one, and I may have worked on it.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;In your opinion is there likely to be a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; new typewriter ever brought to market? Not like the plastic thing at Michaels&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;No, not at all. And its complicated why. Royal released that Michaels one as the Royal Classic. I&amp;#39;ve used it, it sucks. The epoch is bad too. Back in the day, a good mid sized typewriter like the 1960s Remington Quiet-Riter cost an equivalent 1600$ in today&amp;#39;s money. It was solid steel. The Royal Classic retails at around $200. There is no possible way a company can make money on a high quality machine, they simply cost way more to make than people these days are willing to pay. They were the laptops of the era, in price too. Back when the typewriter was the only method of print writing available, the price was justified much like it is for a computer today. All that manufacturing now has to be packed in as cheaply as possible to retail at a fraction of the price in a market that already has plenty of amazing machines.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;In short, it isnt going to happen on a commercial scale. I myself have thrown around designs and concepts for a new machine, but they would all need to be hand made, and the price would be outrageous.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Can you tell me more about this typewriter that I bought for my daughter? She loves it, although I bought it on a whim from eBay. &lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/typewriters/comments/kzfnvn/my_new_to_me_1947_i_think_smithcorona_silent_4s/\"&gt;https://reddit.com/r/typewriters/comments/kzfnvn/my_new_to_me_1947_i_think_smithcorona_silent_4s/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Excellent machine. Very sturdy, reliable, and great to type on. Wartime model, 1940s, serial number would tell you more and that&amp;#39;s located on the right side of the frame under the ribbon cover. Very common, I have a beater sitting on a shelf waiting to be serviced and sold. Great first typewriter! Hanks likes these too I hear.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Need to get on that typewriterdatabase internet thing, it would appear.

I&amp;#39;m always afraid of driving people away because I&amp;#39;m too expensive. But thanks for the sentiment! You&amp;#39;re one of god knows how many now who think I should up things.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Do you make any scratch in the area of Hollywood prop rentals and consulting? Up until a few years ago, there was a typewriter repair shop in my area that always felt like &amp;quot;how is &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; place still in business?&amp;quot; and as far as I understood, the fellow got by in part because occasionally, for a big-budget, super-serious movie, instead of any random old-time, clackety-clack typewriter, they could go to him and be like &amp;quot;we need a period-accurate typewriter that a Des Moines newspaperman would be using in 1939&amp;quot; and he&amp;#39;d hook &amp;#39;em up for the Spielberg bucks.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;No, I&amp;#39;m in an odd place to do that, but I know of people who do! I feel like in some areas they aren&amp;#39;t quite as accurate, but at the end of the day few people notice. If someone ever hits me up, I&amp;#39;m game. Typewriters rule!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below has been split into two&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;If you had to change careers right now what would you switch to?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I&amp;#39;d probably go into welding. I&amp;#39;m good at it, and it makes money. I&amp;#39;d need to go get a certificate though. Fun stuff. Honestly people tell me I&amp;#39;m capable of more, but I enjoyed it. I&amp;#39;d rather do that than some sucky corporate job.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;A lot of people have idols or heroes they look up to. Who is yours?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Ah, and the second part of your question, yes and no. Not for typewriters, I had people I admired early on, like charlie from typewriter justice and duane from Phoenix typewriter. Great people, super kind.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I also looked up to Grant Imahara from mythbusters. I was always extremely self conscious about being asian when I was younger, and Grant was one of the first people I ever saw that I thought was cool, and made me feel better about myself. I&amp;#39;d say the same about markiplier and Eugene from the try guys. I thought they were cool people, not because they were Asian. Learning they were both also Korean helped me a lot during highschool. I&amp;#39;m now watching Kim&amp;#39;s conscience on Netflix, and I can enjoy it without feeling uncomfortable.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&amp;#39;capable of more&amp;#39; sounds like you can really do anything you put your mind to. That&amp;#39;s something to be very proud of :) Thanks for the consistently fantastic answers! I hope your weekend is going great.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Thanks for the questions!!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I’m so glad I found you. I have an Olivetti mechanical with electric assist that uses ball technology similar to the IBM Selectric. It dates to the mid 70s and I’ve been told it’s the only machine of its type that can use plastic one-use ribbon and cloth reusable ribbon. My dream is to get her running smoothly again as I love the feel of her action. Have you worked on any Olivetti’s?&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I have! They can be tricky, the Olivetti ball system is a little more scarce. I haven&amp;#39;t seen ribbons around lately, but I&amp;#39;m sure the old cartridges can be refilled&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Know anything about the Facit T2? I recently received one from a relative and did some minor repairs on it. Pretty fun to work on and type on, but the only think I know about it is that it was made in the 60s and is Swedish.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Not particularly. Facits are excellent machines, and the favorites of a few of my colleague buddies! Particularly Jack from Tampa Typewriter who would talk your ear off about the facit. The swedes made good typers!&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;the below is a reply to the above&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;​&amp;#x200B;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Considering it had been sitting in a basement for decades and all I had to do was tighten and lube the levers that cause the gears in the escapement to move (sorry, I know 0 technical terms), I&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s a pretty well-made machine. I saw that you shoot film, too. We have a lot in common.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;As nerds often do....&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The TL;DR of the disclo is basically this: “We’re always looking for new products/technologies that could help CNVRG, and the Starlink service is just one of many that we are currently looking at.” As suspected, they’re kicking tires.\r\n&gt;    - ***MB:*** *This story has received a TON of attention from all angles. Many are pumped to see legitimate satellite tech in the Philippines, considering the abysmal state of remote connectivity in our country at the moment. Many were tickled by the prospect of Meme God Elon Musk having some impact on a stock’s price on the PSE, like the shenanigans that we’ve all watched from afar with Tesla, GameStop, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin. Others were less lighthearted, and wondered whether the [originating Bilyonaryo article](https://bilyonaryo.com.ph/2021/02/13/super-fiber-friends-spacexs-elon-musk-ties-up-with-converges-dennis-anthony-uy-broadband-deal/) and the hype that it generated were not some form of market manipulation. Yes, CNVRG had a great day but it didn’t smash into any ceiling and it wasn’t even really the big story of the day. I think it’s right to have a questioning eye for anything that isn’t in a company’s disclosure history, but it’s also important to know that this story could have originated as a leak from anywhere in CNVRG’s professional chain (lawyers, accountants, bankers) or from a source on SpaceX’s side of the table. It’s also possible for Bilyo or any of the other news outlets to have simply pieced together enough tidbits to form a speculative story. The key here is that the market has a mechanism to deal with these situations, and that is disclosure through the EDGE system.

The TL;DR of the disclo is basically this: “We’re always looking for new products/technologies that could help CNVRG, and the Starlink service is just one of many that we are currently looking at.” As suspected, they’re kicking tires.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;MB:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;This story has received a TON of attention from all angles. Many are pumped to see legitimate satellite tech in the Philippines, considering the abysmal state of remote connectivity in our country at the moment. Many were tickled by the prospect of Meme God Elon Musk having some impact on a stock’s price on the PSE, like the shenanigans that we’ve all watched from afar with Tesla, GameStop, Bitcoin, and Dogecoin. Others were less lighthearted, and wondered whether the &lt;a href=\"https://bilyonaryo.com.ph/2021/02/13/super-fiber-friends-spacexs-elon-musk-ties-up-with-converges-dennis-anthony-uy-broadband-deal/\"&gt;originating Bilyonaryo article&lt;/a&gt; and the hype that it generated were not some form of market manipulation. Yes, CNVRG had a great day but it didn’t smash into any ceiling and it wasn’t even really the big story of the day. I think it’s right to have a questioning eye for anything that isn’t in a company’s disclosure history, but it’s also important to know that this story could have originated as a leak from anywhere in CNVRG’s professional chain (lawyers, accountants, bankers) or from a source on SpaceX’s side of the table. It’s also possible for Bilyo or any of the other news outlets to have simply pieced together enough tidbits to form a speculative story. The key here is that the market has a mechanism to deal with these situations, and that is disclosure through the EDGE system. Before the markets opened, CNVRG disclosed basically that they’ve been talking to SpaceX and a number of other companies, but that nothing is certain enough to make a material disclosure.

(OTC: VNUE) announced today that it has  signed a radio monitoring and partnership agreement utilizing its  patent-pending Soundstr technology, with NEWHD Media, and additionally,  it was announced that VNUE CEO Zach Bair has joined NEWHD's Advisory Board.  He will join other notable figures on the NEWHD Advisory Board, including Tiki Barber, the former New York Giants star, and Paul Rodgers, lead vocalist of multi-platinum rock band Bad Company.\n\nThe deal will empower NEWHD to utilize the platform to provide  accurate music play reporting to reduce licensing costs to NEWHD's radio  stations, and also to increase transparency to all stakeholders.  NEWHD  and VNUE are also actively exploring other ways the two companies can  work together to create a better musical experience.\n\nVNUE's Soundstr is an innovative hardware and cloud computing  solution that will not only help bars, restaurants and venues to reduce  licensing costs, but also radio stations, many of whom pay far more than  their fair share for blanket music licenses, and importantly, will help  get the proper songwriters paid.\n\nNEWHD, founded by longtime rock radio personality Zach Martin,  is the \"playground for your favorite artists, streaming the best mix of  current and classic rock.\"  NEWHD maintains viable relationships with  many of the world's greatest talent, including the Beatles, Pink Floyd,  The Rolling Stones, and many of today's artists on major and independent  labels.\n\n\"Working with VNUE and the company's Soundstr technology will greatly  improve the efficiency and cost of tracking and reporting music that is  streamed through our stations,\" said Zach Martin.   \"Furthermore, I am personally very interested in making sure that the  correct artists and writers are paid for their hard work.  VNUE is a  very artist-friendly company, and I am happy for NEWHD to align with  their cause.\"\n\n\"Streaming radio stations have the same, if not more, hurdles that terrestrial radio have,\" said Zach Bair.   \"The technology components can be numerous and quite challenging, and  by leveraging Soundstr, we can create a much more streamlined process,  which we believe will result in lower costs to the stations, as well as  much less 'muss and fuss' when it comes to the licensing requirements  and reporting.\"\n\nFor more information about the Soundstr technology, visit [www.soundstr.com](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3037800-1&amp;h=4093596616&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundstr.com%2F&amp;a=www.soundstr.com).\n\n**About NEWHD Radio (**[**www.newhdmedia.com**](https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3037800-1&amp;h=2201199344&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newhdmedia.com%2F&amp;a=www.newhdmedia.com)**)**NEWHD Radio is the innovative radio platform founded by longtime rock radio jock Zach Martin.   NEWHD's vision is to provide exciting and innovative programming to a  worldwide audience using emerging radio technology, while taking  advantage of low-cost lease HD signals in major markets.  NEWHD  currently operates NEWHD Radio, and NEWHD LA Radio, with a goal of  adding additional stations in New York City, Las Vegas, Tennessee, and various other top 25 markets.  Founder Zach Martin is a direct descendant of Zachary Taylor, the 12th president of the United States.  He has been a fixture in New York radio for over three decades.  He worked with legendary radio personality Scott Muni for almost a decade, and has interviewed \"rock royalty\" ranging from Robert Plant and Ringo Starr  to, in his words, \"a whole bunch of country artists.\"  NEWHD,  championed by Martin, also provides unique opportunities for people in  the spectrum (autism), giving people a chance to contribute and be part  of something special.\n\n**About VNUE, Inc.

Allow me to offer this metaphor... Currently, when it comes to collecting data with regards to how many \"spins\" a song gets at a radio station or is played at other venues, the data is reviewed with the accuracy of a dirty magnifying glass from a child's detective play kit. Soundstr will provide the resolution of an electron microscope. See, it's not only the data but the accuracy and reliability of the data collected due to the fact there is a physical interface in-between is what makes VNUE so incredibly valuable.\n\nFood for thought... when it came to Facebook, what made them so valuable is the data they are able to collect.\n\n**Catalysts upcoming:**\n\nThey are about to launch their first 450 Soundstr units which are already in hand at their warehouse.\n\nThey are about to announce they have completed their next fund raising round to take the business to the next level ($3MM - $5MM), build more Soundstr units and....\n\nThey are about to complete a **share buyback** with the funds raised.\n\n**My opinions:**\n\nI believe this stock should already be trading between .03 - .05 today so it is really at a discount right now and that's before today's news. There are companies on the OTC which have far less going for them, have debt, etc. etc. and they are trading for 20X as much. Here is a clean company with no debt and the right technology with everything going for them. Do some research and get on board if you understand the opporunity.\n\nThis stock WILL have its run from pennies to $'s... it's just a matter of how long it takes for the market to realize what we have on our hands here.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Adding some videos of CEO Zach Bair discussing VNUE and their plans. \n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtCIpW9Ptx4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtCIpW9Ptx4)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGsXQjCV\\_9Y&amp;t=18s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGsXQjCV_9Y&amp;t=18s)\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQff3kWR0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQff3kWR0w)",

(OTC: VNUE) announced today that it has  signed a radio monitoring and partnership agreement utilizing its  patent-pending Soundstr technology, with NEWHD Media, and additionally,  it was announced that VNUE CEO Zach Bair has joined NEWHD&amp;#39;s Advisory Board.  He will join other notable figures on the NEWHD Advisory Board, including Tiki Barber, the former New York Giants star, and Paul Rodgers, lead vocalist of multi-platinum rock band Bad Company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The deal will empower NEWHD to utilize the platform to provide  accurate music play reporting to reduce licensing costs to NEWHD&amp;#39;s radio  stations, and also to increase transparency to all stakeholders.  NEWHD  and VNUE are also actively exploring other ways the two companies can  work together to create a better musical experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;VNUE&amp;#39;s Soundstr is an innovative hardware and cloud computing  solution that will not only help bars, restaurants and venues to reduce  licensing costs, but also radio stations, many of whom pay far more than  their fair share for blanket music licenses, and importantly, will help  get the proper songwriters paid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;NEWHD, founded by longtime rock radio personality Zach Martin,  is the &amp;quot;playground for your favorite artists, streaming the best mix of  current and classic rock.&amp;quot;  NEWHD maintains viable relationships with  many of the world&amp;#39;s greatest talent, including the Beatles, Pink Floyd,  The Rolling Stones, and many of today&amp;#39;s artists on major and independent  labels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Working with VNUE and the company&amp;#39;s Soundstr technology will greatly  improve the efficiency and cost of tracking and reporting music that is  streamed through our stations,&amp;quot; said Zach Martin.   &amp;quot;Furthermore, I am personally very interested in making sure that the  correct artists and writers are paid for their hard work.  VNUE is a  very artist-friendly company, and I am happy for NEWHD to align with  their cause.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Streaming radio stations have the same, if not more, hurdles that terrestrial radio have,&amp;quot; said Zach Bair.   &amp;quot;The technology components can be numerous and quite challenging, and  by leveraging Soundstr, we can create a much more streamlined process,  which we believe will result in lower costs to the stations, as well as  much less &amp;#39;muss and fuss&amp;#39; when it comes to the licensing requirements  and reporting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more information about the Soundstr technology, visit &lt;a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;o=3037800-1&amp;amp;h=4093596616&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.soundstr.com%2F&amp;amp;a=www.soundstr.com\"&gt;www.soundstr.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About NEWHD Radio (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;amp;l=en&amp;amp;o=3037800-1&amp;amp;h=2201199344&amp;amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newhdmedia.com%2F&amp;amp;a=www.newhdmedia.com\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;www.newhdmedia.com&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;NEWHD Radio is the innovative radio platform founded by longtime rock radio jock Zach Martin.   NEWHD&amp;#39;s vision is to provide exciting and innovative programming to a  worldwide audience using emerging radio technology, while taking  advantage of low-cost lease HD signals in major markets.  NEWHD  currently operates NEWHD Radio, and NEWHD LA Radio, with a goal of  adding additional stations in New York City, Las Vegas, Tennessee, and various other top 25 markets.  Founder Zach Martin is a direct descendant of Zachary Taylor, the 12th president of the United States.  He has been a fixture in New York radio for over three decades.  He worked with legendary radio personality Scott Muni for almost a decade, and has interviewed &amp;quot;rock royalty&amp;quot; ranging from Robert Plant and Ringo Starr  to, in his words, &amp;quot;a whole bunch of country artists.&amp;quot;  NEWHD,  championed by Martin, also provides unique opportunities for people in  the spectrum (autism), giving people a chance to contribute and be part  of something special.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About VNUE, Inc.

Allow me to offer this metaphor... Currently, when it comes to collecting data with regards to how many &amp;quot;spins&amp;quot; a song gets at a radio station or is played at other venues, the data is reviewed with the accuracy of a dirty magnifying glass from a child&amp;#39;s detective play kit. Soundstr will provide the resolution of an electron microscope. See, it&amp;#39;s not only the data but the accuracy and reliability of the data collected due to the fact there is a physical interface in-between is what makes VNUE so incredibly valuable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Food for thought... when it came to Facebook, what made them so valuable is the data they are able to collect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalysts upcoming:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are about to launch their first 450 Soundstr units which are already in hand at their warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are about to announce they have completed their next fund raising round to take the business to the next level ($3MM - $5MM), build more Soundstr units and....&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are about to complete a &lt;strong&gt;share buyback&lt;/strong&gt; with the funds raised.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My opinions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe this stock should already be trading between .03 - .05 today so it is really at a discount right now and that&amp;#39;s before today&amp;#39;s news. There are companies on the OTC which have far less going for them, have debt, etc. etc. and they are trading for 20X as much. Here is a clean company with no debt and the right technology with everything going for them. Do some research and get on board if you understand the opporunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This stock WILL have its run from pennies to $&amp;#39;s... it&amp;#39;s just a matter of how long it takes for the market to realize what we have on our hands here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Adding some videos of CEO Zach Bair discussing VNUE and their plans. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtCIpW9Ptx4\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtCIpW9Ptx4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGsXQjCV_9Y&amp;amp;t=18s\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGsXQjCV_9Y&amp;amp;t=18s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQff3kWR0w\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaQff3kWR0w&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

At a family therapy session, Skyler tells Walt that she is concerned about his missing hours, but he explains that he just likes to be alone sometimes and take walks.\n\n - While cooking meth, Jesse observes a radiotherapy burn on Walt's chest and realizes he is trying to take care of his family before he dies of lung cancer. Jesse finishes their current batch and spends all night selling it, bringing Walt his share of $1,300, far less than he expected. Jesse explains they need a distributor if they want to make more money; after Krazy-8's death, Tuco Salamanca has taken over his territory. Jesse gains a meeting with Tuco after getting his friend Skinny Pete, who served time in prison alongside Tuco, to vouch for him. Though Tuco is willing to pay $35,000 for a pound of meth, he insists on paying only after his dealers have completed the sales. When Jesse refuses, Tuco severely beats him and lands him in the hospital.\n\n - Meanwhile, Hank traces the gas mask found in the desert to Walt's high school. Hank and Walt take inventory of the chemistry lab to find other equipment missing, leading Hank to suspect that a student obtained a key to the lab storage room. Later, Hank arrests a school janitor named Hugo, who would have had the keys and had a previous record for drug possession. Walt feels guilty letting Hugo take the fall and tries to contact Jesse, only to learn about his hospitalization. He visits Jesse and learns what happened with Tuco.\n\n - Now starting to lose his hair from the chemo, Walt decides to shave off what remaining hair he has left. Afterwards, he arranges for a meeting with Tuco under the name \"Heisenberg,\" demanding $50,000 from Tuco—$35,000 for the meth Tuco took from Jesse, and $15,000 for pain and suffering for Jesse's treatment. Seeing Walt with another bag of material, Tuco calls his bluff and threatens Walt. Walt throws a piece of the material against the floor which explodes. The entire floor is shaken, blowing out the windows and knocking everyone in the room off their feet. Walt reveals that the bag contains fulminated mercury. Walt threatens to smash the entire bag to the ground. Tuco submits and agrees to the payment as well as agreeing to a purchase for the next week, offering Walter $35,000 for the next pound of meth. Walt demands instead that Tuco buy two pounds of meth a week for $70,000. Tuco, incredulous, agrees. Walt leaves the building. Once back in his car, Walt exhibits an intense rush from what he has just done.\n\n- October 25-31, 2008: A No Rough Stuff Type Deal\n\n - At a high school PTA meeting, Walt fondles Skyler beneath the conference room table, arousing her. In the parking lot, the two of them have sex in the back of Walt's car – Walt is beginning to get off on the danger of his situation. Jesse, who is now living in the RV, puts his house on the market because he is too traumatized by the deaths of Krazy-8 and Emilio to continue living there. Walt tells him about the deal with Tuco, but Jesse says producing two pounds of meth a week is impossible. His \"smurfs\" – people who supply him the pseudoephedrine needed to cook the meth – can only supply so much a week.\n\n - Walt and Jesse meet Tuco and his men at a junkyard, where they hand him approximately half a pound of meth. Tuco is furious that Walt's end of the bargain was not kept and pays him only $17,000. He gives Walt another chance next week, but Walt says he still wants the $70,000 Tuco promised upfront, despite not having the goods. Tuco agrees to $52,500, which adds up to $65,625, but threatens dire consequences if next week's quota is not met. To make up for it, Walt promises to have four pounds of meth at the next meeting.\n\n - At Skyler's baby shower, Marie presents her with an expensive white gold baby's tiara. This seems to irritate Hank. In the yard, Walt and Hank have a philosophical conversation about the dividing line between legal and illegal behavior. That night, Walt tells Skyler that he is planning to spend a weekend at a holistic medical clinic after she expressed desire for alternative therapy. In reality, Walt is cooking meth with Jesse. Skyler goes to return the tiara and is detained in the store – it turns out that Marie stole it, but Skyler matches her description. She pretends to go into labor, persuading them to let her go. Skyler later confronts Marie about the theft, but Marie calmly denies it.\n\n - Walt has a plan to manufacture the meth using different precursors, and gives Jesse a list of chemicals and equipment to acquire with the cash fronted by Tuco. Jesse gets almost everything Walt requested except methylamine, which is kept tightly controlled. Jesse knows of a chemical warehouse where there are men willing to steal and sell the methylamine for $10,000. Walt decides they will steal the methylamine themselves by using the aluminum powder in Etch-a-Sketches to make thermite. At night, Walt and Jesse trespass into the warehouse, subdue a security guard by locking him in a portable toilet, and place the thermite on a locked door, which melts the metal when lit. The two steal a 40 gallon drum of methylamine and escape.\n\n - The next day, Walt and Jesse attempt to start the RV when mechanical troubles prevent it from going anywhere. Faced with a deadline, they set up to cook in Jesse's basement, unaware that his realtor has planned an open house viewing for that afternoon. Jesse guards the door to the basement while Walt synthesizes the chemicals, and once a man asks to see the basement, Jesse demands that everyone leave. When Walt arrives back home, he learns of Marie's theft and wonders if Skyler would ever turn him in for a crime. At the next meeting with Tuco, Walt supplies 4.6 pounds of meth. Despite its blue hue, it is still the same quality and Tuco hands over $91,000. When one of Tuco's men makes an offhanded remark to Walt, Tuco becomes furious and beats the man with his fists until he is unconscious. As Tuco drives away, Walt and Jesse look at each other in shock.\n\n- October 31 - November 7, 2008: Seven Thirty-Seven\n\n - In the junkyard, after his purchase of meth from Walter White and Jesse, drug kingpin Tuco Salamanca viciously assaults his lieutenant, No-Doze, after he speaks to Walt in Tuco’s place. After Tuco departs, Walt calculates the amount of money he will need to provide for his family, concluding that the figure is $737,000. Tuco suddenly returns demanding that Walt save an unresponsive No-Doze. After he dies, Gonzo, the other man in Tuco’s employ, states that they should move the body, but Tuco refuses and leaves it in the junkyard.\n\n - Walt parts ways with Jesse and goes home. Skyler White finds him standing at the television, and he subsequently forces himself on her. After she makes him stop, Walt sits by the pool and is later found by Walter Jr. Meanwhile, Jesse acquires a firearm at a hot dog restaurant. The next day, he tells Walt that he believes Tuco poses a threat that must be taken care of. Walt points out that shooting him would end badly, and the pair seems despondent. Elsewhere, Skyler refuses to answer phone calls from her sister, Marie Schrader. Marie and her husband Hank argue about whether or not she attempted to schedule a dinner with Skyler in a way that conflicts with another appointment that she has for therapy, revealing that Marie reluctantly goes to therapy for unspecified problems.\n\n - At the DEA field office, Hank's partner Steven Gomez shows him footage of Walt and Jesse's methylamine robbery. Hank dismisses their ability as thieves, but is intrigued by the fact that the unknown pair stole methylamine and used thermite to enter the warehouse. Gomez speculates they may be college-aged chemistry students, and Hank hints that the two will encounter difficulty from the drug cartels for disrupting the meth trade. Walt becomes worried when he notices an SUV parked near his house and spends the night watching the street. Jesse encourages Walt to also purchase a gun, hoping to \"double their chances\" of success in the event of a shooting. Instead, Walt proposes that they kill Tuco in a more clandestine way, using ricin made from castor beans. Hank visits Skyler and asks her to make up with Marie. Skyler responds angrily, stating that her situation is worse than her sister’s. Hank and Skyler both realize that the other knows about Marie's shoplifting.\n\n - Walt and Jesse produce the ricin, hoping to trick Tuco into poisoning himself by placing it in the next meth delivery. As they finish their work, Walt receives a phone call from Hank, who is at a crime scene. Hank says that he screwed up in speaking to Skyler, and Walt forgives him. It is revealed that the crime scene Hank is investigating is the junkyard, and that Gonzo has accidentally died in a botched attempt to move No-Doze's body. Walt and Jesse infer that Tuco killed Gonzo, and Walt insists that Jesse leave town. Walt returns home, where he avoids answering questions from Skyler. He receives a phone call and goes outside, where Jesse is being held at gunpoint in his car by Tuco. Tuco forces Walt to enter the car.\n\n- November 8, 2008: Grilled\n\n - Having been kidnapped by a crazed Tuco, Walt and Jesse are held prisoner in a desert hideout where he takes care of his sick uncle, the mute Hector Salamanca. Hector is incapacitated from the neck down and unable to speak, but can communicate with a desk bell attached to his wheelchair. Hank and the DEA have rounded up Tuco's entire organization, and Tuco thinks that one of his associates ratted him out. He intends to keep Walt and Jesse in the compound until his cousins take them all across the border to Mexico.\n\n - Hank, meanwhile, takes a bit of time off to look for Walt. Skyler is sick with worry and has been distributing handbills with Walt's photo. Hank remembers that Jesse was Walt's source of marijuana and tries to track him down. Walt tries unsuccessfully to poison a burrito Tuco prepares with the ricin he has prepared; Hector thwarts the attempt, prompting Tuco to lash out at Walt and Jesse. Tuco takes them outside and plans to kill them. Walt and Jesse manage to wound Tuco and escape. Hank shows up looking for Jesse, and is confronted by a wounded Tuco. A brief firefight ensues; Hank shoots and kills Tuco. \n\n- November 8-11, 2008: Bit by a Dead Bee\n\n - Having gotten away from Tuco, Walt and Jesse now have to get home and explain where they have been. Walt has a plan for both of them and they split up. Walt goes to a supermarket and takes off all of his clothes while walking around the aisles. He is hospitalized and claims to have no memory of where he has been for the last few days. The hospital is unable to find anything wrong with him, and Walt suggests that it was a combination of medication and chemotherapy that could have caused the episode. The hospital believes Walt is at risk for another fugue state and forces him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Walt admits to the psychiatrist after receiving assurances regarding patient confidentiality that he remembers everything and just wanted to get away for a while. They eventually agree to release him.\n\n - Jesse returns to his house to clean out the basement and get rid of the RV where he and Walt have been making methamphetamine. When the DEA agents track him down, he claims that he has been with a prostitute, Wendy, for the weekend. The DEA does not believe him and bring in Tuco's uncle Hector to identify him, but Hector refuses to cooperate with the authorities. They have to let Jesse go. Jesse tries to contact his parents, but they refuse to help him. That night, Walt convinces Jesse to continue cooking meth. Later, Hank gets a present at the station: Tuco's teeth grill encased in a clear acrylic cube.\n\n- November 12, 2008: Jimmy/Saul's 48th birthday\n\n- November 12-17, 2008: Down\n\n - Walt and Jesse meet at a gas station to discuss their next move. Walt says he needs time to reassure his family after his \"fugue state\" before he can cook again, and gives Jesse $600. The next morning, Walt cheerily makes breakfast, clearly disturbing Skyler and Walt Jr.; Skyler abruptly leaves the house and does not return until much later, not telling Walt where she has been. Meanwhile, Jesse meets with an attorney and his parents, who tell him that they found the meth lab in his basement and are evicting him from his aunt's house. They tell him he has 72 hours to leave, but the next morning Jesse's mother arrives with workmen who take everything in the house to storage. Jesse at first tries to convince his mother that he can change, then angrily tells her that he earned the house by taking care of his cancer-stricken aunt while his mother did nothing. She loses her temper and slaps him.\n\n - Hoping to reconnect with his son, Walt offers to give Walt Jr. a driving lesson while Skyler is out again. Walt Jr. shows his skill at driving, but Walt notices that he is using both feet to work the pedals. When Walt tries to get him to only use the right foot, Walt Jr. gets upset and accidentally hits a safety cone. Jesse searches for a place to stay, but all of his friends turn him away. While Jesse is making a call at the gas station, his motorcycle and all his remaining possessions are stolen. Dejected, Jesse breaks into the lot where his RV is being kept, but accidentally falls through a Port-a-Potty, drenching himself in waste. He sleeps in his RV, only able to breathe through a gas mask. The next morning, Clovis, the lot owner, finds him and demands the money he is owed, plus extra for repairs to the RV and the Port-a-Potty. Having no cash, Jesse begs for time to pay him back, but Clovis kicks him out and plans to sell his meth-cooking equipment. Jesse breaks back into the lot, steals his RV, and escapes by driving through the locked gate.\n\n - While Walt Jr. is at school, Walt tries to have a conversation with Skyler. He apologizes for how he has been acting lately, but Skyler is still convinced he is hiding something and storms out when he won't tell her what it is. Walt follows her out and sees the RV parked near his house. He confronts Jesse over making contact, and Jesse tells him he only wants his half of the money they've made and will disappear. Walt angrily states that he has done all the work while Jesse has done nothing, ranting that Jesse is a \"pathetic junkie\" who is too stupid to follow simple instructions. This causes Jesse to lose his temper and attack him, but he stops himself from beating Walt. Walt brings Jesse inside and gives him his half of the earnings, and then offers him breakfast. Meanwhile, back at the gas station, Skyler gets into her car and takes out a cigarette and lighter. She hesitates, thinking about her pregnancy, but starts smoking.\n\n- November 18-29, 2008: Breakage\n\n - Walt finishes his first round of chemotherapy and is told he will learn the results in two months' time, around when his baby is due. However, Walt begins to feel overwhelmed by the growing medical bills, and the money he made from Tuco is running out. While he is vomiting into the toilet, he finds something clogging it - the packet of cigarettes Skyler was smoking.\n\n - Jesse returns to Clovis to make good on his word: he pays for the towing and repair of his gate. He also works out a deal to store his RV in Clovis' lot, and buys a used car from him. Next, he rents an apartment from Jane Margolis, who manages the property and lives next door. Although he likes the space, he has no credit history and can only pay in cash. She initially refuses to rent to him, but eventually agrees after raising the price for cash only.\n\n - Hank is promoted to a high-ranking Albuquerque liaison for the DEA, and will have to split his time between the city and El Paso, Texas. He goes out to celebrate with his friends, but has a panic attack on the elevator ride down. The next day, he takes off work to bottle some of the beer he has brewed at home. Marie is confused at this behavior, but he assures her everything is all right. After she leaves, a bottle breaks during capping, cutting his hand.\n\n - Meanwhile, Walt and Jesse meet again to discuss how to distribute their meth. Jesse does not want to work on his own now that the DEA have found him, and suggests building a network of dealers so that they can be both distributors and producers. Walt is initially reluctant, but Jesse threatens to walk if they don't follow his plan. Later, Jesse invites his friends Combo, Skinny Pete, and Badger to his apartment, and discusses using them as dealers.\n\n - At a cookout celebrating Hank's promotion, Skyler demands that Marie apologize for giving Skyler the stolen tiara, or it will irreversibly drive a wedge between them; Marie tearfully does so.\n\n - Jesse's dealers are doing well selling their meth, until Skinny Pete is robbed by one of his customers. When Jesse gives Walt his share, minus the stolen money, he explains that it is breakage—revenue loss from damaged, lost, or stolen goods—that must be expected as the cost of doing business. Walt, however, worries what will happen when word gets out that they can be robbed with impunity. He later shows up at Jesse's apartment and gives him a gun, telling him to take care of the problem.\n\n - He also confronts Skyler over her smoking, but she refuses to apologize for keeping secrets when he has been doing the same. That night, Hank is woken by what he thinks are gunshots, and goes through the house with his pistol drawn. It turns out to be caps popping off beer bottles due to pressure. The next day, he drives down to the Rio Grande and throws his trophy of Tuco's grill into the river.\n\n- November 30, 2008: Peekaboo\n\n - Jesse gets the address of the couple who ripped off Skinny Pete and goes to their dilapidated house. Upon breaking inside, he finds and tends to their young neglected son. When the couple returns home, Jesse holds them up and demands that they return his meth and his money. They give him part of the meth, claiming to have lost the other portion, and show him an ATM they have stolen from a convenience store. The husband, Spooge, works unsuccessfully to open the ATM. While Jesse is busy playing with the son, the wife knocks him unconscious, stealing his gun and drugs. Jesse wakes up to see Spooge trying to open the ATM from the bottom. His wife, angry that he keeps calling her a \"skank\", knocks the ATM over, crushing him; she then takes his drugs and gets high on the couch. Jesse hurriedly takes back the gun, takes what money he can when the ATM pops open, and calls 9-1-1. He then brings the boy out of the house, tells him not to go back inside, and runs away.\n\n - On his first day back teaching after finishing chemotherapy, Walt teaches his class about Dr. Tracy Hall, the inventor of synthetic diamonds, who earned only a pittance for his invention while General Electric made an incalculable profit. At home, Skyler gets a call from Gretchen Schwartz, whom she still believes is paying Walt's medical bills. Skyler invites Gretchen over that afternoon, but Gretchen quickly leaves when Walt arrives home. Walt asks Gretchen if Skyler told her anything; she does not answer. Walt then drives up to Santa Fe to apologize to Gretchen for lying, but Gretchen demands to know why Walt did it and how he has been paying for his treatment. Walt, angry at being cut out of Gray Matter Technologies, denies her any right to that information; Gretchen insists that Walt was the one who left by walking out of their past relationship. Walt curses at her. When Walt gets back home, Skyler tells him that Gretchen called to say that the Schwartzes will no longer be paying for Walt's treatment. Realizing his cover has now been blown, Walt claims that the Schwartzes have gone broke, but promises that he and Skyler will be able to find the necessary money.\n\n- December 1-2, 2008: Negro y Azul\n\n - The episode opens with the narcocorrido band Los Cuates de Sinaloa performing \"Negro y Azul\" (\"Black and Blue\"), which is about how \"a gringo boss\" named Heisenberg is disrespecting the Mexican drug cartel by cornering the Albuquerque market with high-quality blue crystal methamphetamine.\n\n - Walt has trouble getting in touch with Jesse and goes to his apartment. Jesse has been staying inside and smoking marijuana since witnessing Spooge's murder. Walt is at first horrified that someone was murdered, but calms down upon learning that nobody can identify Jesse. A call comes in from Badger to set up a deal. Walt is forced to meet Jesse's dealers and learns they are now afraid of Jesse following a rumor that he killed Spooge. Walt uses Jesse's new underworld reputation to galvanize him into helping expand their operation.\n\n - Hank is having trouble fitting in at the DEA office in El Paso, Texas, where his sense of humor is not appreciated and his coworkers do not respect him, partly due to his lack of ability in speaking Spanish. At a meeting with a cartel informant nicknamed \"Tortuga\", Hank loses his patience at the man's demands and his apparent disrespect. Some days later, while waiting for a meeting in the desert, Hank spots a message from the cartels: Tortuga's severed head, mounted on top of a tortoise. Sickened by the grotesque display, Hank moves away from the tortoise. Doing so saves his life when a bomb strapped to the tortoise goes off, killing one agent and wounding three others.\n\n - Due to financial constraints, Skyler goes to her old company to apply for an entry-level job. She meets with her old friend and boss, Ted Beneke, who has taken over the company after his father's death. He decides to give Skyler her old job in the accounting department. Walt is concerned over Skyler's health at the workplace, especially since she originally left due to health problems from the company's manufacturing. There is an obvious sexual tension between Skyler and Beneke; he reveals that he recently separated from his wife, the mother of his two children.\n\n - Jesse sees his landlady, Jane Margolis, drawing on their front steps, and connects with her over their love of art. However, he is identified by a passing motorcyclist who has heard of his reputation, and it is revealed that he lied to her about his name. After he later admits to lying to her, she says that she doesn't care what he does as long as he doesn't do it at the house. He invites her inside to watch TV, even though he can't get his new television working. She holds his hand as they stare at the blank television.\n\n- December 3-5, 2008: Better Call Saul\n\n - After Badger is arrested in a sting operation by the Albuquerque Police, Walt and Jesse look into hiring a shady, flamboyant lawyer named Saul Goodman. Saul has already offered to be Badger's legal counsel and has found out that the DEA is hoping that Badger will lead them to \"Heisenberg.\" Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to flip to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from confessing, but Saul refuses.\n\n - Walt and Jesse resort to kidnapping Saul, threatening to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing on them. However, Saul sees through their scare tactics and instead asks for payment so he can legally represent them, and keep their talks confidential. Saul tells the duo about a man, Jimmy \"In-'N-Out\" Kilkelly, who makes a living being paid by other criminals to go to jail, and offers to have him stand in for Heisenberg. The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger gives them a fake deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school, telling him that he is too easy to find. Saul offers to be Walt's full-time legal counsel and adviser in covering his tracks.\n\n - Skyler goes to work on a Saturday, and Walt notices that she is dressing especially well for her job with Ted. Seeing that Hank has holed himself in his house, Walt gives him a motivational speech, talking about how he has not had any fear in his life since he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. This helps Hank leave the house, but he still has panic attacks. Meanwhile, Jesse has slept with Jane and learns she is in recovery from addiction. Later, after Jesse orders a mattress for his apartment, he and Jane have sex once again.\n\n- December 6-12, 2008: Four Days Out\n\n - Walt arrives at the hospital with his family for a CT scan to learn how he has reacted to chemotherapy. He is told that the results of the test will not be ready for a week, but sees a scan of his lungs and notices a prominent growth. Believing that he has little time left, and realizing that recent expenses and Saul Goodman's fees for laundering his money leave him with little to give his family, Walt decides to spend several days doing nothing but cooking meth. Walt makes up a story about visiting his mother for an extended weekend to be able to explain his absence to Skyler. He convinces Jesse to help for the weekend; Jesse is initially reluctant but cancels his plans to go on a date in Santa Fe with Jane when Walt claims they need to use as much of their supply of methylamine as possible before it goes bad.\n\n - After Jesse collects the additional supplies and picks Walter up from the airport, they drive the RV out to the desert to cook. Walt tells Jesse to leave the keys in a safe spot, and Jesse leaves them in the ignition switch, unaware that it is draining the vehicle's battery. After a few days of cooking, Walt estimates they have nearly $1.2 million in meth. With their portable generator out of gasoline, Walt wants to get more gasoline and get right back to work, but Jesse convinces him they should take a break to find a hotel for the night. When they go to start the RV, they find the battery dead. They attempt to siphon off gasoline from the RV to the generator to jump start the vehicle, but gas spilled in the process causes the generator to catch fire, and Jesse uses all of their drinking water to douse it.\n\n - Jesse suggests they call Skinny Pete for help using Walt's cell phone; despite knowing that Skyler will likely discover this in his cell phone records, Walt allows Jesse to make the call. Jesse tries to give directions to Skinny Pete, but they are unsure if he got them all. When Skinny Pete does not arrive, they call him again, and discover he is far off the directions before the phone dies.\n\n - Walter tears down the generator to allow him to try to trickle charge the RV's battery by manually turning the generator's crank. Though this briefly enables the engine to turn over, the battery quickly dies. Walt becomes depressed and starts suffering from heat exhaustion. Jesse realizes that Walt believes he is going to die, evidenced later when Walt coughs up blood. Walt believes he deserves to die as he has constantly lied to his family. Jesse tries to cheer Walt from his slump, and this inspires Walt to construct their own battery from the materials they have on hand. The makeshift battery provides enough power to jump-start the RV, and they are able to return to Albuquerque. \n\n - Walter and Jesse have breakfast, estimating they will make more than $1 million, Walter laments having waited his entire life to do something special and says Jesse is lucky because he will not have to wait. Jesse drops Walt at the airport, assuring Walt that if Walt dies, his family will get their share of the money.\n\n - Walt and his family return to the doctor the next week, and learn that Walt's cancer is in remission; the \"growth\" Walt spotted was simply inflamed tissue in his lung, and a resulting tear in his esophagus caused him to cough up blood, but will heal in time. Walt's family is ecstatic, but Walt, privately, has a violent outburst realizing that death will not put an end to his web of lies or his drug dealing.\n\n - Approximate: Methamphetamine manufacturer Gale Boetticher excitedly sets up equipment in an underground meth superlab for drug kingpin Gus Fring. Gale asks Gus about the blue meth being produced by chemist Walter White, who is not yet working for Gus. Gus explains he has reservations about hiring Walter, but Gale insists Gus hire him because of his superior product.\n\n- December 13-18, 2008: Over\n\n - Following his discovery that he is in remission, Walt takes Skyler's advice to take the week off from work, but secretly meets with Jesse. He tells Jesse the good news, and that he is out of the drug trade now that he no longer has to pay for treatment. During Skyler's party celebrating the remission, Walt pours Walt Jr. some tequila that he and Hank are drinking. After Walt keeps pouring, Hank takes the bottle away from him. Walt angrily demands it back, leading to a tense standoff which is broken as Walt Jr. vomits into the pool.\n\n - The next day, Skyler refuses to answer Walt's calls in which he tries to apologize. In order to distract himself, he goes on a home improvement spree, replacing their water heater. At work, Skyler confides in Ted about Walt's condition. When Ted notices that she is purposefully staying late, she breaks down, saying that she doesn't feel optimistic because she knows that Walt still has cancer. Ted understands, having suffered physically while caring for his dying father. They tenderly hold hands. The next day, as Ted is leaving, Skyler creates a distraction in order to spend more time with him.\n\n - At the hardware store, Walt notices the cart of a young man buying materials to make drugs. He offers advice about what ingredients to get, causing the man to run away. Outside in the parking lot, he sees the young man with his partner; Walt orders the two to stay out of his territory. Meanwhile, Jesse clumsily makes breakfast for Jane and tells her they can spend the day together. She admires his drawings of superheroes, which she points out all look like him. They hear knocking on Jane's door, which turns out to be her father, the owner of the property. When Jesse goes outside to speak with him, Jane acts like she does not know him. Later, she tells him she was protecting him from her overbearing father, but Jesse is upset that she does not take their relationship seriously. He smokes meth to comfort himself, but brightens when Jane slides a drawing under his door: a superhero called \"Apology Girl\" that looks like her.\n\n- December 19-27, 2008: Mandala\n\n - Combo is selling drugs on a corner when he notices two rival dealers staring him down; he is then killed by a young boy working for them. Skinny Pete, spooked by Combo’s death and Badger's recent brush with the law, decides to quit the drug trade. Walt and Jesse meet with Saul to discuss their next move; he tells them that they are incompetent distributors, and need a businessman who is more restrained than Tuco and will buy their product in bulk. He offers to reach out to the only distributor of that kind he has heard of, but it will be difficult, as the man is extremely cautious. Jesse is distraught that he got Combo killed, and that night tells Jane to leave his apartment so that he does not harm her recovery when he smokes meth. Jane reluctantly decides to stay with him.\n\n - The next day, Walt waits at a local chicken restaurant called Los Pollos Hermanos, where the distributor has arranged to meet them; Jesse comes in late, still high, and leaves quickly afterwards. Nobody talks to Walt, but he realizes later that the distributor saw him and has refused to work with him. Meanwhile, Jane relapses into drug addiction and introduces Jesse to heroin. The next day, Walt goes back to the same restaurant and waits until closing. He eventually realizes that the man he assumes is the restaurant manager is in fact the distributor, and asks for a meeting. The manager eventually reveals that he is the distributor, and that he cannot work with a drug addict like Jesse. Walt assures him that his product is the best there is, and that he only uses Jesse because he can count on his complete obedience. The manager assures Walt that he will be in touch if he decides to work with the duo, and warns Walt never to trust a drug addict.\n\n - Approximate: Jesse and Jane Margolis visit the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum and view her painting My Last Door. The two debate the meaning of the painting before Jane concludes that O'Keeffe was simply trying to make a good feeling last.\n\n - Skyler helps the company celebrate her boss Ted's birthday, where she sings him a sultry version of \"Happy Birthday to You\" reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe's \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\". She later finds, while investigating the accounts, that there are many inaccuracies in the payments to the company. Ted admits that he has evaded taxation on millions of dollars by under-reporting revenue to keep the company afloat and support its employees. Skyler says she will not turn him in, but cannot be a part of his illegal doings; however, she later comes back to work. Walt gets a message telling him to come to the restaurant, where he learns from the actual manager that the man he met is the owner of several stores, and that his name is Gus Fring. Just as Walt is about to leave, an associate of Gus named Victor blocks him from exiting and tells him to deliver the meth to a truck stop within the next hour in exchange for $1.2 Million cash. Walt rushes to Jesse's apartment and breaks in while Jesse and Jane are in a heroin-induced haze. At the same time, Skyler goes into labor and tries to contact Walt. Walt is tortured about his choice, but decides to go do the transaction anyway.\n\n- December 27, 2008: Holly born\n\n- December 28-31, 2008: Phoenix\n\n - Walt barely delivers the inventory of drugs to Gus in time, but misses his daughter's birth. He arrives at the hospital, where he finds that Ted drove Skyler to the hospital. At Jesse's apartment, Jane wakes up when she is phoned by her father, Donald, because she is late for a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. At lunch afterwards, she does not mention that she has started using heroin again, and acts as though she does not know Jesse when her father asks about him. Jesse, seeing the aftermath of Walt's search, initially believes he was robbed, but then listens to the phone messages Walt left. Jesse shows up at Walt's classroom to ask for his share of the money, which Walt refuses because he believes it will further Jesse’s addiction. He promises to pay Jesse when he knows that Jesse and Jane are clean.\n\n**2009**\n\n- Approximate: Leonel and Marco Salamanca are 32 years old\n\n- January 1-26, 2009: Phoenix\n\n - Jesse and Jane inject heroin in his apartment. As he passes out, Jesse complains about Walt holding out on him, telling Jane that he is owed $480,000. Donald calls Jane again when she is late to another rehab meeting; unbeknownst to Jane, he is waiting directly outside. Seeing her emerging from Jesse's door, he barges in and finds evidence of them both using heroin. He is furious that she has relapsed and calls the police, but Jane promises she will enter rehab the next day. He relents and gives her another chance. Meanwhile, Walt Jr. has put up a website so that people can donate to Walt's cancer surgery. Walt does not want to accept charity, especially because he earned the money to pay for his treatment, but cannot reveal its source to his family. Saul tells him that he will contact a hacker to make the money look like it is coming from computers all over the world, and avert suspicions by putting in small amounts.\n\n - Jane calls Walt to blackmail him into giving Jesse his share. Walt delivers the money to Jesse and Jane, who are ecstatic and talk of getting clean, but still feel a strong pull to use their remaining heroin. Walt goes to a bar to unwind, where he unknowingly sits next to Donald. The two start talking about the Phoenix probe's discovery of water on Mars and about Donald's daughter and Walt's \"nephew,\" voicing their frustrations over trying to help people who will not do what is good for them. Donald opines that one can never give up on one’s family. Motivated by Donald's words, Walt goes back to Jesse's house to talk to him, but finds Jesse and Jane passed out from heroin use. While Walt is trying to wake Jesse, he inadvertently knocks Jane onto her back; she starts to choke on her own vomit. Walt rushes to help, but then lets her die while Jesse lies passed out next to her. Before leaving the building, Walt begins to cry.\n\n- January 27 - February 12, 2009: ABQ\n\n - Jesse wakes from his heroin-induced sleep to find Jane Margolis dead, having choked on her own vomit. After a frenzied attempt at CPR, Jesse contacts Walter White for help. Feigning ignorance of Jane's death, Walt calls Saul Goodman. Saul sends Mike Ehrmantraut, a cleaner, to remove all evidence of drugs from Jesse's apartment and to coach him on how to interact with authorities. Jane's father Donald arrives at the apartment to find that his daughter has died, with Jesse being interviewed by the medical examiner. Jesse is unable to look Donald in the eyes, and, believing himself to be responsible for Jane's death, runs off to a crack house. Walt locates Jesse and takes him to rehab.\n\n - Meanwhile, Walt is preparing to undergo surgery to remove his cancer. The website that Walt Jr. made to bring in anonymous donations—in reality being used by Saul to launder Walt's drug money—has gained media attention due to its apparent success; Walt is uncomfortable in the spotlight. On the day of Walt's operation, as he is put under anesthetics, he accidentally reveals the existence of a second cell phone he uses, making Skyler White suspicious of his activities again.\n\n- February 13: Kim's 41st birthday\n\n- February 14 - February 17, 2009: ABQ\n\n - Six weeks later, after Walt is released from the hospital, Skyler reveals to him that she has investigated his behavior of the past several months and found out he has lied to her many times. Walt offers to tell her everything if she stays, but she is too afraid to know and decides to leave him. By this time, Donald has returned to work as an air traffic controller. While on the job, his mind wanders back to Jane's death; in his emotional state, he inadvertently allows the flight paths of two commercial airliners to cross over Albuquerque.\n\n - Walt is sitting beside his swimming pool when he is startled by an explosion overhead. He looks up to see a fireball in the sky above his house, the result of an apparent midair collison. Moments later, a charred pink teddy bear lands in the pool.\n\n - Numerous investigators from the NTSB collect and catalog debris, including a half-burnt pink teddy bear, that had fallen around the Whites' neighborhood. In the distance, two columns of smoke can be seen.\n\n[**Timeline VII &gt;&gt;&gt;**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Timelines/comments/hnym2v/gilliverse_vii/)",

Walt also demands no further bloodshed. Meanwhile, as Walt&amp;#39;s chemotherapy continues, he tells Skyler that Elliott&amp;#39;s check came and he deposited it, when in fact he is struggling to pay for the treatment and plans on using his meth profits to cover it. At a family therapy session, Skyler tells Walt that she is concerned about his missing hours, but he explains that he just likes to be alone sometimes and take walks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;While cooking meth, Jesse observes a radiotherapy burn on Walt&amp;#39;s chest and realizes he is trying to take care of his family before he dies of lung cancer. Jesse finishes their current batch and spends all night selling it, bringing Walt his share of $1,300, far less than he expected. Jesse explains they need a distributor if they want to make more money; after Krazy-8&amp;#39;s death, Tuco Salamanca has taken over his territory. Jesse gains a meeting with Tuco after getting his friend Skinny Pete, who served time in prison alongside Tuco, to vouch for him. Though Tuco is willing to pay $35,000 for a pound of meth, he insists on paying only after his dealers have completed the sales. When Jesse refuses, Tuco severely beats him and lands him in the hospital.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Hank traces the gas mask found in the desert to Walt&amp;#39;s high school. Hank and Walt take inventory of the chemistry lab to find other equipment missing, leading Hank to suspect that a student obtained a key to the lab storage room. Later, Hank arrests a school janitor named Hugo, who would have had the keys and had a previous record for drug possession. Walt feels guilty letting Hugo take the fall and tries to contact Jesse, only to learn about his hospitalization. He visits Jesse and learns what happened with Tuco.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Now starting to lose his hair from the chemo, Walt decides to shave off what remaining hair he has left. Afterwards, he arranges for a meeting with Tuco under the name &amp;quot;Heisenberg,&amp;quot; demanding $50,000 from Tuco—$35,000 for the meth Tuco took from Jesse, and $15,000 for pain and suffering for Jesse&amp;#39;s treatment. Seeing Walt with another bag of material, Tuco calls his bluff and threatens Walt. Walt throws a piece of the material against the floor which explodes. The entire floor is shaken, blowing out the windows and knocking everyone in the room off their feet. Walt reveals that the bag contains fulminated mercury. Walt threatens to smash the entire bag to the ground. Tuco submits and agrees to the payment as well as agreeing to a purchase for the next week, offering Walter $35,000 for the next pound of meth. Walt demands instead that Tuco buy two pounds of meth a week for $70,000. Tuco, incredulous, agrees. Walt leaves the building. Once back in his car, Walt exhibits an intense rush from what he has just done.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;October 25-31, 2008: A No Rough Stuff Type Deal&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At a high school PTA meeting, Walt fondles Skyler beneath the conference room table, arousing her. In the parking lot, the two of them have sex in the back of Walt&amp;#39;s car – Walt is beginning to get off on the danger of his situation. Jesse, who is now living in the RV, puts his house on the market because he is too traumatized by the deaths of Krazy-8 and Emilio to continue living there. Walt tells him about the deal with Tuco, but Jesse says producing two pounds of meth a week is impossible. His &amp;quot;smurfs&amp;quot; – people who supply him the pseudoephedrine needed to cook the meth – can only supply so much a week.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt and Jesse meet Tuco and his men at a junkyard, where they hand him approximately half a pound of meth. Tuco is furious that Walt&amp;#39;s end of the bargain was not kept and pays him only $17,000. He gives Walt another chance next week, but Walt says he still wants the $70,000 Tuco promised upfront, despite not having the goods. Tuco agrees to $52,500, which adds up to $65,625, but threatens dire consequences if next week&amp;#39;s quota is not met. To make up for it, Walt promises to have four pounds of meth at the next meeting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At Skyler&amp;#39;s baby shower, Marie presents her with an expensive white gold baby&amp;#39;s tiara. This seems to irritate Hank. In the yard, Walt and Hank have a philosophical conversation about the dividing line between legal and illegal behavior. That night, Walt tells Skyler that he is planning to spend a weekend at a holistic medical clinic after she expressed desire for alternative therapy. In reality, Walt is cooking meth with Jesse. Skyler goes to return the tiara and is detained in the store – it turns out that Marie stole it, but Skyler matches her description. She pretends to go into labor, persuading them to let her go. Skyler later confronts Marie about the theft, but Marie calmly denies it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt has a plan to manufacture the meth using different precursors, and gives Jesse a list of chemicals and equipment to acquire with the cash fronted by Tuco. Jesse gets almost everything Walt requested except methylamine, which is kept tightly controlled. Jesse knows of a chemical warehouse where there are men willing to steal and sell the methylamine for $10,000. Walt decides they will steal the methylamine themselves by using the aluminum powder in Etch-a-Sketches to make thermite. At night, Walt and Jesse trespass into the warehouse, subdue a security guard by locking him in a portable toilet, and place the thermite on a locked door, which melts the metal when lit. The two steal a 40 gallon drum of methylamine and escape.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The next day, Walt and Jesse attempt to start the RV when mechanical troubles prevent it from going anywhere. Faced with a deadline, they set up to cook in Jesse&amp;#39;s basement, unaware that his realtor has planned an open house viewing for that afternoon. Jesse guards the door to the basement while Walt synthesizes the chemicals, and once a man asks to see the basement, Jesse demands that everyone leave. When Walt arrives back home, he learns of Marie&amp;#39;s theft and wonders if Skyler would ever turn him in for a crime. At the next meeting with Tuco, Walt supplies 4.6 pounds of meth. Despite its blue hue, it is still the same quality and Tuco hands over $91,000. When one of Tuco&amp;#39;s men makes an offhanded remark to Walt, Tuco becomes furious and beats the man with his fists until he is unconscious. As Tuco drives away, Walt and Jesse look at each other in shock.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;October 31 - November 7, 2008: Seven Thirty-Seven&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the junkyard, after his purchase of meth from Walter White and Jesse, drug kingpin Tuco Salamanca viciously assaults his lieutenant, No-Doze, after he speaks to Walt in Tuco’s place. After Tuco departs, Walt calculates the amount of money he will need to provide for his family, concluding that the figure is $737,000. Tuco suddenly returns demanding that Walt save an unresponsive No-Doze. After he dies, Gonzo, the other man in Tuco’s employ, states that they should move the body, but Tuco refuses and leaves it in the junkyard.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt parts ways with Jesse and goes home. Skyler White finds him standing at the television, and he subsequently forces himself on her. After she makes him stop, Walt sits by the pool and is later found by Walter Jr. Meanwhile, Jesse acquires a firearm at a hot dog restaurant. The next day, he tells Walt that he believes Tuco poses a threat that must be taken care of. Walt points out that shooting him would end badly, and the pair seems despondent. Elsewhere, Skyler refuses to answer phone calls from her sister, Marie Schrader. Marie and her husband Hank argue about whether or not she attempted to schedule a dinner with Skyler in a way that conflicts with another appointment that she has for therapy, revealing that Marie reluctantly goes to therapy for unspecified problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At the DEA field office, Hank&amp;#39;s partner Steven Gomez shows him footage of Walt and Jesse&amp;#39;s methylamine robbery. Hank dismisses their ability as thieves, but is intrigued by the fact that the unknown pair stole methylamine and used thermite to enter the warehouse. Gomez speculates they may be college-aged chemistry students, and Hank hints that the two will encounter difficulty from the drug cartels for disrupting the meth trade. Walt becomes worried when he notices an SUV parked near his house and spends the night watching the street. Jesse encourages Walt to also purchase a gun, hoping to &amp;quot;double their chances&amp;quot; of success in the event of a shooting. Instead, Walt proposes that they kill Tuco in a more clandestine way, using ricin made from castor beans. Hank visits Skyler and asks her to make up with Marie. Skyler responds angrily, stating that her situation is worse than her sister’s. Hank and Skyler both realize that the other knows about Marie&amp;#39;s shoplifting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt and Jesse produce the ricin, hoping to trick Tuco into poisoning himself by placing it in the next meth delivery. As they finish their work, Walt receives a phone call from Hank, who is at a crime scene. Hank says that he screwed up in speaking to Skyler, and Walt forgives him. It is revealed that the crime scene Hank is investigating is the junkyard, and that Gonzo has accidentally died in a botched attempt to move No-Doze&amp;#39;s body. Walt and Jesse infer that Tuco killed Gonzo, and Walt insists that Jesse leave town. Walt returns home, where he avoids answering questions from Skyler. He receives a phone call and goes outside, where Jesse is being held at gunpoint in his car by Tuco. Tuco forces Walt to enter the car.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 8, 2008: Grilled&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Having been kidnapped by a crazed Tuco, Walt and Jesse are held prisoner in a desert hideout where he takes care of his sick uncle, the mute Hector Salamanca. Hector is incapacitated from the neck down and unable to speak, but can communicate with a desk bell attached to his wheelchair. Hank and the DEA have rounded up Tuco&amp;#39;s entire organization, and Tuco thinks that one of his associates ratted him out. He intends to keep Walt and Jesse in the compound until his cousins take them all across the border to Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hank, meanwhile, takes a bit of time off to look for Walt. Skyler is sick with worry and has been distributing handbills with Walt&amp;#39;s photo. Hank remembers that Jesse was Walt&amp;#39;s source of marijuana and tries to track him down. Walt tries unsuccessfully to poison a burrito Tuco prepares with the ricin he has prepared; Hector thwarts the attempt, prompting Tuco to lash out at Walt and Jesse. Tuco takes them outside and plans to kill them. Walt and Jesse manage to wound Tuco and escape. Hank shows up looking for Jesse, and is confronted by a wounded Tuco. A brief firefight ensues; Hank shoots and kills Tuco. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 8-11, 2008: Bit by a Dead Bee&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Having gotten away from Tuco, Walt and Jesse now have to get home and explain where they have been. Walt has a plan for both of them and they split up. Walt goes to a supermarket and takes off all of his clothes while walking around the aisles. He is hospitalized and claims to have no memory of where he has been for the last few days. The hospital is unable to find anything wrong with him, and Walt suggests that it was a combination of medication and chemotherapy that could have caused the episode. The hospital believes Walt is at risk for another fugue state and forces him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Walt admits to the psychiatrist after receiving assurances regarding patient confidentiality that he remembers everything and just wanted to get away for a while. They eventually agree to release him.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse returns to his house to clean out the basement and get rid of the RV where he and Walt have been making methamphetamine. When the DEA agents track him down, he claims that he has been with a prostitute, Wendy, for the weekend. The DEA does not believe him and bring in Tuco&amp;#39;s uncle Hector to identify him, but Hector refuses to cooperate with the authorities. They have to let Jesse go. Jesse tries to contact his parents, but they refuse to help him. That night, Walt convinces Jesse to continue cooking meth. Later, Hank gets a present at the station: Tuco&amp;#39;s teeth grill encased in a clear acrylic cube.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 12, 2008: Jimmy/Saul&amp;#39;s 48th birthday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 12-17, 2008: Down&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt and Jesse meet at a gas station to discuss their next move. Walt says he needs time to reassure his family after his &amp;quot;fugue state&amp;quot; before he can cook again, and gives Jesse $600. The next morning, Walt cheerily makes breakfast, clearly disturbing Skyler and Walt Jr.; Skyler abruptly leaves the house and does not return until much later, not telling Walt where she has been. Meanwhile, Jesse meets with an attorney and his parents, who tell him that they found the meth lab in his basement and are evicting him from his aunt&amp;#39;s house. They tell him he has 72 hours to leave, but the next morning Jesse&amp;#39;s mother arrives with workmen who take everything in the house to storage. Jesse at first tries to convince his mother that he can change, then angrily tells her that he earned the house by taking care of his cancer-stricken aunt while his mother did nothing. She loses her temper and slaps him.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hoping to reconnect with his son, Walt offers to give Walt Jr. a driving lesson while Skyler is out again. Walt Jr. shows his skill at driving, but Walt notices that he is using both feet to work the pedals. When Walt tries to get him to only use the right foot, Walt Jr. gets upset and accidentally hits a safety cone. Jesse searches for a place to stay, but all of his friends turn him away. While Jesse is making a call at the gas station, his motorcycle and all his remaining possessions are stolen. Dejected, Jesse breaks into the lot where his RV is being kept, but accidentally falls through a Port-a-Potty, drenching himself in waste. He sleeps in his RV, only able to breathe through a gas mask. The next morning, Clovis, the lot owner, finds him and demands the money he is owed, plus extra for repairs to the RV and the Port-a-Potty. Having no cash, Jesse begs for time to pay him back, but Clovis kicks him out and plans to sell his meth-cooking equipment. Jesse breaks back into the lot, steals his RV, and escapes by driving through the locked gate.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;While Walt Jr. is at school, Walt tries to have a conversation with Skyler. He apologizes for how he has been acting lately, but Skyler is still convinced he is hiding something and storms out when he won&amp;#39;t tell her what it is. Walt follows her out and sees the RV parked near his house. He confronts Jesse over making contact, and Jesse tells him he only wants his half of the money they&amp;#39;ve made and will disappear. Walt angrily states that he has done all the work while Jesse has done nothing, ranting that Jesse is a &amp;quot;pathetic junkie&amp;quot; who is too stupid to follow simple instructions. This causes Jesse to lose his temper and attack him, but he stops himself from beating Walt. Walt brings Jesse inside and gives him his half of the earnings, and then offers him breakfast. Meanwhile, back at the gas station, Skyler gets into her car and takes out a cigarette and lighter. She hesitates, thinking about her pregnancy, but starts smoking.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 18-29, 2008: Breakage&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt finishes his first round of chemotherapy and is told he will learn the results in two months&amp;#39; time, around when his baby is due. However, Walt begins to feel overwhelmed by the growing medical bills, and the money he made from Tuco is running out. While he is vomiting into the toilet, he finds something clogging it - the packet of cigarettes Skyler was smoking.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse returns to Clovis to make good on his word: he pays for the towing and repair of his gate. He also works out a deal to store his RV in Clovis&amp;#39; lot, and buys a used car from him. Next, he rents an apartment from Jane Margolis, who manages the property and lives next door. Although he likes the space, he has no credit history and can only pay in cash. She initially refuses to rent to him, but eventually agrees after raising the price for cash only.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hank is promoted to a high-ranking Albuquerque liaison for the DEA, and will have to split his time between the city and El Paso, Texas. He goes out to celebrate with his friends, but has a panic attack on the elevator ride down. The next day, he takes off work to bottle some of the beer he has brewed at home. Marie is confused at this behavior, but he assures her everything is all right. After she leaves, a bottle breaks during capping, cutting his hand.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Walt and Jesse meet again to discuss how to distribute their meth. Jesse does not want to work on his own now that the DEA have found him, and suggests building a network of dealers so that they can be both distributors and producers. Walt is initially reluctant, but Jesse threatens to walk if they don&amp;#39;t follow his plan. Later, Jesse invites his friends Combo, Skinny Pete, and Badger to his apartment, and discusses using them as dealers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At a cookout celebrating Hank&amp;#39;s promotion, Skyler demands that Marie apologize for giving Skyler the stolen tiara, or it will irreversibly drive a wedge between them; Marie tearfully does so.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse&amp;#39;s dealers are doing well selling their meth, until Skinny Pete is robbed by one of his customers. When Jesse gives Walt his share, minus the stolen money, he explains that it is breakage—revenue loss from damaged, lost, or stolen goods—that must be expected as the cost of doing business. Walt, however, worries what will happen when word gets out that they can be robbed with impunity. He later shows up at Jesse&amp;#39;s apartment and gives him a gun, telling him to take care of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He also confronts Skyler over her smoking, but she refuses to apologize for keeping secrets when he has been doing the same. That night, Hank is woken by what he thinks are gunshots, and goes through the house with his pistol drawn. It turns out to be caps popping off beer bottles due to pressure. The next day, he drives down to the Rio Grande and throws his trophy of Tuco&amp;#39;s grill into the river.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 30, 2008: Peekaboo&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse gets the address of the couple who ripped off Skinny Pete and goes to their dilapidated house. Upon breaking inside, he finds and tends to their young neglected son. When the couple returns home, Jesse holds them up and demands that they return his meth and his money. They give him part of the meth, claiming to have lost the other portion, and show him an ATM they have stolen from a convenience store. The husband, Spooge, works unsuccessfully to open the ATM. While Jesse is busy playing with the son, the wife knocks him unconscious, stealing his gun and drugs. Jesse wakes up to see Spooge trying to open the ATM from the bottom. His wife, angry that he keeps calling her a &amp;quot;skank&amp;quot;, knocks the ATM over, crushing him; she then takes his drugs and gets high on the couch. Jesse hurriedly takes back the gun, takes what money he can when the ATM pops open, and calls 9-1-1. He then brings the boy out of the house, tells him not to go back inside, and runs away.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On his first day back teaching after finishing chemotherapy, Walt teaches his class about Dr. Tracy Hall, the inventor of synthetic diamonds, who earned only a pittance for his invention while General Electric made an incalculable profit. At home, Skyler gets a call from Gretchen Schwartz, whom she still believes is paying Walt&amp;#39;s medical bills. Skyler invites Gretchen over that afternoon, but Gretchen quickly leaves when Walt arrives home. Walt asks Gretchen if Skyler told her anything; she does not answer. Walt then drives up to Santa Fe to apologize to Gretchen for lying, but Gretchen demands to know why Walt did it and how he has been paying for his treatment. Walt, angry at being cut out of Gray Matter Technologies, denies her any right to that information; Gretchen insists that Walt was the one who left by walking out of their past relationship. Walt curses at her. When Walt gets back home, Skyler tells him that Gretchen called to say that the Schwartzes will no longer be paying for Walt&amp;#39;s treatment. Realizing his cover has now been blown, Walt claims that the Schwartzes have gone broke, but promises that he and Skyler will be able to find the necessary money.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 1-2, 2008: Negro y Azul&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The episode opens with the narcocorrido band Los Cuates de Sinaloa performing &amp;quot;Negro y Azul&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Black and Blue&amp;quot;), which is about how &amp;quot;a gringo boss&amp;quot; named Heisenberg is disrespecting the Mexican drug cartel by cornering the Albuquerque market with high-quality blue crystal methamphetamine.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt has trouble getting in touch with Jesse and goes to his apartment. Jesse has been staying inside and smoking marijuana since witnessing Spooge&amp;#39;s murder. Walt is at first horrified that someone was murdered, but calms down upon learning that nobody can identify Jesse. A call comes in from Badger to set up a deal. Walt is forced to meet Jesse&amp;#39;s dealers and learns they are now afraid of Jesse following a rumor that he killed Spooge. Walt uses Jesse&amp;#39;s new underworld reputation to galvanize him into helping expand their operation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hank is having trouble fitting in at the DEA office in El Paso, Texas, where his sense of humor is not appreciated and his coworkers do not respect him, partly due to his lack of ability in speaking Spanish. At a meeting with a cartel informant nicknamed &amp;quot;Tortuga&amp;quot;, Hank loses his patience at the man&amp;#39;s demands and his apparent disrespect. Some days later, while waiting for a meeting in the desert, Hank spots a message from the cartels: Tortuga&amp;#39;s severed head, mounted on top of a tortoise. Sickened by the grotesque display, Hank moves away from the tortoise. Doing so saves his life when a bomb strapped to the tortoise goes off, killing one agent and wounding three others.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Due to financial constraints, Skyler goes to her old company to apply for an entry-level job. She meets with her old friend and boss, Ted Beneke, who has taken over the company after his father&amp;#39;s death. He decides to give Skyler her old job in the accounting department. Walt is concerned over Skyler&amp;#39;s health at the workplace, especially since she originally left due to health problems from the company&amp;#39;s manufacturing. There is an obvious sexual tension between Skyler and Beneke; he reveals that he recently separated from his wife, the mother of his two children.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse sees his landlady, Jane Margolis, drawing on their front steps, and connects with her over their love of art. However, he is identified by a passing motorcyclist who has heard of his reputation, and it is revealed that he lied to her about his name. After he later admits to lying to her, she says that she doesn&amp;#39;t care what he does as long as he doesn&amp;#39;t do it at the house. He invites her inside to watch TV, even though he can&amp;#39;t get his new television working. She holds his hand as they stare at the blank television.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 3-5, 2008: Better Call Saul&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After Badger is arrested in a sting operation by the Albuquerque Police, Walt and Jesse look into hiring a shady, flamboyant lawyer named Saul Goodman. Saul has already offered to be Badger&amp;#39;s legal counsel and has found out that the DEA is hoping that Badger will lead them to &amp;quot;Heisenberg.&amp;quot; Walt poses as Badger&amp;#39;s uncle and goes to Saul&amp;#39;s office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to flip to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from confessing, but Saul refuses.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt and Jesse resort to kidnapping Saul, threatening to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing on them. However, Saul sees through their scare tactics and instead asks for payment so he can legally represent them, and keep their talks confidential. Saul tells the duo about a man, Jimmy &amp;quot;In-&amp;#39;N-Out&amp;quot; Kilkelly, who makes a living being paid by other criminals to go to jail, and offers to have him stand in for Heisenberg. The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger gives them a fake deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school, telling him that he is too easy to find. Saul offers to be Walt&amp;#39;s full-time legal counsel and adviser in covering his tracks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Skyler goes to work on a Saturday, and Walt notices that she is dressing especially well for her job with Ted. Seeing that Hank has holed himself in his house, Walt gives him a motivational speech, talking about how he has not had any fear in his life since he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. This helps Hank leave the house, but he still has panic attacks. Meanwhile, Jesse has slept with Jane and learns she is in recovery from addiction. Later, after Jesse orders a mattress for his apartment, he and Jane have sex once again.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 6-12, 2008: Four Days Out&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt arrives at the hospital with his family for a CT scan to learn how he has reacted to chemotherapy. He is told that the results of the test will not be ready for a week, but sees a scan of his lungs and notices a prominent growth. Believing that he has little time left, and realizing that recent expenses and Saul Goodman&amp;#39;s fees for laundering his money leave him with little to give his family, Walt decides to spend several days doing nothing but cooking meth. Walt makes up a story about visiting his mother for an extended weekend to be able to explain his absence to Skyler. He convinces Jesse to help for the weekend; Jesse is initially reluctant but cancels his plans to go on a date in Santa Fe with Jane when Walt claims they need to use as much of their supply of methylamine as possible before it goes bad.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After Jesse collects the additional supplies and picks Walter up from the airport, they drive the RV out to the desert to cook. Walt tells Jesse to leave the keys in a safe spot, and Jesse leaves them in the ignition switch, unaware that it is draining the vehicle&amp;#39;s battery. After a few days of cooking, Walt estimates they have nearly $1.2 million in meth. With their portable generator out of gasoline, Walt wants to get more gasoline and get right back to work, but Jesse convinces him they should take a break to find a hotel for the night. When they go to start the RV, they find the battery dead. They attempt to siphon off gasoline from the RV to the generator to jump start the vehicle, but gas spilled in the process causes the generator to catch fire, and Jesse uses all of their drinking water to douse it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse suggests they call Skinny Pete for help using Walt&amp;#39;s cell phone; despite knowing that Skyler will likely discover this in his cell phone records, Walt allows Jesse to make the call. Jesse tries to give directions to Skinny Pete, but they are unsure if he got them all. When Skinny Pete does not arrive, they call him again, and discover he is far off the directions before the phone dies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walter tears down the generator to allow him to try to trickle charge the RV&amp;#39;s battery by manually turning the generator&amp;#39;s crank. Though this briefly enables the engine to turn over, the battery quickly dies. Walt becomes depressed and starts suffering from heat exhaustion. Jesse realizes that Walt believes he is going to die, evidenced later when Walt coughs up blood. Walt believes he deserves to die as he has constantly lied to his family. Jesse tries to cheer Walt from his slump, and this inspires Walt to construct their own battery from the materials they have on hand. The makeshift battery provides enough power to jump-start the RV, and they are able to return to Albuquerque. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walter and Jesse have breakfast, estimating they will make more than $1 million, Walter laments having waited his entire life to do something special and says Jesse is lucky because he will not have to wait. Jesse drops Walt at the airport, assuring Walt that if Walt dies, his family will get their share of the money.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt and his family return to the doctor the next week, and learn that Walt&amp;#39;s cancer is in remission; the &amp;quot;growth&amp;quot; Walt spotted was simply inflamed tissue in his lung, and a resulting tear in his esophagus caused him to cough up blood, but will heal in time. Walt&amp;#39;s family is ecstatic, but Walt, privately, has a violent outburst realizing that death will not put an end to his web of lies or his drug dealing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Approximate: Methamphetamine manufacturer Gale Boetticher excitedly sets up equipment in an underground meth superlab for drug kingpin Gus Fring. Gale asks Gus about the blue meth being produced by chemist Walter White, who is not yet working for Gus. Gus explains he has reservations about hiring Walter, but Gale insists Gus hire him because of his superior product.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 13-18, 2008: Over&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Following his discovery that he is in remission, Walt takes Skyler&amp;#39;s advice to take the week off from work, but secretly meets with Jesse. He tells Jesse the good news, and that he is out of the drug trade now that he no longer has to pay for treatment. During Skyler&amp;#39;s party celebrating the remission, Walt pours Walt Jr. some tequila that he and Hank are drinking. After Walt keeps pouring, Hank takes the bottle away from him. Walt angrily demands it back, leading to a tense standoff which is broken as Walt Jr. vomits into the pool.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The next day, Skyler refuses to answer Walt&amp;#39;s calls in which he tries to apologize. In order to distract himself, he goes on a home improvement spree, replacing their water heater. At work, Skyler confides in Ted about Walt&amp;#39;s condition. When Ted notices that she is purposefully staying late, she breaks down, saying that she doesn&amp;#39;t feel optimistic because she knows that Walt still has cancer. Ted understands, having suffered physically while caring for his dying father. They tenderly hold hands. The next day, as Ted is leaving, Skyler creates a distraction in order to spend more time with him.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At the hardware store, Walt notices the cart of a young man buying materials to make drugs. He offers advice about what ingredients to get, causing the man to run away. Outside in the parking lot, he sees the young man with his partner; Walt orders the two to stay out of his territory. Meanwhile, Jesse clumsily makes breakfast for Jane and tells her they can spend the day together. She admires his drawings of superheroes, which she points out all look like him. They hear knocking on Jane&amp;#39;s door, which turns out to be her father, the owner of the property. When Jesse goes outside to speak with him, Jane acts like she does not know him. Later, she tells him she was protecting him from her overbearing father, but Jesse is upset that she does not take their relationship seriously. He smokes meth to comfort himself, but brightens when Jane slides a drawing under his door: a superhero called &amp;quot;Apology Girl&amp;quot; that looks like her.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 19-27, 2008: Mandala&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Combo is selling drugs on a corner when he notices two rival dealers staring him down; he is then killed by a young boy working for them. Skinny Pete, spooked by Combo’s death and Badger&amp;#39;s recent brush with the law, decides to quit the drug trade. Walt and Jesse meet with Saul to discuss their next move; he tells them that they are incompetent distributors, and need a businessman who is more restrained than Tuco and will buy their product in bulk. He offers to reach out to the only distributor of that kind he has heard of, but it will be difficult, as the man is extremely cautious. Jesse is distraught that he got Combo killed, and that night tells Jane to leave his apartment so that he does not harm her recovery when he smokes meth. Jane reluctantly decides to stay with him.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The next day, Walt waits at a local chicken restaurant called Los Pollos Hermanos, where the distributor has arranged to meet them; Jesse comes in late, still high, and leaves quickly afterwards. Nobody talks to Walt, but he realizes later that the distributor saw him and has refused to work with him. Meanwhile, Jane relapses into drug addiction and introduces Jesse to heroin. The next day, Walt goes back to the same restaurant and waits until closing. He eventually realizes that the man he assumes is the restaurant manager is in fact the distributor, and asks for a meeting. The manager eventually reveals that he is the distributor, and that he cannot work with a drug addict like Jesse. Walt assures him that his product is the best there is, and that he only uses Jesse because he can count on his complete obedience. The manager assures Walt that he will be in touch if he decides to work with the duo, and warns Walt never to trust a drug addict.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Approximate: Jesse and Jane Margolis visit the Georgia O&amp;#39;Keeffe Museum and view her painting My Last Door. The two debate the meaning of the painting before Jane concludes that O&amp;#39;Keeffe was simply trying to make a good feeling last.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Skyler helps the company celebrate her boss Ted&amp;#39;s birthday, where she sings him a sultry version of &amp;quot;Happy Birthday to You&amp;quot; reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Happy Birthday, Mr. President&amp;quot;. She later finds, while investigating the accounts, that there are many inaccuracies in the payments to the company. Ted admits that he has evaded taxation on millions of dollars by under-reporting revenue to keep the company afloat and support its employees. Skyler says she will not turn him in, but cannot be a part of his illegal doings; however, she later comes back to work. Walt gets a message telling him to come to the restaurant, where he learns from the actual manager that the man he met is the owner of several stores, and that his name is Gus Fring. Just as Walt is about to leave, an associate of Gus named Victor blocks him from exiting and tells him to deliver the meth to a truck stop within the next hour in exchange for $1.2 Million cash. Walt rushes to Jesse&amp;#39;s apartment and breaks in while Jesse and Jane are in a heroin-induced haze. At the same time, Skyler goes into labor and tries to contact Walt. Walt is tortured about his choice, but decides to go do the transaction anyway.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 27, 2008: Holly born&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 28-31, 2008: Phoenix&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt barely delivers the inventory of drugs to Gus in time, but misses his daughter&amp;#39;s birth. He arrives at the hospital, where he finds that Ted drove Skyler to the hospital. At Jesse&amp;#39;s apartment, Jane wakes up when she is phoned by her father, Donald, because she is late for a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. At lunch afterwards, she does not mention that she has started using heroin again, and acts as though she does not know Jesse when her father asks about him. Jesse, seeing the aftermath of Walt&amp;#39;s search, initially believes he was robbed, but then listens to the phone messages Walt left. Jesse shows up at Walt&amp;#39;s classroom to ask for his share of the money, which Walt refuses because he believes it will further Jesse’s addiction. He promises to pay Jesse when he knows that Jesse and Jane are clean.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximate: Leonel and Marco Salamanca are 32 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 1-26, 2009: Phoenix&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse and Jane inject heroin in his apartment. As he passes out, Jesse complains about Walt holding out on him, telling Jane that he is owed $480,000. Donald calls Jane again when she is late to another rehab meeting; unbeknownst to Jane, he is waiting directly outside. Seeing her emerging from Jesse&amp;#39;s door, he barges in and finds evidence of them both using heroin. He is furious that she has relapsed and calls the police, but Jane promises she will enter rehab the next day. He relents and gives her another chance. Meanwhile, Walt Jr. has put up a website so that people can donate to Walt&amp;#39;s cancer surgery. Walt does not want to accept charity, especially because he earned the money to pay for his treatment, but cannot reveal its source to his family. Saul tells him that he will contact a hacker to make the money look like it is coming from computers all over the world, and avert suspicions by putting in small amounts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jane calls Walt to blackmail him into giving Jesse his share. Walt delivers the money to Jesse and Jane, who are ecstatic and talk of getting clean, but still feel a strong pull to use their remaining heroin. Walt goes to a bar to unwind, where he unknowingly sits next to Donald. The two start talking about the Phoenix probe&amp;#39;s discovery of water on Mars and about Donald&amp;#39;s daughter and Walt&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;nephew,&amp;quot; voicing their frustrations over trying to help people who will not do what is good for them. Donald opines that one can never give up on one’s family. Motivated by Donald&amp;#39;s words, Walt goes back to Jesse&amp;#39;s house to talk to him, but finds Jesse and Jane passed out from heroin use. While Walt is trying to wake Jesse, he inadvertently knocks Jane onto her back; she starts to choke on her own vomit. Walt rushes to help, but then lets her die while Jesse lies passed out next to her. Before leaving the building, Walt begins to cry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 27 - February 12, 2009: ABQ&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse wakes from his heroin-induced sleep to find Jane Margolis dead, having choked on her own vomit. After a frenzied attempt at CPR, Jesse contacts Walter White for help. Feigning ignorance of Jane&amp;#39;s death, Walt calls Saul Goodman. Saul sends Mike Ehrmantraut, a cleaner, to remove all evidence of drugs from Jesse&amp;#39;s apartment and to coach him on how to interact with authorities. Jane&amp;#39;s father Donald arrives at the apartment to find that his daughter has died, with Jesse being interviewed by the medical examiner. Jesse is unable to look Donald in the eyes, and, believing himself to be responsible for Jane&amp;#39;s death, runs off to a crack house. Walt locates Jesse and takes him to rehab.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Walt is preparing to undergo surgery to remove his cancer. The website that Walt Jr. made to bring in anonymous donations—in reality being used by Saul to launder Walt&amp;#39;s drug money—has gained media attention due to its apparent success; Walt is uncomfortable in the spotlight. On the day of Walt&amp;#39;s operation, as he is put under anesthetics, he accidentally reveals the existence of a second cell phone he uses, making Skyler White suspicious of his activities again.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 13: Kim&amp;#39;s 41st birthday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 14 - February 17, 2009: ABQ&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Six weeks later, after Walt is released from the hospital, Skyler reveals to him that she has investigated his behavior of the past several months and found out he has lied to her many times. Walt offers to tell her everything if she stays, but she is too afraid to know and decides to leave him. By this time, Donald has returned to work as an air traffic controller. While on the job, his mind wanders back to Jane&amp;#39;s death; in his emotional state, he inadvertently allows the flight paths of two commercial airliners to cross over Albuquerque.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt is sitting beside his swimming pool when he is startled by an explosion overhead. He looks up to see a fireball in the sky above his house, the result of an apparent midair collison. Moments later, a charred pink teddy bear lands in the pool.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Numerous investigators from the NTSB collect and catalog debris, including a half-burnt pink teddy bear, that had fallen around the Whites&amp;#39; neighborhood. In the distance, two columns of smoke can be seen.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Timelines/comments/hnym2v/gilliverse_vii/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline VII &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Walt also demands no further bloodshed. Meanwhile, as Walt's chemotherapy continues, he tells Skyler that Elliott's check came and he deposited it, when in fact he is struggling to pay for the treatment and plans on using his meth profits to cover it. At a family therapy session, Skyler tells Walt that she is concerned about his missing hours, but he explains that he just likes to be alone sometimes and take walks.\n\n - While cooking meth, Jesse observes a radiotherapy burn on Walt's chest and realizes he is trying to take care of his family before he dies of lung cancer. Jesse finishes their current batch and spends all night selling it, bringing Walt his share of $1,300, far less than he expected. Jesse explains they need a distributor if they want to make more money; after Krazy-8's death, Tuco Salamanca has taken over his territory. Jesse gains a meeting with Tuco after getting his friend Skinny Pete, who served time in prison alongside Tuco, to vouch for him. Though Tuco is willing to pay $35,000 for a pound of meth, he insists on paying only after his dealers have completed the sales. When Jesse refuses, Tuco severely beats him and lands him in the hospital.\n\n - Meanwhile, Hank traces the gas mask found in the desert to Walt's high school. Hank and Walt take inventory of the chemistry lab to find other equipment missing, leading Hank to suspect that a student obtained a key to the lab storage room. Later, Hank arrests a school janitor named Hugo, who would have had the keys and had a previous record for drug possession. Walt feels guilty letting Hugo take the fall and tries to contact Jesse, only to learn about his hospitalization. He visits Jesse and learns what happened with Tuco.\n\n - Now starting to lose his hair from the chemo, Walt decides to shave off what remaining hair he has left. Afterwards, he arranges for a meeting with Tuco under the name \"Heisenberg,\" demanding $50,000 from Tuco—$35,000 for the meth Tuco took from Jesse, and $15,000 for pain and suffering for Jesse's treatment. Seeing Walt with another bag of material, Tuco calls his bluff and threatens Walt. Walt throws a piece of the material against the floor which explodes. The entire floor is shaken, blowing out the windows and knocking everyone in the room off their feet. Walt reveals that the bag contains fulminated mercury. Walt threatens to smash the entire bag to the ground. Tuco submits and agrees to the payment as well as agreeing to a purchase for the next week, offering Walter $35,000 for the next pound of meth. Walt demands instead that Tuco buy two pounds of meth a week for $70,000. Tuco, incredulous, agrees. Walt leaves the building. Once back in his car, Walt exhibits an intense rush from what he has just done.\n\n- October 25-31, 2008: A No Rough Stuff Type Deal\n\n - At a high school PTA meeting, Walt fondles Skyler beneath the conference room table, arousing her. In the parking lot, the two of them have sex in the back of Walt's car – Walt is beginning to get off on the danger of his situation. Jesse, who is now living in the RV, puts his house on the market because he is too traumatized by the deaths of Krazy-8 and Emilio to continue living there. Walt tells him about the deal with Tuco, but Jesse says producing two pounds of meth a week is impossible. His \"smurfs\" – people who supply him the pseudoephedrine needed to cook the meth – can only supply so much a week.\n\n - Walt and Jesse meet Tuco and his men at a junkyard, where they hand him approximately half a pound of meth. Tuco is furious that Walt's end of the bargain was not kept and pays him only $17,000. He gives Walt another chance next week, but Walt says he still wants the $70,000 Tuco promised upfront, despite not having the goods. Tuco agrees to $52,500, which adds up to $65,625, but threatens dire consequences if next week's quota is not met. To make up for it, Walt promises to have four pounds of meth at the next meeting.\n\n - At Skyler's baby shower, Marie presents her with an expensive white gold baby's tiara. This seems to irritate Hank. In the yard, Walt and Hank have a philosophical conversation about the dividing line between legal and illegal behavior. That night, Walt tells Skyler that he is planning to spend a weekend at a holistic medical clinic after she expressed desire for alternative therapy. In reality, Walt is cooking meth with Jesse. Skyler goes to return the tiara and is detained in the store – it turns out that Marie stole it, but Skyler matches her description. She pretends to go into labor, persuading them to let her go. Skyler later confronts Marie about the theft, but Marie calmly denies it.\n\n - Walt has a plan to manufacture the meth using different precursors, and gives Jesse a list of chemicals and equipment to acquire with the cash fronted by Tuco. Jesse gets almost everything Walt requested except methylamine, which is kept tightly controlled. Jesse knows of a chemical warehouse where there are men willing to steal and sell the methylamine for $10,000. Walt decides they will steal the methylamine themselves by using the aluminum powder in Etch-a-Sketches to make thermite. At night, Walt and Jesse trespass into the warehouse, subdue a security guard by locking him in a portable toilet, and place the thermite on a locked door, which melts the metal when lit. The two steal a 40 gallon drum of methylamine and escape.\n\n - The next day, Walt and Jesse attempt to start the RV when mechanical troubles prevent it from going anywhere. Faced with a deadline, they set up to cook in Jesse's basement, unaware that his realtor has planned an open house viewing for that afternoon. Jesse guards the door to the basement while Walt synthesizes the chemicals, and once a man asks to see the basement, Jesse demands that everyone leave. When Walt arrives back home, he learns of Marie's theft and wonders if Skyler would ever turn him in for a crime. At the next meeting with Tuco, Walt supplies 4.6 pounds of meth. Despite its blue hue, it is still the same quality and Tuco hands over $91,000. When one of Tuco's men makes an offhanded remark to Walt, Tuco becomes furious and beats the man with his fists until he is unconscious. As Tuco drives away, Walt and Jesse look at each other in shock.\n\n- October 31 - November 7, 2008: Seven Thirty-Seven\n\n - In the junkyard, after his purchase of meth from Walter White and Jesse, drug kingpin Tuco Salamanca viciously assaults his lieutenant, No-Doze, after he speaks to Walt in Tuco’s place. After Tuco departs, Walt calculates the amount of money he will need to provide for his family, concluding that the figure is $737,000. Tuco suddenly returns demanding that Walt save an unresponsive No-Doze. After he dies, Gonzo, the other man in Tuco’s employ, states that they should move the body, but Tuco refuses and leaves it in the junkyard.\n\n - Walt parts ways with Jesse and goes home. Skyler White finds him standing at the television, and he subsequently forces himself on her. After she makes him stop, Walt sits by the pool and is later found by Walter Jr. Meanwhile, Jesse acquires a firearm at a hot dog restaurant. The next day, he tells Walt that he believes Tuco poses a threat that must be taken care of. Walt points out that shooting him would end badly, and the pair seems despondent. Elsewhere, Skyler refuses to answer phone calls from her sister, Marie Schrader. Marie and her husband Hank argue about whether or not she attempted to schedule a dinner with Skyler in a way that conflicts with another appointment that she has for therapy, revealing that Marie reluctantly goes to therapy for unspecified problems.\n\n - At the DEA field office, Hank's partner Steven Gomez shows him footage of Walt and Jesse's methylamine robbery. Hank dismisses their ability as thieves, but is intrigued by the fact that the unknown pair stole methylamine and used thermite to enter the warehouse. Gomez speculates they may be college-aged chemistry students, and Hank hints that the two will encounter difficulty from the drug cartels for disrupting the meth trade. Walt becomes worried when he notices an SUV parked near his house and spends the night watching the street. Jesse encourages Walt to also purchase a gun, hoping to \"double their chances\" of success in the event of a shooting. Instead, Walt proposes that they kill Tuco in a more clandestine way, using ricin made from castor beans. Hank visits Skyler and asks her to make up with Marie. Skyler responds angrily, stating that her situation is worse than her sister’s. Hank and Skyler both realize that the other knows about Marie's shoplifting.\n\n - Walt and Jesse produce the ricin, hoping to trick Tuco into poisoning himself by placing it in the next meth delivery. As they finish their work, Walt receives a phone call from Hank, who is at a crime scene. Hank says that he screwed up in speaking to Skyler, and Walt forgives him. It is revealed that the crime scene Hank is investigating is the junkyard, and that Gonzo has accidentally died in a botched attempt to move No-Doze's body. Walt and Jesse infer that Tuco killed Gonzo, and Walt insists that Jesse leave town. Walt returns home, where he avoids answering questions from Skyler. He receives a phone call and goes outside, where Jesse is being held at gunpoint in his car by Tuco. Tuco forces Walt to enter the car.\n\n- November 8, 2008: Grilled\n\n - Having been kidnapped by a crazed Tuco, Walt and Jesse are held prisoner in a desert hideout where he takes care of his sick uncle, the mute Hector Salamanca. Hector is incapacitated from the neck down and unable to speak, but can communicate with a desk bell attached to his wheelchair. Hank and the DEA have rounded up Tuco's entire organization, and Tuco thinks that one of his associates ratted him out. He intends to keep Walt and Jesse in the compound until his cousins take them all across the border to Mexico.\n\n - Hank, meanwhile, takes a bit of time off to look for Walt. Skyler is sick with worry and has been distributing handbills with Walt's photo. Hank remembers that Jesse was Walt's source of marijuana and tries to track him down. Walt tries unsuccessfully to poison a burrito Tuco prepares with the ricin he has prepared; Hector thwarts the attempt, prompting Tuco to lash out at Walt and Jesse. Tuco takes them outside and plans to kill them. Walt and Jesse manage to wound Tuco and escape. Hank shows up looking for Jesse, and is confronted by a wounded Tuco. A brief firefight ensues; Hank shoots and kills Tuco. \n\n- November 8-11, 2008: Bit by a Dead Bee\n\n - Having gotten away from Tuco, Walt and Jesse now have to get home and explain where they have been. Walt has a plan for both of them and they split up. Walt goes to a supermarket and takes off all of his clothes while walking around the aisles. He is hospitalized and claims to have no memory of where he has been for the last few days. The hospital is unable to find anything wrong with him, and Walt suggests that it was a combination of medication and chemotherapy that could have caused the episode. The hospital believes Walt is at risk for another fugue state and forces him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Walt admits to the psychiatrist after receiving assurances regarding patient confidentiality that he remembers everything and just wanted to get away for a while. They eventually agree to release him.\n\n - Jesse returns to his house to clean out the basement and get rid of the RV where he and Walt have been making methamphetamine. When the DEA agents track him down, he claims that he has been with a prostitute, Wendy, for the weekend. The DEA does not believe him and bring in Tuco's uncle Hector to identify him, but Hector refuses to cooperate with the authorities. They have to let Jesse go. Jesse tries to contact his parents, but they refuse to help him. That night, Walt convinces Jesse to continue cooking meth. Later, Hank gets a present at the station: Tuco's teeth grill encased in a clear acrylic cube.\n\n- November 12, 2008: Jimmy/Saul's 48th birthday\n\n- November 12-17, 2008: Down\n\n - Walt and Jesse meet at a gas station to discuss their next move. Walt says he needs time to reassure his family after his \"fugue state\" before he can cook again, and gives Jesse $600. The next morning, Walt cheerily makes breakfast, clearly disturbing Skyler and Walt Jr.; Skyler abruptly leaves the house and does not return until much later, not telling Walt where she has been. Meanwhile, Jesse meets with an attorney and his parents, who tell him that they found the meth lab in his basement and are evicting him from his aunt's house. They tell him he has 72 hours to leave, but the next morning Jesse's mother arrives with workmen who take everything in the house to storage. Jesse at first tries to convince his mother that he can change, then angrily tells her that he earned the house by taking care of his cancer-stricken aunt while his mother did nothing. She loses her temper and slaps him.\n\n - Hoping to reconnect with his son, Walt offers to give Walt Jr. a driving lesson while Skyler is out again. Walt Jr. shows his skill at driving, but Walt notices that he is using both feet to work the pedals. When Walt tries to get him to only use the right foot, Walt Jr. gets upset and accidentally hits a safety cone. Jesse searches for a place to stay, but all of his friends turn him away. While Jesse is making a call at the gas station, his motorcycle and all his remaining possessions are stolen. Dejected, Jesse breaks into the lot where his RV is being kept, but accidentally falls through a Port-a-Potty, drenching himself in waste. He sleeps in his RV, only able to breathe through a gas mask. The next morning, Clovis, the lot owner, finds him and demands the money he is owed, plus extra for repairs to the RV and the Port-a-Potty. Having no cash, Jesse begs for time to pay him back, but Clovis kicks him out and plans to sell his meth-cooking equipment. Jesse breaks back into the lot, steals his RV, and escapes by driving through the locked gate.\n\n - While Walt Jr. is at school, Walt tries to have a conversation with Skyler. He apologizes for how he has been acting lately, but Skyler is still convinced he is hiding something and storms out when he won't tell her what it is. Walt follows her out and sees the RV parked near his house. He confronts Jesse over making contact, and Jesse tells him he only wants his half of the money they've made and will disappear. Walt angrily states that he has done all the work while Jesse has done nothing, ranting that Jesse is a \"pathetic junkie\" who is too stupid to follow simple instructions. This causes Jesse to lose his temper and attack him, but he stops himself from beating Walt. Walt brings Jesse inside and gives him his half of the earnings, and then offers him breakfast. Meanwhile, back at the gas station, Skyler gets into her car and takes out a cigarette and lighter. She hesitates, thinking about her pregnancy, but starts smoking.\n\n- November 18-29, 2008: Breakage\n\n - Walt finishes his first round of chemotherapy and is told he will learn the results in two months' time, around when his baby is due. However, Walt begins to feel overwhelmed by the growing medical bills, and the money he made from Tuco is running out. While he is vomiting into the toilet, he finds something clogging it - the packet of cigarettes Skyler was smoking.\n\n - Jesse returns to Clovis to make good on his word: he pays for the towing and repair of his gate. He also works out a deal to store his RV in Clovis' lot, and buys a used car from him. Next, he rents an apartment from Jane Margolis, who manages the property and lives next door. Although he likes the space, he has no credit history and can only pay in cash. She initially refuses to rent to him, but eventually agrees after raising the price for cash only.\n\n - Hank is promoted to a high-ranking Albuquerque liaison for the DEA, and will have to split his time between the city and El Paso, Texas. He goes out to celebrate with his friends, but has a panic attack on the elevator ride down. The next day, he takes off work to bottle some of the beer he has brewed at home. Marie is confused at this behavior, but he assures her everything is all right. After she leaves, a bottle breaks during capping, cutting his hand.\n\n - Meanwhile, Walt and Jesse meet again to discuss how to distribute their meth. Jesse does not want to work on his own now that the DEA have found him, and suggests building a network of dealers so that they can be both distributors and producers. Walt is initially reluctant, but Jesse threatens to walk if they don't follow his plan. Later, Jesse invites his friends Combo, Skinny Pete, and Badger to his apartment, and discusses using them as dealers.\n\n - At a cookout celebrating Hank's promotion, Skyler demands that Marie apologize for giving Skyler the stolen tiara, or it will irreversibly drive a wedge between them; Marie tearfully does so.\n\n - Jesse's dealers are doing well selling their meth, until Skinny Pete is robbed by one of his customers. When Jesse gives Walt his share, minus the stolen money, he explains that it is breakage—revenue loss from damaged, lost, or stolen goods—that must be expected as the cost of doing business. Walt, however, worries what will happen when word gets out that they can be robbed with impunity. He later shows up at Jesse's apartment and gives him a gun, telling him to take care of the problem.\n\n - He also confronts Skyler over her smoking, but she refuses to apologize for keeping secrets when he has been doing the same. That night, Hank is woken by what he thinks are gunshots, and goes through the house with his pistol drawn. It turns out to be caps popping off beer bottles due to pressure. The next day, he drives down to the Rio Grande and throws his trophy of Tuco's grill into the river.\n\n- November 30, 2008: Peekaboo\n\n - Jesse gets the address of the couple who ripped off Skinny Pete and goes to their dilapidated house. Upon breaking inside, he finds and tends to their young neglected son. When the couple returns home, Jesse holds them up and demands that they return his meth and his money. They give him part of the meth, claiming to have lost the other portion, and show him an ATM they have stolen from a convenience store. The husband, Spooge, works unsuccessfully to open the ATM. While Jesse is busy playing with the son, the wife knocks him unconscious, stealing his gun and drugs. Jesse wakes up to see Spooge trying to open the ATM from the bottom. His wife, angry that he keeps calling her a \"skank\", knocks the ATM over, crushing him; she then takes his drugs and gets high on the couch. Jesse hurriedly takes back the gun, takes what money he can when the ATM pops open, and calls 9-1-1. He then brings the boy out of the house, tells him not to go back inside, and runs away.\n\n - On his first day back teaching after finishing chemotherapy, Walt teaches his class about Dr. Tracy Hall, the inventor of synthetic diamonds, who earned only a pittance for his invention while General Electric made an incalculable profit. At home, Skyler gets a call from Gretchen Schwartz, whom she still believes is paying Walt's medical bills. Skyler invites Gretchen over that afternoon, but Gretchen quickly leaves when Walt arrives home. Walt asks Gretchen if Skyler told her anything; she does not answer. Walt then drives up to Santa Fe to apologize to Gretchen for lying, but Gretchen demands to know why Walt did it and how he has been paying for his treatment. Walt, angry at being cut out of Gray Matter Technologies, denies her any right to that information; Gretchen insists that Walt was the one who left by walking out of their past relationship. Walt curses at her. When Walt gets back home, Skyler tells him that Gretchen called to say that the Schwartzes will no longer be paying for Walt's treatment. Realizing his cover has now been blown, Walt claims that the Schwartzes have gone broke, but promises that he and Skyler will be able to find the necessary money.\n\n- December 1-2, 2008: Negro y Azul\n\n - The episode opens with the narcocorrido band Los Cuates de Sinaloa performing \"Negro y Azul\" (\"Black and Blue\"), which is about how \"a gringo boss\" named Heisenberg is disrespecting the Mexican drug cartel by cornering the Albuquerque market with high-quality blue crystal methamphetamine.\n\n - Walt has trouble getting in touch with Jesse and goes to his apartment. Jesse has been staying inside and smoking marijuana since witnessing Spooge's murder. Walt is at first horrified that someone was murdered, but calms down upon learning that nobody can identify Jesse. A call comes in from Badger to set up a deal. Walt is forced to meet Jesse's dealers and learns they are now afraid of Jesse following a rumor that he killed Spooge. Walt uses Jesse's new underworld reputation to galvanize him into helping expand their operation.\n\n - Hank is having trouble fitting in at the DEA office in El Paso, Texas, where his sense of humor is not appreciated and his coworkers do not respect him, partly due to his lack of ability in speaking Spanish. At a meeting with a cartel informant nicknamed \"Tortuga\", Hank loses his patience at the man's demands and his apparent disrespect. Some days later, while waiting for a meeting in the desert, Hank spots a message from the cartels: Tortuga's severed head, mounted on top of a tortoise. Sickened by the grotesque display, Hank moves away from the tortoise. Doing so saves his life when a bomb strapped to the tortoise goes off, killing one agent and wounding three others.\n\n - Due to financial constraints, Skyler goes to her old company to apply for an entry-level job. She meets with her old friend and boss, Ted Beneke, who has taken over the company after his father's death. He decides to give Skyler her old job in the accounting department. Walt is concerned over Skyler's health at the workplace, especially since she originally left due to health problems from the company's manufacturing. There is an obvious sexual tension between Skyler and Beneke; he reveals that he recently separated from his wife, the mother of his two children.\n\n - Jesse sees his landlady, Jane Margolis, drawing on their front steps, and connects with her over their love of art. However, he is identified by a passing motorcyclist who has heard of his reputation, and it is revealed that he lied to her about his name. After he later admits to lying to her, she says that she doesn't care what he does as long as he doesn't do it at the house. He invites her inside to watch TV, even though he can't get his new television working. She holds his hand as they stare at the blank television.\n\n- December 3-5, 2008: Better Call Saul\n\n - After Badger is arrested in a sting operation by the Albuquerque Police, Walt and Jesse look into hiring a shady, flamboyant lawyer named Saul Goodman. Saul has already offered to be Badger's legal counsel and has found out that the DEA is hoping that Badger will lead them to \"Heisenberg.\" Walt poses as Badger's uncle and goes to Saul's office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to flip to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from confessing, but Saul refuses.\n\n - Walt and Jesse resort to kidnapping Saul, threatening to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing on them. However, Saul sees through their scare tactics and instead asks for payment so he can legally represent them, and keep their talks confidential. Saul tells the duo about a man, Jimmy \"In-'N-Out\" Kilkelly, who makes a living being paid by other criminals to go to jail, and offers to have him stand in for Heisenberg. The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger gives them a fake deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school, telling him that he is too easy to find. Saul offers to be Walt's full-time legal counsel and adviser in covering his tracks.\n\n - Skyler goes to work on a Saturday, and Walt notices that she is dressing especially well for her job with Ted. Seeing that Hank has holed himself in his house, Walt gives him a motivational speech, talking about how he has not had any fear in his life since he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. This helps Hank leave the house, but he still has panic attacks. Meanwhile, Jesse has slept with Jane and learns she is in recovery from addiction. Later, after Jesse orders a mattress for his apartment, he and Jane have sex once again.\n\n- December 6-12, 2008: Four Days Out\n\n - Walt arrives at the hospital with his family for a CT scan to learn how he has reacted to chemotherapy. He is told that the results of the test will not be ready for a week, but sees a scan of his lungs and notices a prominent growth. Believing that he has little time left, and realizing that recent expenses and Saul Goodman's fees for laundering his money leave him with little to give his family, Walt decides to spend several days doing nothing but cooking meth. Walt makes up a story about visiting his mother for an extended weekend to be able to explain his absence to Skyler. He convinces Jesse to help for the weekend; Jesse is initially reluctant but cancels his plans to go on a date in Santa Fe with Jane when Walt claims they need to use as much of their supply of methylamine as possible before it goes bad.\n\n - After Jesse collects the additional supplies and picks Walter up from the airport, they drive the RV out to the desert to cook. Walt tells Jesse to leave the keys in a safe spot, and Jesse leaves them in the ignition switch, unaware that it is draining the vehicle's battery. After a few days of cooking, Walt estimates they have nearly $1.2 million in meth. With their portable generator out of gasoline, Walt wants to get more gasoline and get right back to work, but Jesse convinces him they should take a break to find a hotel for the night. When they go to start the RV, they find the battery dead. They attempt to siphon off gasoline from the RV to the generator to jump start the vehicle, but gas spilled in the process causes the generator to catch fire, and Jesse uses all of their drinking water to douse it.\n\n - Jesse suggests they call Skinny Pete for help using Walt's cell phone; despite knowing that Skyler will likely discover this in his cell phone records, Walt allows Jesse to make the call. Jesse tries to give directions to Skinny Pete, but they are unsure if he got them all. When Skinny Pete does not arrive, they call him again, and discover he is far off the directions before the phone dies.\n\n - Walter tears down the generator to allow him to try to trickle charge the RV's battery by manually turning the generator's crank. Though this briefly enables the engine to turn over, the battery quickly dies. Walt becomes depressed and starts suffering from heat exhaustion. Jesse realizes that Walt believes he is going to die, evidenced later when Walt coughs up blood. Walt believes he deserves to die as he has constantly lied to his family. Jesse tries to cheer Walt from his slump, and this inspires Walt to construct their own battery from the materials they have on hand. The makeshift battery provides enough power to jump-start the RV, and they are able to return to Albuquerque. \n\n - Walter and Jesse have breakfast, estimating they will make more than $1 million, Walter laments having waited his entire life to do something special and says Jesse is lucky because he will not have to wait. Jesse drops Walt at the airport, assuring Walt that if Walt dies, his family will get their share of the money.\n\n - Walt and his family return to the doctor the next week, and learn that Walt's cancer is in remission; the \"growth\" Walt spotted was simply inflamed tissue in his lung, and a resulting tear in his esophagus caused him to cough up blood, but will heal in time. Walt's family is ecstatic, but Walt, privately, has a violent outburst realizing that death will not put an end to his web of lies or his drug dealing.\n\n - Approximate: Methamphetamine manufacturer Gale Boetticher excitedly sets up equipment in an underground meth superlab for drug kingpin Gus Fring. Gale asks Gus about the blue meth being produced by chemist Walter White, who is not yet working for Gus. Gus explains he has reservations about hiring Walter, but Gale insists Gus hire him because of his superior product.\n\n- December 13-18, 2008: Over\n\n - Following his discovery that he is in remission, Walt takes Skyler's advice to take the week off from work, but secretly meets with Jesse. He tells Jesse the good news, and that he is out of the drug trade now that he no longer has to pay for treatment. During Skyler's party celebrating the remission, Walt pours Walt Jr. some tequila that he and Hank are drinking. After Walt keeps pouring, Hank takes the bottle away from him. Walt angrily demands it back, leading to a tense standoff which is broken as Walt Jr. vomits into the pool.\n\n - The next day, Skyler refuses to answer Walt's calls in which he tries to apologize. In order to distract himself, he goes on a home improvement spree, replacing their water heater. At work, Skyler confides in Ted about Walt's condition. When Ted notices that she is purposefully staying late, she breaks down, saying that she doesn't feel optimistic because she knows that Walt still has cancer. Ted understands, having suffered physically while caring for his dying father. They tenderly hold hands. The next day, as Ted is leaving, Skyler creates a distraction in order to spend more time with him.\n\n - At the hardware store, Walt notices the cart of a young man buying materials to make drugs. He offers advice about what ingredients to get, causing the man to run away. Outside in the parking lot, he sees the young man with his partner; Walt orders the two to stay out of his territory. Meanwhile, Jesse clumsily makes breakfast for Jane and tells her they can spend the day together. She admires his drawings of superheroes, which she points out all look like him. They hear knocking on Jane's door, which turns out to be her father, the owner of the property. When Jesse goes outside to speak with him, Jane acts like she does not know him. Later, she tells him she was protecting him from her overbearing father, but Jesse is upset that she does not take their relationship seriously. He smokes meth to comfort himself, but brightens when Jane slides a drawing under his door: a superhero called \"Apology Girl\" that looks like her.\n\n- December 19-27, 2008: Mandala\n\n - Combo is selling drugs on a corner when he notices two rival dealers staring him down; he is then killed by a young boy working for them. Skinny Pete, spooked by Combo’s death and Badger's recent brush with the law, decides to quit the drug trade. Walt and Jesse meet with Saul to discuss their next move; he tells them that they are incompetent distributors, and need a businessman who is more restrained than Tuco and will buy their product in bulk. He offers to reach out to the only distributor of that kind he has heard of, but it will be difficult, as the man is extremely cautious. Jesse is distraught that he got Combo killed, and that night tells Jane to leave his apartment so that he does not harm her recovery when he smokes meth. Jane reluctantly decides to stay with him.\n\n - The next day, Walt waits at a local chicken restaurant called Los Pollos Hermanos, where the distributor has arranged to meet them; Jesse comes in late, still high, and leaves quickly afterwards. Nobody talks to Walt, but he realizes later that the distributor saw him and has refused to work with him. Meanwhile, Jane relapses into drug addiction and introduces Jesse to heroin. The next day, Walt goes back to the same restaurant and waits until closing. He eventually realizes that the man he assumes is the restaurant manager is in fact the distributor, and asks for a meeting. The manager eventually reveals that he is the distributor, and that he cannot work with a drug addict like Jesse. Walt assures him that his product is the best there is, and that he only uses Jesse because he can count on his complete obedience. The manager assures Walt that he will be in touch if he decides to work with the duo, and warns Walt never to trust a drug addict.\n\n - Approximate: Jesse and Jane Margolis visit the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum and view her painting My Last Door. The two debate the meaning of the painting before Jane concludes that O'Keeffe was simply trying to make a good feeling last.\n\n - Skyler helps the company celebrate her boss Ted's birthday, where she sings him a sultry version of \"Happy Birthday to You\" reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe's \"Happy Birthday, Mr. President\". She later finds, while investigating the accounts, that there are many inaccuracies in the payments to the company. Ted admits that he has evaded taxation on millions of dollars by under-reporting revenue to keep the company afloat and support its employees. Skyler says she will not turn him in, but cannot be a part of his illegal doings; however, she later comes back to work. Walt gets a message telling him to come to the restaurant, where he learns from the actual manager that the man he met is the owner of several stores, and that his name is Gus Fring. Just as Walt is about to leave, an associate of Gus named Victor blocks him from exiting and tells him to deliver the meth to a truck stop within the next hour in exchange for $1.2 Million cash. Walt rushes to Jesse's apartment and breaks in while Jesse and Jane are in a heroin-induced haze. At the same time, Skyler goes into labor and tries to contact Walt. Walt is tortured about his choice, but decides to go do the transaction anyway.\n\n- December 27, 2008: Holly born\n\n- December 28-31, 2008: Phoenix\n\n - Walt barely delivers the inventory of drugs to Gus in time, but misses his daughter's birth. He arrives at the hospital, where he finds that Ted drove Skyler to the hospital. At Jesse's apartment, Jane wakes up when she is phoned by her father, Donald, because she is late for a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. At lunch afterwards, she does not mention that she has started using heroin again, and acts as though she does not know Jesse when her father asks about him. Jesse, seeing the aftermath of Walt's search, initially believes he was robbed, but then listens to the phone messages Walt left. Jesse shows up at Walt's classroom to ask for his share of the money, which Walt refuses because he believes it will further Jesse’s addiction. He promises to pay Jesse when he knows that Jesse and Jane are clean.\n\n**2009**\n\n- Approximate: Leonel and Marco Salamanca are 32 years old\n\n- January 1-26, 2009: Phoenix\n\n - Jesse and Jane inject heroin in his apartment. As he passes out, Jesse complains about Walt holding out on him, telling Jane that he is owed $480,000. Donald calls Jane again when she is late to another rehab meeting; unbeknownst to Jane, he is waiting directly outside. Seeing her emerging from Jesse's door, he barges in and finds evidence of them both using heroin. He is furious that she has relapsed and calls the police, but Jane promises she will enter rehab the next day. He relents and gives her another chance. Meanwhile, Walt Jr. has put up a website so that people can donate to Walt's cancer surgery. Walt does not want to accept charity, especially because he earned the money to pay for his treatment, but cannot reveal its source to his family. Saul tells him that he will contact a hacker to make the money look like it is coming from computers all over the world, and avert suspicions by putting in small amounts.\n\n - Jane calls Walt to blackmail him into giving Jesse his share. Walt delivers the money to Jesse and Jane, who are ecstatic and talk of getting clean, but still feel a strong pull to use their remaining heroin. Walt goes to a bar to unwind, where he unknowingly sits next to Donald. The two start talking about the Phoenix probe's discovery of water on Mars and about Donald's daughter and Walt's \"nephew,\" voicing their frustrations over trying to help people who will not do what is good for them. Donald opines that one can never give up on one’s family. Motivated by Donald's words, Walt goes back to Jesse's house to talk to him, but finds Jesse and Jane passed out from heroin use. While Walt is trying to wake Jesse, he inadvertently knocks Jane onto her back; she starts to choke on her own vomit. Walt rushes to help, but then lets her die while Jesse lies passed out next to her. Before leaving the building, Walt begins to cry.\n\n- January 27 - February 12, 2009: ABQ\n\n - Jesse wakes from his heroin-induced sleep to find Jane Margolis dead, having choked on her own vomit.

Saul sends Mike Ehrmantraut, a cleaner, to remove all evidence of drugs from Jesse's apartment and to coach him on how to interact with authorities. Jane's father Donald arrives at the apartment to find that his daughter has died, with Jesse being interviewed by the medical examiner. Jesse is unable to look Donald in the eyes, and, believing himself to be responsible for Jane's death, runs off to a crack house. Walt locates Jesse and takes him to rehab.\n\n - Meanwhile, Walt is preparing to undergo surgery to remove his cancer. The website that Walt Jr. made to bring in anonymous donations—in reality being used by Saul to launder Walt's drug money—has gained media attention due to its apparent success; Walt is uncomfortable in the spotlight. On the day of Walt's operation, as he is put under anesthetics, he accidentally reveals the existence of a second cell phone he uses, making Skyler White suspicious of his activities again.\n\n- February 13: Kim's 41st birthday\n\n- February 14 - February 17, 2009: ABQ\n\n - Six weeks later, after Walt is released from the hospital, Skyler reveals to him that she has investigated his behavior of the past several months and found out he has lied to her many times. Walt offers to tell her everything if she stays, but she is too afraid to know and decides to leave him. By this time, Donald has returned to work as an air traffic controller. While on the job, his mind wanders back to Jane's death; in his emotional state, he inadvertently allows the flight paths of two commercial airliners to cross over Albuquerque.\n\n - Walt is sitting beside his swimming pool when he is startled by an explosion overhead.

Walt also demands no further bloodshed. Meanwhile, as Walt&amp;#39;s chemotherapy continues, he tells Skyler that Elliott&amp;#39;s check came and he deposited it, when in fact he is struggling to pay for the treatment and plans on using his meth profits to cover it. At a family therapy session, Skyler tells Walt that she is concerned about his missing hours, but he explains that he just likes to be alone sometimes and take walks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;While cooking meth, Jesse observes a radiotherapy burn on Walt&amp;#39;s chest and realizes he is trying to take care of his family before he dies of lung cancer. Jesse finishes their current batch and spends all night selling it, bringing Walt his share of $1,300, far less than he expected. Jesse explains they need a distributor if they want to make more money; after Krazy-8&amp;#39;s death, Tuco Salamanca has taken over his territory. Jesse gains a meeting with Tuco after getting his friend Skinny Pete, who served time in prison alongside Tuco, to vouch for him. Though Tuco is willing to pay $35,000 for a pound of meth, he insists on paying only after his dealers have completed the sales. When Jesse refuses, Tuco severely beats him and lands him in the hospital.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Hank traces the gas mask found in the desert to Walt&amp;#39;s high school. Hank and Walt take inventory of the chemistry lab to find other equipment missing, leading Hank to suspect that a student obtained a key to the lab storage room. Later, Hank arrests a school janitor named Hugo, who would have had the keys and had a previous record for drug possession. Walt feels guilty letting Hugo take the fall and tries to contact Jesse, only to learn about his hospitalization. He visits Jesse and learns what happened with Tuco.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Now starting to lose his hair from the chemo, Walt decides to shave off what remaining hair he has left. Afterwards, he arranges for a meeting with Tuco under the name &amp;quot;Heisenberg,&amp;quot; demanding $50,000 from Tuco—$35,000 for the meth Tuco took from Jesse, and $15,000 for pain and suffering for Jesse&amp;#39;s treatment. Seeing Walt with another bag of material, Tuco calls his bluff and threatens Walt. Walt throws a piece of the material against the floor which explodes. The entire floor is shaken, blowing out the windows and knocking everyone in the room off their feet. Walt reveals that the bag contains fulminated mercury. Walt threatens to smash the entire bag to the ground. Tuco submits and agrees to the payment as well as agreeing to a purchase for the next week, offering Walter $35,000 for the next pound of meth. Walt demands instead that Tuco buy two pounds of meth a week for $70,000. Tuco, incredulous, agrees. Walt leaves the building. Once back in his car, Walt exhibits an intense rush from what he has just done.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;October 25-31, 2008: A No Rough Stuff Type Deal&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At a high school PTA meeting, Walt fondles Skyler beneath the conference room table, arousing her. In the parking lot, the two of them have sex in the back of Walt&amp;#39;s car – Walt is beginning to get off on the danger of his situation. Jesse, who is now living in the RV, puts his house on the market because he is too traumatized by the deaths of Krazy-8 and Emilio to continue living there. Walt tells him about the deal with Tuco, but Jesse says producing two pounds of meth a week is impossible. His &amp;quot;smurfs&amp;quot; – people who supply him the pseudoephedrine needed to cook the meth – can only supply so much a week.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt and Jesse meet Tuco and his men at a junkyard, where they hand him approximately half a pound of meth. Tuco is furious that Walt&amp;#39;s end of the bargain was not kept and pays him only $17,000. He gives Walt another chance next week, but Walt says he still wants the $70,000 Tuco promised upfront, despite not having the goods. Tuco agrees to $52,500, which adds up to $65,625, but threatens dire consequences if next week&amp;#39;s quota is not met. To make up for it, Walt promises to have four pounds of meth at the next meeting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At Skyler&amp;#39;s baby shower, Marie presents her with an expensive white gold baby&amp;#39;s tiara. This seems to irritate Hank. In the yard, Walt and Hank have a philosophical conversation about the dividing line between legal and illegal behavior. That night, Walt tells Skyler that he is planning to spend a weekend at a holistic medical clinic after she expressed desire for alternative therapy. In reality, Walt is cooking meth with Jesse. Skyler goes to return the tiara and is detained in the store – it turns out that Marie stole it, but Skyler matches her description. She pretends to go into labor, persuading them to let her go. Skyler later confronts Marie about the theft, but Marie calmly denies it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt has a plan to manufacture the meth using different precursors, and gives Jesse a list of chemicals and equipment to acquire with the cash fronted by Tuco. Jesse gets almost everything Walt requested except methylamine, which is kept tightly controlled. Jesse knows of a chemical warehouse where there are men willing to steal and sell the methylamine for $10,000. Walt decides they will steal the methylamine themselves by using the aluminum powder in Etch-a-Sketches to make thermite. At night, Walt and Jesse trespass into the warehouse, subdue a security guard by locking him in a portable toilet, and place the thermite on a locked door, which melts the metal when lit. The two steal a 40 gallon drum of methylamine and escape.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The next day, Walt and Jesse attempt to start the RV when mechanical troubles prevent it from going anywhere. Faced with a deadline, they set up to cook in Jesse&amp;#39;s basement, unaware that his realtor has planned an open house viewing for that afternoon. Jesse guards the door to the basement while Walt synthesizes the chemicals, and once a man asks to see the basement, Jesse demands that everyone leave. When Walt arrives back home, he learns of Marie&amp;#39;s theft and wonders if Skyler would ever turn him in for a crime. At the next meeting with Tuco, Walt supplies 4.6 pounds of meth. Despite its blue hue, it is still the same quality and Tuco hands over $91,000. When one of Tuco&amp;#39;s men makes an offhanded remark to Walt, Tuco becomes furious and beats the man with his fists until he is unconscious. As Tuco drives away, Walt and Jesse look at each other in shock.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;October 31 - November 7, 2008: Seven Thirty-Seven&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the junkyard, after his purchase of meth from Walter White and Jesse, drug kingpin Tuco Salamanca viciously assaults his lieutenant, No-Doze, after he speaks to Walt in Tuco’s place. After Tuco departs, Walt calculates the amount of money he will need to provide for his family, concluding that the figure is $737,000. Tuco suddenly returns demanding that Walt save an unresponsive No-Doze. After he dies, Gonzo, the other man in Tuco’s employ, states that they should move the body, but Tuco refuses and leaves it in the junkyard.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt parts ways with Jesse and goes home. Skyler White finds him standing at the television, and he subsequently forces himself on her. After she makes him stop, Walt sits by the pool and is later found by Walter Jr. Meanwhile, Jesse acquires a firearm at a hot dog restaurant. The next day, he tells Walt that he believes Tuco poses a threat that must be taken care of. Walt points out that shooting him would end badly, and the pair seems despondent. Elsewhere, Skyler refuses to answer phone calls from her sister, Marie Schrader. Marie and her husband Hank argue about whether or not she attempted to schedule a dinner with Skyler in a way that conflicts with another appointment that she has for therapy, revealing that Marie reluctantly goes to therapy for unspecified problems.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At the DEA field office, Hank&amp;#39;s partner Steven Gomez shows him footage of Walt and Jesse&amp;#39;s methylamine robbery. Hank dismisses their ability as thieves, but is intrigued by the fact that the unknown pair stole methylamine and used thermite to enter the warehouse. Gomez speculates they may be college-aged chemistry students, and Hank hints that the two will encounter difficulty from the drug cartels for disrupting the meth trade. Walt becomes worried when he notices an SUV parked near his house and spends the night watching the street. Jesse encourages Walt to also purchase a gun, hoping to &amp;quot;double their chances&amp;quot; of success in the event of a shooting. Instead, Walt proposes that they kill Tuco in a more clandestine way, using ricin made from castor beans. Hank visits Skyler and asks her to make up with Marie. Skyler responds angrily, stating that her situation is worse than her sister’s. Hank and Skyler both realize that the other knows about Marie&amp;#39;s shoplifting.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt and Jesse produce the ricin, hoping to trick Tuco into poisoning himself by placing it in the next meth delivery. As they finish their work, Walt receives a phone call from Hank, who is at a crime scene. Hank says that he screwed up in speaking to Skyler, and Walt forgives him. It is revealed that the crime scene Hank is investigating is the junkyard, and that Gonzo has accidentally died in a botched attempt to move No-Doze&amp;#39;s body. Walt and Jesse infer that Tuco killed Gonzo, and Walt insists that Jesse leave town. Walt returns home, where he avoids answering questions from Skyler. He receives a phone call and goes outside, where Jesse is being held at gunpoint in his car by Tuco. Tuco forces Walt to enter the car.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 8, 2008: Grilled&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Having been kidnapped by a crazed Tuco, Walt and Jesse are held prisoner in a desert hideout where he takes care of his sick uncle, the mute Hector Salamanca. Hector is incapacitated from the neck down and unable to speak, but can communicate with a desk bell attached to his wheelchair. Hank and the DEA have rounded up Tuco&amp;#39;s entire organization, and Tuco thinks that one of his associates ratted him out. He intends to keep Walt and Jesse in the compound until his cousins take them all across the border to Mexico.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hank, meanwhile, takes a bit of time off to look for Walt. Skyler is sick with worry and has been distributing handbills with Walt&amp;#39;s photo. Hank remembers that Jesse was Walt&amp;#39;s source of marijuana and tries to track him down. Walt tries unsuccessfully to poison a burrito Tuco prepares with the ricin he has prepared; Hector thwarts the attempt, prompting Tuco to lash out at Walt and Jesse. Tuco takes them outside and plans to kill them. Walt and Jesse manage to wound Tuco and escape. Hank shows up looking for Jesse, and is confronted by a wounded Tuco. A brief firefight ensues; Hank shoots and kills Tuco. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 8-11, 2008: Bit by a Dead Bee&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Having gotten away from Tuco, Walt and Jesse now have to get home and explain where they have been. Walt has a plan for both of them and they split up. Walt goes to a supermarket and takes off all of his clothes while walking around the aisles. He is hospitalized and claims to have no memory of where he has been for the last few days. The hospital is unable to find anything wrong with him, and Walt suggests that it was a combination of medication and chemotherapy that could have caused the episode. The hospital believes Walt is at risk for another fugue state and forces him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. Walt admits to the psychiatrist after receiving assurances regarding patient confidentiality that he remembers everything and just wanted to get away for a while. They eventually agree to release him.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse returns to his house to clean out the basement and get rid of the RV where he and Walt have been making methamphetamine. When the DEA agents track him down, he claims that he has been with a prostitute, Wendy, for the weekend. The DEA does not believe him and bring in Tuco&amp;#39;s uncle Hector to identify him, but Hector refuses to cooperate with the authorities. They have to let Jesse go. Jesse tries to contact his parents, but they refuse to help him. That night, Walt convinces Jesse to continue cooking meth. Later, Hank gets a present at the station: Tuco&amp;#39;s teeth grill encased in a clear acrylic cube.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 12, 2008: Jimmy/Saul&amp;#39;s 48th birthday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 12-17, 2008: Down&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt and Jesse meet at a gas station to discuss their next move. Walt says he needs time to reassure his family after his &amp;quot;fugue state&amp;quot; before he can cook again, and gives Jesse $600. The next morning, Walt cheerily makes breakfast, clearly disturbing Skyler and Walt Jr.; Skyler abruptly leaves the house and does not return until much later, not telling Walt where she has been. Meanwhile, Jesse meets with an attorney and his parents, who tell him that they found the meth lab in his basement and are evicting him from his aunt&amp;#39;s house. They tell him he has 72 hours to leave, but the next morning Jesse&amp;#39;s mother arrives with workmen who take everything in the house to storage. Jesse at first tries to convince his mother that he can change, then angrily tells her that he earned the house by taking care of his cancer-stricken aunt while his mother did nothing. She loses her temper and slaps him.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hoping to reconnect with his son, Walt offers to give Walt Jr. a driving lesson while Skyler is out again. Walt Jr. shows his skill at driving, but Walt notices that he is using both feet to work the pedals. When Walt tries to get him to only use the right foot, Walt Jr. gets upset and accidentally hits a safety cone. Jesse searches for a place to stay, but all of his friends turn him away. While Jesse is making a call at the gas station, his motorcycle and all his remaining possessions are stolen. Dejected, Jesse breaks into the lot where his RV is being kept, but accidentally falls through a Port-a-Potty, drenching himself in waste. He sleeps in his RV, only able to breathe through a gas mask. The next morning, Clovis, the lot owner, finds him and demands the money he is owed, plus extra for repairs to the RV and the Port-a-Potty. Having no cash, Jesse begs for time to pay him back, but Clovis kicks him out and plans to sell his meth-cooking equipment. Jesse breaks back into the lot, steals his RV, and escapes by driving through the locked gate.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;While Walt Jr. is at school, Walt tries to have a conversation with Skyler. He apologizes for how he has been acting lately, but Skyler is still convinced he is hiding something and storms out when he won&amp;#39;t tell her what it is. Walt follows her out and sees the RV parked near his house. He confronts Jesse over making contact, and Jesse tells him he only wants his half of the money they&amp;#39;ve made and will disappear. Walt angrily states that he has done all the work while Jesse has done nothing, ranting that Jesse is a &amp;quot;pathetic junkie&amp;quot; who is too stupid to follow simple instructions. This causes Jesse to lose his temper and attack him, but he stops himself from beating Walt. Walt brings Jesse inside and gives him his half of the earnings, and then offers him breakfast. Meanwhile, back at the gas station, Skyler gets into her car and takes out a cigarette and lighter. She hesitates, thinking about her pregnancy, but starts smoking.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 18-29, 2008: Breakage&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt finishes his first round of chemotherapy and is told he will learn the results in two months&amp;#39; time, around when his baby is due. However, Walt begins to feel overwhelmed by the growing medical bills, and the money he made from Tuco is running out. While he is vomiting into the toilet, he finds something clogging it - the packet of cigarettes Skyler was smoking.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse returns to Clovis to make good on his word: he pays for the towing and repair of his gate. He also works out a deal to store his RV in Clovis&amp;#39; lot, and buys a used car from him. Next, he rents an apartment from Jane Margolis, who manages the property and lives next door. Although he likes the space, he has no credit history and can only pay in cash. She initially refuses to rent to him, but eventually agrees after raising the price for cash only.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hank is promoted to a high-ranking Albuquerque liaison for the DEA, and will have to split his time between the city and El Paso, Texas. He goes out to celebrate with his friends, but has a panic attack on the elevator ride down. The next day, he takes off work to bottle some of the beer he has brewed at home. Marie is confused at this behavior, but he assures her everything is all right. After she leaves, a bottle breaks during capping, cutting his hand.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Walt and Jesse meet again to discuss how to distribute their meth. Jesse does not want to work on his own now that the DEA have found him, and suggests building a network of dealers so that they can be both distributors and producers. Walt is initially reluctant, but Jesse threatens to walk if they don&amp;#39;t follow his plan. Later, Jesse invites his friends Combo, Skinny Pete, and Badger to his apartment, and discusses using them as dealers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At a cookout celebrating Hank&amp;#39;s promotion, Skyler demands that Marie apologize for giving Skyler the stolen tiara, or it will irreversibly drive a wedge between them; Marie tearfully does so.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse&amp;#39;s dealers are doing well selling their meth, until Skinny Pete is robbed by one of his customers. When Jesse gives Walt his share, minus the stolen money, he explains that it is breakage—revenue loss from damaged, lost, or stolen goods—that must be expected as the cost of doing business. Walt, however, worries what will happen when word gets out that they can be robbed with impunity. He later shows up at Jesse&amp;#39;s apartment and gives him a gun, telling him to take care of the problem.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;He also confronts Skyler over her smoking, but she refuses to apologize for keeping secrets when he has been doing the same. That night, Hank is woken by what he thinks are gunshots, and goes through the house with his pistol drawn. It turns out to be caps popping off beer bottles due to pressure. The next day, he drives down to the Rio Grande and throws his trophy of Tuco&amp;#39;s grill into the river.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;November 30, 2008: Peekaboo&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse gets the address of the couple who ripped off Skinny Pete and goes to their dilapidated house. Upon breaking inside, he finds and tends to their young neglected son. When the couple returns home, Jesse holds them up and demands that they return his meth and his money. They give him part of the meth, claiming to have lost the other portion, and show him an ATM they have stolen from a convenience store. The husband, Spooge, works unsuccessfully to open the ATM. While Jesse is busy playing with the son, the wife knocks him unconscious, stealing his gun and drugs. Jesse wakes up to see Spooge trying to open the ATM from the bottom. His wife, angry that he keeps calling her a &amp;quot;skank&amp;quot;, knocks the ATM over, crushing him; she then takes his drugs and gets high on the couch. Jesse hurriedly takes back the gun, takes what money he can when the ATM pops open, and calls 9-1-1. He then brings the boy out of the house, tells him not to go back inside, and runs away.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;On his first day back teaching after finishing chemotherapy, Walt teaches his class about Dr. Tracy Hall, the inventor of synthetic diamonds, who earned only a pittance for his invention while General Electric made an incalculable profit. At home, Skyler gets a call from Gretchen Schwartz, whom she still believes is paying Walt&amp;#39;s medical bills. Skyler invites Gretchen over that afternoon, but Gretchen quickly leaves when Walt arrives home. Walt asks Gretchen if Skyler told her anything; she does not answer. Walt then drives up to Santa Fe to apologize to Gretchen for lying, but Gretchen demands to know why Walt did it and how he has been paying for his treatment. Walt, angry at being cut out of Gray Matter Technologies, denies her any right to that information; Gretchen insists that Walt was the one who left by walking out of their past relationship. Walt curses at her. When Walt gets back home, Skyler tells him that Gretchen called to say that the Schwartzes will no longer be paying for Walt&amp;#39;s treatment. Realizing his cover has now been blown, Walt claims that the Schwartzes have gone broke, but promises that he and Skyler will be able to find the necessary money.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 1-2, 2008: Negro y Azul&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The episode opens with the narcocorrido band Los Cuates de Sinaloa performing &amp;quot;Negro y Azul&amp;quot; (&amp;quot;Black and Blue&amp;quot;), which is about how &amp;quot;a gringo boss&amp;quot; named Heisenberg is disrespecting the Mexican drug cartel by cornering the Albuquerque market with high-quality blue crystal methamphetamine.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt has trouble getting in touch with Jesse and goes to his apartment. Jesse has been staying inside and smoking marijuana since witnessing Spooge&amp;#39;s murder. Walt is at first horrified that someone was murdered, but calms down upon learning that nobody can identify Jesse. A call comes in from Badger to set up a deal. Walt is forced to meet Jesse&amp;#39;s dealers and learns they are now afraid of Jesse following a rumor that he killed Spooge. Walt uses Jesse&amp;#39;s new underworld reputation to galvanize him into helping expand their operation.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hank is having trouble fitting in at the DEA office in El Paso, Texas, where his sense of humor is not appreciated and his coworkers do not respect him, partly due to his lack of ability in speaking Spanish. At a meeting with a cartel informant nicknamed &amp;quot;Tortuga&amp;quot;, Hank loses his patience at the man&amp;#39;s demands and his apparent disrespect. Some days later, while waiting for a meeting in the desert, Hank spots a message from the cartels: Tortuga&amp;#39;s severed head, mounted on top of a tortoise. Sickened by the grotesque display, Hank moves away from the tortoise. Doing so saves his life when a bomb strapped to the tortoise goes off, killing one agent and wounding three others.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Due to financial constraints, Skyler goes to her old company to apply for an entry-level job. She meets with her old friend and boss, Ted Beneke, who has taken over the company after his father&amp;#39;s death. He decides to give Skyler her old job in the accounting department. Walt is concerned over Skyler&amp;#39;s health at the workplace, especially since she originally left due to health problems from the company&amp;#39;s manufacturing. There is an obvious sexual tension between Skyler and Beneke; he reveals that he recently separated from his wife, the mother of his two children.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse sees his landlady, Jane Margolis, drawing on their front steps, and connects with her over their love of art. However, he is identified by a passing motorcyclist who has heard of his reputation, and it is revealed that he lied to her about his name. After he later admits to lying to her, she says that she doesn&amp;#39;t care what he does as long as he doesn&amp;#39;t do it at the house. He invites her inside to watch TV, even though he can&amp;#39;t get his new television working. She holds his hand as they stare at the blank television.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 3-5, 2008: Better Call Saul&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After Badger is arrested in a sting operation by the Albuquerque Police, Walt and Jesse look into hiring a shady, flamboyant lawyer named Saul Goodman. Saul has already offered to be Badger&amp;#39;s legal counsel and has found out that the DEA is hoping that Badger will lead them to &amp;quot;Heisenberg.&amp;quot; Walt poses as Badger&amp;#39;s uncle and goes to Saul&amp;#39;s office, where he learns that Saul will advise Badger to flip to avoid prison. Walt offers Saul a bribe to keep Badger from confessing, but Saul refuses.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt and Jesse resort to kidnapping Saul, threatening to kill him if he does not keep Badger from informing on them. However, Saul sees through their scare tactics and instead asks for payment so he can legally represent them, and keep their talks confidential. Saul tells the duo about a man, Jimmy &amp;quot;In-&amp;#39;N-Out&amp;quot; Kilkelly, who makes a living being paid by other criminals to go to jail, and offers to have him stand in for Heisenberg. The DEA busts Kilkelly when Badger gives them a fake deal, but Hank is not completely convinced. Later, Saul visits Walt at his school, telling him that he is too easy to find. Saul offers to be Walt&amp;#39;s full-time legal counsel and adviser in covering his tracks.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Skyler goes to work on a Saturday, and Walt notices that she is dressing especially well for her job with Ted. Seeing that Hank has holed himself in his house, Walt gives him a motivational speech, talking about how he has not had any fear in his life since he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. This helps Hank leave the house, but he still has panic attacks. Meanwhile, Jesse has slept with Jane and learns she is in recovery from addiction. Later, after Jesse orders a mattress for his apartment, he and Jane have sex once again.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 6-12, 2008: Four Days Out&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt arrives at the hospital with his family for a CT scan to learn how he has reacted to chemotherapy. He is told that the results of the test will not be ready for a week, but sees a scan of his lungs and notices a prominent growth. Believing that he has little time left, and realizing that recent expenses and Saul Goodman&amp;#39;s fees for laundering his money leave him with little to give his family, Walt decides to spend several days doing nothing but cooking meth. Walt makes up a story about visiting his mother for an extended weekend to be able to explain his absence to Skyler. He convinces Jesse to help for the weekend; Jesse is initially reluctant but cancels his plans to go on a date in Santa Fe with Jane when Walt claims they need to use as much of their supply of methylamine as possible before it goes bad.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;After Jesse collects the additional supplies and picks Walter up from the airport, they drive the RV out to the desert to cook. Walt tells Jesse to leave the keys in a safe spot, and Jesse leaves them in the ignition switch, unaware that it is draining the vehicle&amp;#39;s battery. After a few days of cooking, Walt estimates they have nearly $1.2 million in meth. With their portable generator out of gasoline, Walt wants to get more gasoline and get right back to work, but Jesse convinces him they should take a break to find a hotel for the night. When they go to start the RV, they find the battery dead. They attempt to siphon off gasoline from the RV to the generator to jump start the vehicle, but gas spilled in the process causes the generator to catch fire, and Jesse uses all of their drinking water to douse it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse suggests they call Skinny Pete for help using Walt&amp;#39;s cell phone; despite knowing that Skyler will likely discover this in his cell phone records, Walt allows Jesse to make the call. Jesse tries to give directions to Skinny Pete, but they are unsure if he got them all. When Skinny Pete does not arrive, they call him again, and discover he is far off the directions before the phone dies.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walter tears down the generator to allow him to try to trickle charge the RV&amp;#39;s battery by manually turning the generator&amp;#39;s crank. Though this briefly enables the engine to turn over, the battery quickly dies. Walt becomes depressed and starts suffering from heat exhaustion. Jesse realizes that Walt believes he is going to die, evidenced later when Walt coughs up blood. Walt believes he deserves to die as he has constantly lied to his family. Jesse tries to cheer Walt from his slump, and this inspires Walt to construct their own battery from the materials they have on hand. The makeshift battery provides enough power to jump-start the RV, and they are able to return to Albuquerque. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walter and Jesse have breakfast, estimating they will make more than $1 million, Walter laments having waited his entire life to do something special and says Jesse is lucky because he will not have to wait. Jesse drops Walt at the airport, assuring Walt that if Walt dies, his family will get their share of the money.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt and his family return to the doctor the next week, and learn that Walt&amp;#39;s cancer is in remission; the &amp;quot;growth&amp;quot; Walt spotted was simply inflamed tissue in his lung, and a resulting tear in his esophagus caused him to cough up blood, but will heal in time. Walt&amp;#39;s family is ecstatic, but Walt, privately, has a violent outburst realizing that death will not put an end to his web of lies or his drug dealing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Approximate: Methamphetamine manufacturer Gale Boetticher excitedly sets up equipment in an underground meth superlab for drug kingpin Gus Fring. Gale asks Gus about the blue meth being produced by chemist Walter White, who is not yet working for Gus. Gus explains he has reservations about hiring Walter, but Gale insists Gus hire him because of his superior product.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 13-18, 2008: Over&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Following his discovery that he is in remission, Walt takes Skyler&amp;#39;s advice to take the week off from work, but secretly meets with Jesse. He tells Jesse the good news, and that he is out of the drug trade now that he no longer has to pay for treatment. During Skyler&amp;#39;s party celebrating the remission, Walt pours Walt Jr. some tequila that he and Hank are drinking. After Walt keeps pouring, Hank takes the bottle away from him. Walt angrily demands it back, leading to a tense standoff which is broken as Walt Jr. vomits into the pool.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The next day, Skyler refuses to answer Walt&amp;#39;s calls in which he tries to apologize. In order to distract himself, he goes on a home improvement spree, replacing their water heater. At work, Skyler confides in Ted about Walt&amp;#39;s condition. When Ted notices that she is purposefully staying late, she breaks down, saying that she doesn&amp;#39;t feel optimistic because she knows that Walt still has cancer. Ted understands, having suffered physically while caring for his dying father. They tenderly hold hands. The next day, as Ted is leaving, Skyler creates a distraction in order to spend more time with him.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At the hardware store, Walt notices the cart of a young man buying materials to make drugs. He offers advice about what ingredients to get, causing the man to run away. Outside in the parking lot, he sees the young man with his partner; Walt orders the two to stay out of his territory. Meanwhile, Jesse clumsily makes breakfast for Jane and tells her they can spend the day together. She admires his drawings of superheroes, which she points out all look like him. They hear knocking on Jane&amp;#39;s door, which turns out to be her father, the owner of the property. When Jesse goes outside to speak with him, Jane acts like she does not know him. Later, she tells him she was protecting him from her overbearing father, but Jesse is upset that she does not take their relationship seriously. He smokes meth to comfort himself, but brightens when Jane slides a drawing under his door: a superhero called &amp;quot;Apology Girl&amp;quot; that looks like her.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 19-27, 2008: Mandala&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Combo is selling drugs on a corner when he notices two rival dealers staring him down; he is then killed by a young boy working for them. Skinny Pete, spooked by Combo’s death and Badger&amp;#39;s recent brush with the law, decides to quit the drug trade. Walt and Jesse meet with Saul to discuss their next move; he tells them that they are incompetent distributors, and need a businessman who is more restrained than Tuco and will buy their product in bulk. He offers to reach out to the only distributor of that kind he has heard of, but it will be difficult, as the man is extremely cautious. Jesse is distraught that he got Combo killed, and that night tells Jane to leave his apartment so that he does not harm her recovery when he smokes meth. Jane reluctantly decides to stay with him.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The next day, Walt waits at a local chicken restaurant called Los Pollos Hermanos, where the distributor has arranged to meet them; Jesse comes in late, still high, and leaves quickly afterwards. Nobody talks to Walt, but he realizes later that the distributor saw him and has refused to work with him. Meanwhile, Jane relapses into drug addiction and introduces Jesse to heroin. The next day, Walt goes back to the same restaurant and waits until closing. He eventually realizes that the man he assumes is the restaurant manager is in fact the distributor, and asks for a meeting. The manager eventually reveals that he is the distributor, and that he cannot work with a drug addict like Jesse. Walt assures him that his product is the best there is, and that he only uses Jesse because he can count on his complete obedience. The manager assures Walt that he will be in touch if he decides to work with the duo, and warns Walt never to trust a drug addict.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Approximate: Jesse and Jane Margolis visit the Georgia O&amp;#39;Keeffe Museum and view her painting My Last Door. The two debate the meaning of the painting before Jane concludes that O&amp;#39;Keeffe was simply trying to make a good feeling last.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Skyler helps the company celebrate her boss Ted&amp;#39;s birthday, where she sings him a sultry version of &amp;quot;Happy Birthday to You&amp;quot; reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Happy Birthday, Mr. President&amp;quot;. She later finds, while investigating the accounts, that there are many inaccuracies in the payments to the company. Ted admits that he has evaded taxation on millions of dollars by under-reporting revenue to keep the company afloat and support its employees. Skyler says she will not turn him in, but cannot be a part of his illegal doings; however, she later comes back to work. Walt gets a message telling him to come to the restaurant, where he learns from the actual manager that the man he met is the owner of several stores, and that his name is Gus Fring. Just as Walt is about to leave, an associate of Gus named Victor blocks him from exiting and tells him to deliver the meth to a truck stop within the next hour in exchange for $1.2 Million cash. Walt rushes to Jesse&amp;#39;s apartment and breaks in while Jesse and Jane are in a heroin-induced haze. At the same time, Skyler goes into labor and tries to contact Walt. Walt is tortured about his choice, but decides to go do the transaction anyway.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 27, 2008: Holly born&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;December 28-31, 2008: Phoenix&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt barely delivers the inventory of drugs to Gus in time, but misses his daughter&amp;#39;s birth. He arrives at the hospital, where he finds that Ted drove Skyler to the hospital. At Jesse&amp;#39;s apartment, Jane wakes up when she is phoned by her father, Donald, because she is late for a Narcotics Anonymous meeting. At lunch afterwards, she does not mention that she has started using heroin again, and acts as though she does not know Jesse when her father asks about him. Jesse, seeing the aftermath of Walt&amp;#39;s search, initially believes he was robbed, but then listens to the phone messages Walt left. Jesse shows up at Walt&amp;#39;s classroom to ask for his share of the money, which Walt refuses because he believes it will further Jesse’s addiction. He promises to pay Jesse when he knows that Jesse and Jane are clean.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approximate: Leonel and Marco Salamanca are 32 years old&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 1-26, 2009: Phoenix&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse and Jane inject heroin in his apartment. As he passes out, Jesse complains about Walt holding out on him, telling Jane that he is owed $480,000. Donald calls Jane again when she is late to another rehab meeting; unbeknownst to Jane, he is waiting directly outside. Seeing her emerging from Jesse&amp;#39;s door, he barges in and finds evidence of them both using heroin. He is furious that she has relapsed and calls the police, but Jane promises she will enter rehab the next day. He relents and gives her another chance. Meanwhile, Walt Jr. has put up a website so that people can donate to Walt&amp;#39;s cancer surgery. Walt does not want to accept charity, especially because he earned the money to pay for his treatment, but cannot reveal its source to his family. Saul tells him that he will contact a hacker to make the money look like it is coming from computers all over the world, and avert suspicions by putting in small amounts.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jane calls Walt to blackmail him into giving Jesse his share. Walt delivers the money to Jesse and Jane, who are ecstatic and talk of getting clean, but still feel a strong pull to use their remaining heroin. Walt goes to a bar to unwind, where he unknowingly sits next to Donald. The two start talking about the Phoenix probe&amp;#39;s discovery of water on Mars and about Donald&amp;#39;s daughter and Walt&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;nephew,&amp;quot; voicing their frustrations over trying to help people who will not do what is good for them. Donald opines that one can never give up on one’s family. Motivated by Donald&amp;#39;s words, Walt goes back to Jesse&amp;#39;s house to talk to him, but finds Jesse and Jane passed out from heroin use. While Walt is trying to wake Jesse, he inadvertently knocks Jane onto her back; she starts to choke on her own vomit. Walt rushes to help, but then lets her die while Jesse lies passed out next to her. Before leaving the building, Walt begins to cry.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 27 - February 12, 2009: ABQ&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jesse wakes from his heroin-induced sleep to find Jane Margolis dead, having choked on her own vomit. After a frenzied attempt at CPR, Jesse contacts Walter White for help. Feigning ignorance of Jane&amp;#39;s death, Walt calls Saul Goodman. Saul sends Mike Ehrmantraut, a cleaner, to remove all evidence of drugs from Jesse&amp;#39;s apartment and to coach him on how to interact with authorities. Jane&amp;#39;s father Donald arrives at the apartment to find that his daughter has died, with Jesse being interviewed by the medical examiner. Jesse is unable to look Donald in the eyes, and, believing himself to be responsible for Jane&amp;#39;s death, runs off to a crack house. Walt locates Jesse and takes him to rehab.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Meanwhile, Walt is preparing to undergo surgery to remove his cancer. The website that Walt Jr. made to bring in anonymous donations—in reality being used by Saul to launder Walt&amp;#39;s drug money—has gained media attention due to its apparent success; Walt is uncomfortable in the spotlight. On the day of Walt&amp;#39;s operation, as he is put under anesthetics, he accidentally reveals the existence of a second cell phone he uses, making Skyler White suspicious of his activities again.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 13: Kim&amp;#39;s 41st birthday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 14 - February 17, 2009: ABQ&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Six weeks later, after Walt is released from the hospital, Skyler reveals to him that she has investigated his behavior of the past several months and found out he has lied to her many times. Walt offers to tell her everything if she stays, but she is too afraid to know and decides to leave him. By this time, Donald has returned to work as an air traffic controller. While on the job, his mind wanders back to Jane&amp;#39;s death; in his emotional state, he inadvertently allows the flight paths of two commercial airliners to cross over Albuquerque.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Walt is sitting beside his swimming pool when he is startled by an explosion overhead. He looks up to see a fireball in the sky above his house, the result of an apparent midair collison. Moments later, a charred pink teddy bear lands in the pool.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Numerous investigators from the NTSB collect and catalog debris, including a half-burnt pink teddy bear, that had fallen around the Whites&amp;#39; neighborhood. In the distance, two columns of smoke can be seen.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Gilliverse/comments/gbzy1b/timeline_vii/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timeline VII &amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.\n\nToday's interview is with Max Maher of [Skinny Wimp Moving](https://www.skinnywimpmoving.com), a brand that sells household moving services.\n\n**Some stats:**\n\n* Product: Household moving services.\n* Revenue/mo: $115,000\n* Started: November 2015\n* Location: Chandler\n* Founders: 2\n* Employees: 40\n\n### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?\n\nMy name is Max Maher I am a serial entrepreneur, lifelong learner, and a founder of Skinny Wimp Moving!\n\nStarting out, I formed a small landscaping company at 13, a sports supplement company at 16, then a pool service company, called [PoolsMax](http://poolsmax.com/) at 18. The amalgamation of these businesses along with ruthlessly saving enabled me to purchase existing moving trucks and warehouse space of an unprofitable moving company which became the first Skinny Wimp Moving Co franchise when I was 19.\n\n[Skinny Wimp Moving](http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com/) provides household and commercial moving services based out of Phoenix, Arizona with an emphasis on customer comfort, simple pricing, and friendly faces.\n\nI am now 23 years old and my locations average $115,000 a month in revenue with record monthly sales of $158,000.\n\n[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/001/583/original/open-uri20190515-4-779c2p?1557910742)\n\n*Photo of me at 19 in my first moving truck.*\n\n### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?\n\nI didn’t exactly come up with the initial idea for this company because this is a franchise which means for me that I license out the name “Skinny Wimp Moving”. However, because it was the first franchise location I was able to be in a prime decision-making seat and guinea pig for all ideas enabling me to test out theories on marketing and customer service which have no become standard across the brand.\n\nWe realized people simply don’t want a moving company that sucks. So we asked ourselves what can we do to make the stressful experience of moving suck a little less and the answers we came up with and stuck to were very common sense:\n\n- Friendly, clean cut movers.\n\n- Pricing structure that is a simple all-inclusive hourly rate with no hidden fees\n\n- Protecting every single piece of furniture.\n\n- Showing up on time \n\n- Always answering the phone\n\nDoing these simple things that our competitors were neglecting allowed us to grow 1400% in the first 15 months alone. Nearly everyone you talk to has had some form of poor moving experience to the point where it seems people were less looking for great movers and more trying to avoid nightmare movers creating a huge opportunity for us. Our service has been validated thousands of times over via the number of referrals from people whose friend told them they have to use us and hundreds of industry professionals like realtors and storage facilities who confidently refer us on a regular basis.\n\nMy expertise in the area is a bit of a funny story. I had moved from Minnesota to Arizona at 18 to start a pool cleaning business and while I was building this brand up large enough to sustain myself I worked part time at a moving company. After about two months when my business got busy enough I left the moving company.\n\nThen about 3 months later I was contacted by the owner of that moving company who was trying to sell, so I met with him and ended up buying the moving company I used to work for. I sunk every bit of my savings into the venture, basically going broke to make it work.\n\n[image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/001/584/original/open-uri20190515-4-199nsc9?1557910742)\n\n### Describe the process of launching the business.\n\nInitially I used every dollar of my savings from my previous small businesses (around $18,000) to purchase insurance policies, equipment, and the down payments on the trucks.\n\nMy first clients were landed though storage facility referrals. I would go into these facilities and pitch how I would love to help anyone moving in or out and will basically do anything to get the job. I think they could tell I actually cared about how it would go and luckily a few gave me a shot. I still do this form of marketing to this day.\n\nI got my first few jobs quite quickly which meant I needed employees fast. What I did was go to the gym I worked out at and walked up to two random guys, started chatting, and basically convinced them to go a move with me the next day. So I invited them over to my house and showed them how to wrap up the furniture in my living room and what my expectations were. I’m honestly surprised it went smoothly looking back.\n\nI remember the very first move I did was for $950 and I was doing the math on if I did that 5 times a week that’s $4,750! Or Woah! What if I could do that 40 times a month! $38,000!\n\nFrom there, I used every dollar of incoming capital and deposits from upcoming booked moves to fund expenses. I went 28 months before receiving my first paycheck from this business due to re-investing every dollar back into the company. Luckily, I still owned PoolsMax which I used to pay my bills.\n\nWe grew fairly rapidly in the first few months as I was trying to do absolutely everything I could on jobs to provide the best possible customer services. Word of mouth referrals started rolling in.\n\nBefore starting I was concerned I would have a hard time managing people who were all older than me. I was pleasantly surprised that If I worked hard and treated my workers with respect they had no issues with working for me and many actually wanted to “the young guy” to succeed.\n\nI learned to do everything I can to make the right hire the first time. In the beginning I would try out any guy that seems decent. Now we may hire 1 out of 20 movers that come in to interview and we spend 5x the time training them. The right people make life and business much easier.\n\n### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?\n\nMarketing areas that have worked with their respective pros and cons:\n\n#### Google ads\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Very targeted: It is possible to target very narrow demographics or even target groups by recent life events\n\n- Majority of people search Google first\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Without a very large budget it is hard to make a big ripple. It seems more and more that the only way to have a huge effect is by having a huge budget.\n\n#### **Yelp ads**\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Yelp has high consumer trust. Many people take Yelp’s recommendations as if it were a friend telling them.\n\n- If you can rank #1 in a city for a service you yield massive results. There doesn’t seem to be much of a long tail in that the top three or so results get all the business.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- Predatory sales tactics: They are a bit harassing with their phone calls and claim it helps the page\n\n- Real reviews getting taken down. They have a recommendation system in which certain reviews become unviewable this tends to happen to at least 50% of reviews.\n\n- Contracts for ads. They don’t allow month to month deals.\n\n#### Groupon\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Easy way to increase traffic if you are a new business\n\n- They will advertise for you: They run Google ads advertising your company.\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- They require a very low, somewhat un-sustainable price.\n\n#### In-Person Marketing (my favorite)\n\nI like to constantly think about what my competition isn’t doing. We live in a time where everyone’s marketing efforts consists of online ads and not very much in person marketing.\n\nIt’s a bit awkward at times and it takes a lot of effort but this is by far the best form of marketing I have utilized. I recently documented the process of me making a connections with 500 businesses that could potentially refer my business to their clients and it yielded me a reoccurring $30,000-$40,000 in additional sales per month. The entire process and results can be seen here.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYwiK6uBsZo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYwiK6uBsZo)\n\n**Pros:**\n\n- Extremely effective\n\n- Cheap to do\n\n**Cons:**\n\n- A lot of effort\n\n### How are you doing today and what does the future look like?\n\nAt Skinny Wimp we are currently working on quality above all else. I have recently hired a quality control manager at my main Phoenix, Arizona location whose sole job is to ensure our movers are the best possible version of themselves.\n\nWe have build a weight rating system of 7 key metrics in which we grade our movers:\n\n- Professionalism\n\n- Timeliness\n\n- Protection of furniture\n\n- In-home protection\n\n- Friendliness\n\n- Safe driving\n\n- And a miscellaneous metric\n\n**Storage**\n\nWe are looking to expand to storage services within the year in order to better serve our customers with a one-stop shop. This is very capital intensive, though, so it is going to take a good bit of effort and planning. The ultimate goal is to build the storage business larger than the moving business. The margins in the storage industry are very high compared to the moving industry (around 30% for my moving companies and we are on the high end) compared to up to 60% for storage.\n\n**YouTube**\n\nPersonally, I have a YouTube channel in which I display my favorite things in life learning/self-improvement. I document a mix of business challenges/struggles (things like this [short case study on my experiment working 10 hours a day for 50 days straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPv-Wd20SFQ%26t=224s)) and personal goal setting as well. As the channel grows we are working on doing bigger and bigger projects like my upcoming documentary on my experience training for and running an ultra-marathon which will be released mid April. My goal of this channel is to lead by example to influence people to get out of their comfort zone, try new things, and build the best versions of themselves.. Not because it’s easy but because it’s hard.\n\n### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?\n\nMy biggest business mistake to date was expanding to new states hundreds of miles away too soon. We should have waited a little longer, built out systems and built up capital a little longer before taking on such an audacious project.\n\nThe farther away new locations are from the primary the harder it is to manage new locations. It ended up alright in the end but at the cost of extreme pressures and stress, it may have been a lesson I needed to learn because I tend to jump into things quickly.\n\nThe best decision I made was not paying myself for the first few years. By building up the bank account instead of buying myself fancy things I was able to much more easily get through some of the hard times that inevitably come up.\n\n### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?\n\nI am a huge consumer of educational material.\n\nMy favorite books of the last year are:\n\nNever Split the Difference which helped me massively in conflict negotiation and interpersonal conflicts\n\nPoor Charlie’s Almanac because it inspired me further to become a lifelong learner and the benefits of such a thing\n\nIdea Man which ada he impact on me. I never realized the masie effect Paul Allen had on the world and it made me realize that is exactly what I ultimately want in life, to positively affect the greatest number of people.\n\nMy favorite podcasts are How I Built This and The Sweaty Startup for business stories and lessons and Mindscape for all things science.\n\n### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?\n\nTwo of the top questions I get asked from young entrepreneurs are “When should I start?” and “How should I market?” They are very good questions and here is how I would address them:\n\n*When should I start?*\n\n**Just Go**\n\n- That perfect time you’ve been waiting for to start isn’t going to come.\n\n- Your product/service will never be perfect before launch. \n\n- You probably ever have the ideal amount of time, energy, or money it takes to launch perfectly. \n\n**Things You Should Focus on Instead of When to Start**\n\n*How can I get my product/service out there as quickly and efficiently as possible?*\n\nThink in terms of what your Minimum Viable Product is. This is a concept developed by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup and a technique that has ben used to start some of today’s biggest businesses such as Twitter, dropbox, Groupon, and zappos. This concept in its simplest form is figuring out what the bare minimum is to launch your business and provide value, then do it. Launching your MVP prevents you from wasting resources on things that may end up having no value. The last thing you want to do is spend years planning and creating this grand plan only to find after launch that customers only care about one portion of your idea.\n\nIt’s easier to learn what the market likes than it is to guess what the market wants.\n\nThis doesn’t just apply to tech companies.\n\nLet's say you want to start a landscaping business. Yes it would be wonderful to buy a brand new truck $50,000 and mower $1,500 and tools $1000 and website $1000 and get an office space for $2000 down. But let’s break down what you truly need to start. An old vehicle, push mower, and business cards will do just fine, $4000.\n\nNow some of you might be thinking I don’t even have $4k so I can’t start a business. So let’s go one step further and limit our service line down to things done by hand. Shoveling, raking, and pulling weeds. What does it really take to start that business? Used hand tools for $70 and business cards for $30. You don’t even need a vehicle, you can walk yard to yard if you have to. So we just took our faraway goal of saving $55,500 to start the perfect landscaping business to a $100 business that we can start today and begin making money.\n\nThe true beauty of this is now that it costs you less than $100 to start a business you can try it and if it doesn’t work or you don’t like it move on to the next $100 start-up\n\nYou may be thinking “How am I ever going to grow or make real money if I’m raking a yard myself for $20 a house when I could never do more than 50 houses?” and that brings us to next point of doing things that don’t scale. This is a famous philosophy by Paul Graham of Y Combinator. It basically means it is *okay* and actually a good strategy to do things now that won’t work when your business grows to the next stage. That is because without it your business may never even grow to the next stage!\n\nWorry about how you’ll handle 60 accounts when you’re already at 50 accounts and earning the income of 50 accounts, not when you’re at 0\n\n**Don’t Assume You Have a Lot of Time**\n\nWhatever age you are, seize every day. Every single day that you’re not out progressing yourself or your business is a day lost.\n\nLet’s say on days you work you make $100 and you could have worked today but you took the day off. You need to think in terms that you didn’t just miss out on $100 but you actually lost $100. And we can take that one step further. Let's say every $100 you invest back in your business returns you 10% a year so that’s:\n\n- $110 after year 1. \n\n- $161.05 after year 5. \n\n- $259.37 after year 10.        \n\n- $672.72 after year 20. \n\nIt gets much crazier after that. The point is today ALWAYS matters and the sooner you start the sooner you can use this compounding to your advantage not your disadvantage.\n\n**How Should I Market?**\n\nThis is obviously something that varies quite a bit from industry to industry but when approaching marketing I like to go back to the thought process of “What can I do today?” and “How many things can I try for the lowest cost possible?”. If you have a low amount of cash to spend your greatest asset will be willpower and getting face to face with as many people related to your business as possible.\n\n**Knock Twice Marketing**\n\nThis is a type of marketing I find extremely effective. It is based on the premise you should never try to sell to someone just once.\n\nMarketing when you first start a business is hard. *Think persistence*. People admire persistence especially from young people because it’s a trait they hope other’s see in them.\n\n- **Most**  people will never ask for your business because of the fear of rejection. \n\n- **Some**  people will knock once or ask for your business once. \n\n- **Almost**  no one will keep knocking after the first no. Now I’m not saying to be an overly aggressive salesman I’m talking about just a friendly “Hey I’m still here and I would love to have your business”\n\nThink about what it takes you to use a business. Are you going to use the company that you saw one advertisement for or the one you see and are reminded of every week?\n\nThe power of persistence has helped me more times than I can count. And a perfect example is for one of my businesses I do cold pitches to businesses or people who can refer my business to their clients. I walked into a store and gave my pitch to the assistant manager who said “Sounds great, my manager deals with vendors, I’ll make sure she contacts you.” so I leave and three days later no response from the manager.. I type up a friendly email about how I talked to her assistant manager and what I am hoping to get accomplished . A week later, no response. I go back to the same store and the manager is there, I mention who I am, that I talked to her assistant and that I was hoping to become a vendor. That’s when she remembered my email and said “Oh yeah, I was going to respond to your email but we’ve been swamped so I haven’t been able to yet, I apologize for that! I saw you have great reviews and think you’d be a good fit” she then pulled out the form to become a vendor and I filled it out on the spot. I could have quit any step of that process and wouldn’t currently be receiving income from that contract.\n\n**In Conclusion**\n\nStart now, put yourself out there and ask for their business. Sure be conscious that you may get rejected but don’t be afraid to ask more than once. It won’t work every time but it will work 100% more than not trying at all.\n\n### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?\n\nI don’t have a specific position I currently need filled but I would never turn down the opportunity to speak with a passionate, skilled person who may be able to help out my company.\n\nHowever, as I mentioned I am looking to get into the storage business, so I am the process of looking for investors for this next step.\n\nWe are always looking for new movers/crew leads to join us and rise up the ranks.\n\n### Where can we go to learn more?\n\nPersonal\n\n- [https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher](https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher)\n\n- [https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/](https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/)\n\n- becauseitshard@gmail.com\n\nBusiness\n\n- [www.skinnywimpmoving.com](http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com)\n\n- [www.poolsmax.com](http://www.poolsmax.com)\n\nIf you have any questions or comments, drop a comment below!\n\n\n\n---\n\nLiked this text interview?

Who are you and what business did you start?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My name is Max Maher I am a serial entrepreneur, lifelong learner, and a founder of Skinny Wimp Moving!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting out, I formed a small landscaping company at 13, a sports supplement company at 16, then a pool service company, called &lt;a href=\"http://poolsmax.com/\"&gt;PoolsMax&lt;/a&gt; at 18. The amalgamation of these businesses along with ruthlessly saving enabled me to purchase existing moving trucks and warehouse space of an unprofitable moving company which became the first Skinny Wimp Moving Co franchise when I was 19.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com/\"&gt;Skinny Wimp Moving&lt;/a&gt; provides household and commercial moving services based out of Phoenix, Arizona with an emphasis on customer comfort, simple pricing, and friendly faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am now 23 years old and my locations average $115,000 a month in revenue with record monthly sales of $158,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/001/583/original/open-uri20190515-4-779c2p?1557910742\"&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo of me at 19 in my first moving truck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t exactly come up with the initial idea for this company because this is a franchise which means for me that I license out the name “Skinny Wimp Moving”. However, because it was the first franchise location I was able to be in a prime decision-making seat and guinea pig for all ideas enabling me to test out theories on marketing and customer service which have no become standard across the brand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We realized people simply don’t want a moving company that sucks. So we asked ourselves what can we do to make the stressful experience of moving suck a little less and the answers we came up with and stuck to were very common sense:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendly, clean cut movers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing structure that is a simple all-inclusive hourly rate with no hidden fees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting every single piece of furniture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showing up on time &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always answering the phone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing these simple things that our competitors were neglecting allowed us to grow 1400% in the first 15 months alone. Nearly everyone you talk to has had some form of poor moving experience to the point where it seems people were less looking for great movers and more trying to avoid nightmare movers creating a huge opportunity for us. Our service has been validated thousands of times over via the number of referrals from people whose friend told them they have to use us and hundreds of industry professionals like realtors and storage facilities who confidently refer us on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My expertise in the area is a bit of a funny story. I had moved from Minnesota to Arizona at 18 to start a pool cleaning business and while I was building this brand up large enough to sustain myself I worked part time at a moving company. After about two months when my business got busy enough I left the moving company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then about 3 months later I was contacted by the owner of that moving company who was trying to sell, so I met with him and ended up buying the moving company I used to work for. I sunk every bit of my savings into the venture, basically going broke to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.starterstory.com/story_images/images/000/001/584/original/open-uri20190515-4-199nsc9?1557910742\"&gt;image&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Describe the process of launching the business.&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially I used every dollar of my savings from my previous small businesses (around $18,000) to purchase insurance policies, equipment, and the down payments on the trucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first clients were landed though storage facility referrals. I would go into these facilities and pitch how I would love to help anyone moving in or out and will basically do anything to get the job. I think they could tell I actually cared about how it would go and luckily a few gave me a shot. I still do this form of marketing to this day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got my first few jobs quite quickly which meant I needed employees fast. What I did was go to the gym I worked out at and walked up to two random guys, started chatting, and basically convinced them to go a move with me the next day. So I invited them over to my house and showed them how to wrap up the furniture in my living room and what my expectations were. I’m honestly surprised it went smoothly looking back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember the very first move I did was for $950 and I was doing the math on if I did that 5 times a week that’s $4,750! Or Woah! What if I could do that 40 times a month! $38,000!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there, I used every dollar of incoming capital and deposits from upcoming booked moves to fund expenses. I went 28 months before receiving my first paycheck from this business due to re-investing every dollar back into the company. Luckily, I still owned PoolsMax which I used to pay my bills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We grew fairly rapidly in the first few months as I was trying to do absolutely everything I could on jobs to provide the best possible customer services. Word of mouth referrals started rolling in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before starting I was concerned I would have a hard time managing people who were all older than me. I was pleasantly surprised that If I worked hard and treated my workers with respect they had no issues with working for me and many actually wanted to “the young guy” to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned to do everything I can to make the right hire the first time. In the beginning I would try out any guy that seems decent. Now we may hire 1 out of 20 movers that come in to interview and we spend 5x the time training them. The right people make life and business much easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marketing areas that have worked with their respective pros and cons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Google ads&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very targeted: It is possible to target very narrow demographics or even target groups by recent life events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Majority of people search Google first&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Without a very large budget it is hard to make a big ripple. It seems more and more that the only way to have a huge effect is by having a huge budget.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yelp ads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yelp has high consumer trust. Many people take Yelp’s recommendations as if it were a friend telling them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can rank #1 in a city for a service you yield massive results. There doesn’t seem to be much of a long tail in that the top three or so results get all the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predatory sales tactics: They are a bit harassing with their phone calls and claim it helps the page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real reviews getting taken down. They have a recommendation system in which certain reviews become unviewable this tends to happen to at least 50% of reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contracts for ads. They don’t allow month to month deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Groupon&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy way to increase traffic if you are a new business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will advertise for you: They run Google ads advertising your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They require a very low, somewhat un-sustainable price.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;In-Person Marketing (my favorite)&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to constantly think about what my competition isn’t doing. We live in a time where everyone’s marketing efforts consists of online ads and not very much in person marketing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit awkward at times and it takes a lot of effort but this is by far the best form of marketing I have utilized. I recently documented the process of me making a connections with 500 businesses that could potentially refer my business to their clients and it yielded me a reoccurring $30,000-$40,000 in additional sales per month. The entire process and results can be seen here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYwiK6uBsZo\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYwiK6uBsZo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extremely effective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheap to do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A lot of effort&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How are you doing today and what does the future look like?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At Skinny Wimp we are currently working on quality above all else. I have recently hired a quality control manager at my main Phoenix, Arizona location whose sole job is to ensure our movers are the best possible version of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have build a weight rating system of 7 key metrics in which we grade our movers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professionalism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timeliness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection of furniture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-home protection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendliness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe driving&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a miscellaneous metric&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking to expand to storage services within the year in order to better serve our customers with a one-stop shop. This is very capital intensive, though, so it is going to take a good bit of effort and planning. The ultimate goal is to build the storage business larger than the moving business. The margins in the storage industry are very high compared to the moving industry (around 30% for my moving companies and we are on the high end) compared to up to 60% for storage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have a YouTube channel in which I display my favorite things in life learning/self-improvement. I document a mix of business challenges/struggles (things like this &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPv-Wd20SFQ%26t=224s\"&gt;short case study on my experiment working 10 hours a day for 50 days straight&lt;/a&gt;) and personal goal setting as well. As the channel grows we are working on doing bigger and bigger projects like my upcoming documentary on my experience training for and running an ultra-marathon which will be released mid April. My goal of this channel is to lead by example to influence people to get out of their comfort zone, try new things, and build the best versions of themselves.. Not because it’s easy but because it’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My biggest business mistake to date was expanding to new states hundreds of miles away too soon. We should have waited a little longer, built out systems and built up capital a little longer before taking on such an audacious project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The farther away new locations are from the primary the harder it is to manage new locations. It ended up alright in the end but at the cost of extreme pressures and stress, it may have been a lesson I needed to learn because I tend to jump into things quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best decision I made was not paying myself for the first few years. By building up the bank account instead of buying myself fancy things I was able to much more easily get through some of the hard times that inevitably come up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a huge consumer of educational material.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite books of the last year are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never Split the Difference which helped me massively in conflict negotiation and interpersonal conflicts&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poor Charlie’s Almanac because it inspired me further to become a lifelong learner and the benefits of such a thing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idea Man which ada he impact on me. I never realized the masie effect Paul Allen had on the world and it made me realize that is exactly what I ultimately want in life, to positively affect the greatest number of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite podcasts are How I Built This and The Sweaty Startup for business stories and lessons and Mindscape for all things science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two of the top questions I get asked from young entrepreneurs are “When should I start?” and “How should I market?” They are very good questions and here is how I would address them:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When should I start?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That perfect time you’ve been waiting for to start isn’t going to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your product/service will never be perfect before launch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably ever have the ideal amount of time, energy, or money it takes to launch perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things You Should Focus on Instead of When to Start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can I get my product/service out there as quickly and efficiently as possible?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think in terms of what your Minimum Viable Product is. This is a concept developed by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup and a technique that has ben used to start some of today’s biggest businesses such as Twitter, dropbox, Groupon, and zappos. This concept in its simplest form is figuring out what the bare minimum is to launch your business and provide value, then do it. Launching your MVP prevents you from wasting resources on things that may end up having no value. The last thing you want to do is spend years planning and creating this grand plan only to find after launch that customers only care about one portion of your idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s easier to learn what the market likes than it is to guess what the market wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t just apply to tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you want to start a landscaping business. Yes it would be wonderful to buy a brand new truck $50,000 and mower $1,500 and tools $1000 and website $1000 and get an office space for $2000 down. But let’s break down what you truly need to start. An old vehicle, push mower, and business cards will do just fine, $4000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now some of you might be thinking I don’t even have $4k so I can’t start a business. So let’s go one step further and limit our service line down to things done by hand. Shoveling, raking, and pulling weeds. What does it really take to start that business? Used hand tools for $70 and business cards for $30. You don’t even need a vehicle, you can walk yard to yard if you have to. So we just took our faraway goal of saving $55,500 to start the perfect landscaping business to a $100 business that we can start today and begin making money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The true beauty of this is now that it costs you less than $100 to start a business you can try it and if it doesn’t work or you don’t like it move on to the next $100 start-up&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may be thinking “How am I ever going to grow or make real money if I’m raking a yard myself for $20 a house when I could never do more than 50 houses?” and that brings us to next point of doing things that don’t scale. This is a famous philosophy by Paul Graham of Y Combinator. It basically means it is &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; and actually a good strategy to do things now that won’t work when your business grows to the next stage. That is because without it your business may never even grow to the next stage!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worry about how you’ll handle 60 accounts when you’re already at 50 accounts and earning the income of 50 accounts, not when you’re at 0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Assume You Have a Lot of Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever age you are, seize every day. Every single day that you’re not out progressing yourself or your business is a day lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s say on days you work you make $100 and you could have worked today but you took the day off. You need to think in terms that you didn’t just miss out on $100 but you actually lost $100. And we can take that one step further. Let&amp;#39;s say every $100 you invest back in your business returns you 10% a year so that’s:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$110 after year 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$161.05 after year 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$259.37 after year 10.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$672.72 after year 20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets much crazier after that. The point is today ALWAYS matters and the sooner you start the sooner you can use this compounding to your advantage not your disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Should I Market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is obviously something that varies quite a bit from industry to industry but when approaching marketing I like to go back to the thought process of “What can I do today?” and “How many things can I try for the lowest cost possible?”. If you have a low amount of cash to spend your greatest asset will be willpower and getting face to face with as many people related to your business as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knock Twice Marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a type of marketing I find extremely effective. It is based on the premise you should never try to sell to someone just once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marketing when you first start a business is hard. &lt;em&gt;Think persistence&lt;/em&gt;. People admire persistence especially from young people because it’s a trait they hope other’s see in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most&lt;/strong&gt;  people will never ask for your business because of the fear of rejection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some&lt;/strong&gt;  people will knock once or ask for your business once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost&lt;/strong&gt;  no one will keep knocking after the first no. Now I’m not saying to be an overly aggressive salesman I’m talking about just a friendly “Hey I’m still here and I would love to have your business”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about what it takes you to use a business. Are you going to use the company that you saw one advertisement for or the one you see and are reminded of every week?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The power of persistence has helped me more times than I can count. And a perfect example is for one of my businesses I do cold pitches to businesses or people who can refer my business to their clients. I walked into a store and gave my pitch to the assistant manager who said “Sounds great, my manager deals with vendors, I’ll make sure she contacts you.” so I leave and three days later no response from the manager.. I type up a friendly email about how I talked to her assistant manager and what I am hoping to get accomplished . A week later, no response. I go back to the same store and the manager is there, I mention who I am, that I talked to her assistant and that I was hoping to become a vendor. That’s when she remembered my email and said “Oh yeah, I was going to respond to your email but we’ve been swamped so I haven’t been able to yet, I apologize for that! I saw you have great reviews and think you’d be a good fit” she then pulled out the form to become a vendor and I filled it out on the spot. I could have quit any step of that process and wouldn’t currently be receiving income from that contract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start now, put yourself out there and ask for their business. Sure be conscious that you may get rejected but don’t be afraid to ask more than once. It won’t work every time but it will work 100% more than not trying at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a specific position I currently need filled but I would never turn down the opportunity to speak with a passionate, skilled person who may be able to help out my company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, as I mentioned I am looking to get into the storage business, so I am the process of looking for investors for this next step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are always looking for new movers/crew leads to join us and rise up the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Where can we go to learn more?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personal&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/\"&gt;https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:becauseitshard@gmail.com\"&gt;becauseitshard@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Business&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com\"&gt;www.skinnywimpmoving.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.poolsmax.com\"&gt;www.poolsmax.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or comments, drop a comment below!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Liked this text interview?

Who are you and what business did you start?\r\n\r\nMy name is Max Maher I am a serial entrepreneur, lifelong learner, and a founder of Skinny Wimp Moving!\r\n\r\nStarting out, I formed a small landscaping company at 13, a sports supplement company at 16, then a pool service company, called [PoolsMax](http://poolsmax.com/) at 18. The amalgamation of these businesses along with ruthlessly saving enabled me to purchase existing moving trucks and warehouse space of an unprofitable moving company which became the first Skinny Wimp Moving Co franchise when I was 19.\r\n\r\n[Skinny Wimp Moving](http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com/) provides household and commercial moving services based out of Phoenix, Arizona with an emphasis on customer comfort, simple pricing, and friendly faces.\r\n\r\nI am now 23 years old and my locations average $115,000 a month in revenue with record monthly sales of $158,000.\r\n\r\n*Photo of me at 19 in my first moving truck.*\r\n\r\n### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?\r\n\r\nI didn’t exactly come up with the initial idea for this company because this is a franchise which means for me that I license out the name “Skinny Wimp Moving”. However, because it was the first franchise location I was able to be in a prime decision-making seat and guinea pig for all ideas enabling me to test out theories on marketing and customer service which have no become standard across the brand.\r\n\r\nWe realized people simply don’t want a moving company that sucks. So we asked ourselves what can we do to make the stressful experience of moving suck a little less and the answers we came up with and stuck to were very common sense:\r\n\r\n- Friendly, clean cut movers.\r\n\r\n- Pricing structure that is a simple all-inclusive hourly rate with no hidden fees\r\n\r\n- Protecting every single piece of furniture.\r\n\r\n- Showing up on time \r\n\r\n- Always answering the phone\r\n\r\nDoing these simple things that our competitors were neglecting allowed us to grow 1400% in the first 15 months alone. Nearly everyone you talk to has had some form of poor moving experience to the point where it seems people were less looking for great movers and more trying to avoid nightmare movers creating a huge opportunity for us. Our service has been validated thousands of times over via the number of referrals from people whose friend told them they have to use us and hundreds of industry professionals like realtors and storage facilities who confidently refer us on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nMy expertise in the area is a bit of a funny story. I had moved from Minnesota to Arizona at 18 to start a pool cleaning business and while I was building this brand up large enough to sustain myself I worked part time at a moving company. After about two months when my business got busy enough I left the moving company.\r\n\r\nThen about 3 months later I was contacted by the owner of that moving company who was trying to sell, so I met with him and ended up buying the moving company I used to work for. I sunk every bit of my savings into the venture, basically going broke to make it work.\r\n\r\n### Describe the process of launching the business.\r\n\r\nInitially I used every dollar of my savings from my previous small businesses (around $18,000) to purchase insurance policies, equipment, and the down payments on the trucks.\r\n\r\nMy first clients were landed though storage facility referrals. I would go into these facilities and pitch how I would love to help anyone moving in or out and will basically do anything to get the job. I think they could tell I actually cared about how it would go and luckily a few gave me a shot. I still do this form of marketing to this day.\r\n\r\nI got my first few jobs quite quickly which meant I needed employees fast. What I did was go to the gym I worked out at and walked up to two random guys, started chatting, and basically convinced them to go a move with me the next day. So I invited them over to my house and showed them how to wrap up the furniture in my living room and what my expectations were. I’m honestly surprised it went smoothly looking back.\r\n\r\nI remember the very first move I did was for $950 and I was doing the math on if I did that 5 times a week that’s $4,750! Or Woah! What if I could do that 40 times a month! $38,000!\r\n\r\nFrom there, I used every dollar of incoming capital and deposits from upcoming booked moves to fund expenses. I went 28 months before receiving my first paycheck from this business due to re-investing every dollar back into the company. Luckily, I still owned PoolsMax which I used to pay my bills.\r\n\r\nWe grew fairly rapidly in the first few months as I was trying to do absolutely everything I could on jobs to provide the best possible customer services. Word of mouth referrals started rolling in.\r\n\r\nBefore starting I was concerned I would have a hard time managing people who were all older than me. I was pleasantly surprised that If I worked hard and treated my workers with respect they had no issues with working for me and many actually wanted to “the young guy” to succeed.\r\n\r\nI learned to do everything I can to make the right hire the first time. In the beginning I would try out any guy that seems decent. Now we may hire 1 out of 20 movers that come in to interview and we spend 5x the time training them. The right people make life and business much easier.\r\n\r\n### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?\r\n\r\nMarketing areas that have worked with their respective pros and cons:\r\n\r\n#### Google ads\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- Very targeted: It is possible to target very narrow demographics or even target groups by recent life events\r\n\r\n- Majority of people search Google first\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- Without a very large budget it is hard to make a big ripple. It seems more and more that the only way to have a huge effect is by having a huge budget.\r\n\r\n#### **Yelp ads**\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- Yelp has high consumer trust. Many people take Yelp’s recommendations as if it were a friend telling them.\r\n\r\n- If you can rank #1 in a city for a service you yield massive results. There doesn’t seem to be much of a long tail in that the top three or so results get all the business.\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- Predatory sales tactics: They are a bit harassing with their phone calls and claim it helps the page\r\n\r\n- Real reviews getting taken down. They have a recommendation system in which certain reviews become unviewable this tends to happen to at least 50% of reviews.\r\n\r\n- Contracts for ads. They don’t allow month to month deals.\r\n\r\n#### Groupon\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- Easy way to increase traffic if you are a new business\r\n\r\n- They will advertise for you: They run Google ads advertising your company.\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- They require a very low, somewhat un-sustainable price.\r\n\r\n#### In-Person Marketing (my favorite)\r\n\r\nI like to constantly think about what my competition isn’t doing. We live in a time where everyone’s marketing efforts consists of online ads and not very much in person marketing.\r\n\r\nIt’s a bit awkward at times and it takes a lot of effort but this is by far the best form of marketing I have utilized. I recently documented the process of me making a connections with 500 businesses that could potentially refer my business to their clients and it yielded me a reoccurring $30,000-$40,000 in additional sales per month. The entire process and results can be seen here.\r\n\r\n[YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYwiK6uBsZo)\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- Extremely effective\r\n\r\n- Cheap to do\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- A lot of effort\r\n\r\n### How are you doing today and what does the future look like?\r\n\r\nAt Skinny Wimp we are currently working on quality above all else. I have recently hired a quality control manager at my main Phoenix, Arizona location whose sole job is to ensure our movers are the best possible version of themselves.\r\n\r\nWe have build a weight rating system of 7 key metrics in which we grade our movers:\r\n\r\n- Professionalism\r\n\r\n- Timeliness\r\n\r\n- Protection of furniture\r\n\r\n- In-home protection\r\n\r\n- Friendliness\r\n\r\n- Safe driving\r\n\r\n- And a miscellaneous metric\r\n\r\n**Storage**\r\n\r\nWe are looking to expand to storage services within the year in order to better serve our customers with a one-stop shop. This is very capital intensive, though, so it is going to take a good bit of effort and planning. The ultimate goal is to build the storage business larger than the moving business. The margins in the storage industry are very high compared to the moving industry (around 30% for my moving companies and we are on the high end) compared to up to 60% for storage.\r\n\r\n**YouTube**\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have a YouTube channel in which I display my favorite things in life learning/self-improvement. I document a mix of business challenges/struggles (things like this [short case study on my experiment working 10 hours a day for 50 days straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPv-Wd20SFQ%26t=224s)) and personal goal setting as well. As the channel grows we are working on doing bigger and bigger projects like my upcoming documentary on my experience training for and running an ultra-marathon which will be released mid April. My goal of this channel is to lead by example to influence people to get out of their comfort zone, try new things, and build the best versions of themselves.. Not because it’s easy but because it’s hard.\r\n\r\n### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?\r\n\r\nMy biggest business mistake to date was expanding to new states hundreds of miles away too soon. We should have waited a little longer, built out systems and built up capital a little longer before taking on such an audacious project.\r\n\r\nThe farther away new locations are from the primary the harder it is to manage new locations. It ended up alright in the end but at the cost of extreme pressures and stress, it may have been a lesson I needed to learn because I tend to jump into things quickly.\r\n\r\nThe best decision I made was not paying myself for the first few years. By building up the bank account instead of buying myself fancy things I was able to much more easily get through some of the hard times that inevitably come up.\r\n\r\n### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?\r\n\r\nI am a huge consumer of educational material.\r\n\r\nMy favorite books of the last year are:\r\n\r\nNever Split the Difference which helped me massively in conflict negotiation and interpersonal conflicts\r\n\r\nPoor Charlie’s Almanac because it inspired me further to become a lifelong learner and the benefits of such a thing\r\n\r\nIdea Man which ada he impact on me. I never realized the masie effect Paul Allen had on the world and it made me realize that is exactly what I ultimately want in life, to positively affect the greatest number of people.\r\n\r\nMy favorite podcasts are How I Built This and The Sweaty Startup for business stories and lessons and Mindscape for all things science.\r\n\r\n### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?\r\n\r\nTwo of the top questions I get asked from young entrepreneurs are “When should I start?” and “How should I market?” They are very good questions and here is how I would address them:\r\n\r\n*When should I start?*\r\n\r\n**Just Go**\r\n\r\n- That perfect time you’ve been waiting for to start isn’t going to come.\r\n\r\n- Your product/service will never be perfect before launch. \r\n\r\n- You probably ever have the ideal amount of time, energy, or money it takes to launch perfectly. \r\n\r\n**Things You Should Focus on Instead of When to Start**\r\n\r\n*How can I get my product/service out there as quickly and efficiently as possible?*\r\n\r\nThink in terms of what your Minimum Viable Product is. This is a concept developed by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup and a technique that has ben used to start some of today’s biggest businesses such as Twitter, dropbox, Groupon, and zappos. This concept in its simplest form is figuring out what the bare minimum is to launch your business and provide value, then do it. Launching your MVP prevents you from wasting resources on things that may end up having no value. The last thing you want to do is spend years planning and creating this grand plan only to find after launch that customers only care about one portion of your idea.\r\n\r\nIt’s easier to learn what the market likes than it is to guess what the market wants.\r\n\r\nThis doesn’t just apply to tech companies.\r\n\r\nLet's say you want to start a landscaping business. Yes it would be wonderful to buy a brand new truck $50,000 and mower $1,500 and tools $1000 and website $1000 and get an office space for $2000 down. But let’s break down what you truly need to start. An old vehicle, push mower, and business cards will do just fine, $4000.\r\n\r\nNow some of you might be thinking I don’t even have $4k so I can’t start a business. So let’s go one step further and limit our service line down to things done by hand. Shoveling, raking, and pulling weeds. What does it really take to start that business? Used hand tools for $70 and business cards for $30. You don’t even need a vehicle, you can walk yard to yard if you have to. So we just took our faraway goal of saving $55,500 to start the perfect landscaping business to a $100 business that we can start today and begin making money.\r\n\r\nThe true beauty of this is now that it costs you less than $100 to start a business you can try it and if it doesn’t work or you don’t like it move on to the next $100 start-up\r\n\r\nYou may be thinking “How am I ever going to grow or make real money if I’m raking a yard myself for $20 a house when I could never do more than 50 houses?” and that brings us to next point of doing things that don’t scale. This is a famous philosophy by Paul Graham of Y Combinator. It basically means it is *okay* and actually a good strategy to do things now that won’t work when your business grows to the next stage. That is because without it your business may never even grow to the next stage!\r\n\r\nWorry about how you’ll handle 60 accounts when you’re already at 50 accounts and earning the income of 50 accounts, not when you’re at 0\r\n\r\n**Don’t Assume You Have a Lot of Time**\r\n\r\nWhatever age you are, seize every day. Every single day that you’re not out progressing yourself or your business is a day lost.\r\n\r\nLet’s say on days you work you make $100 and you could have worked today but you took the day off. You need to think in terms that you didn’t just miss out on $100 but you actually lost $100. And we can take that one step further. Let's say every $100 you invest back in your business returns you 10% a year so that’s:\r\n\r\n- $110 after year 1. \r\n\r\n- $161.05 after year 5. \r\n\r\n- $259.37 after year 10.        \r\n\r\n- $672.72 after year 20. \r\n\r\nIt gets much crazier after that. The point is today ALWAYS matters and the sooner you start the sooner you can use this compounding to your advantage not your disadvantage.\r\n\r\n**How Should I Market?**\r\n\r\nThis is obviously something that varies quite a bit from industry to industry but when approaching marketing I like to go back to the thought process of “What can I do today?” and “How many things can I try for the lowest cost possible?”. If you have a low amount of cash to spend your greatest asset will be willpower and getting face to face with as many people related to your business as possible.\r\n\r\n**Knock Twice Marketing**\r\n\r\nThis is a type of marketing I find extremely effective. It is based on the premise you should never try to sell to someone just once.\r\n\r\nMarketing when you first start a business is hard. *Think persistence*. People admire persistence especially from young people because it’s a trait they hope other’s see in them.\r\n\r\n- **Most**  people will never ask for your business because of the fear of rejection. \r\n\r\n- **Some**  people will knock once or ask for your business once. \r\n\r\n- **Almost**  no one will keep knocking after the first no. Now I’m not saying to be an overly aggressive salesman I’m talking about just a friendly “Hey I’m still here and I would love to have your business”\r\n\r\nThink about what it takes you to use a business. Are you going to use the company that you saw one advertisement for or the one you see and are reminded of every week?\r\n\r\nThe power of persistence has helped me more times than I can count. And a perfect example is for one of my businesses I do cold pitches to businesses or people who can refer my business to their clients. I walked into a store and gave my pitch to the assistant manager who said “Sounds great, my manager deals with vendors, I’ll make sure she contacts you.” so I leave and three days later no response from the manager.. I type up a friendly email about how I talked to her assistant manager and what I am hoping to get accomplished . A week later, no response. I go back to the same store and the manager is there, I mention who I am, that I talked to her assistant and that I was hoping to become a vendor. That’s when she remembered my email and said “Oh yeah, I was going to respond to your email but we’ve been swamped so I haven’t been able to yet, I apologize for that! I saw you have great reviews and think you’d be a good fit” she then pulled out the form to become a vendor and I filled it out on the spot. I could have quit any step of that process and wouldn’t currently be receiving income from that contract.\r\n\r\n**In Conclusion**\r\n\r\nStart now, put yourself out there and ask for their business. Sure be conscious that you may get rejected but don’t be afraid to ask more than once. It won’t work every time but it will work 100% more than not trying at all.\r\n\r\n### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?\r\n\r\nI don’t have a specific position I currently need filled but I would never turn down the opportunity to speak with a passionate, skilled person who may be able to help out my company.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I mentioned I am looking to get into the storage business, so I am the process of looking for investors for this next step.\r\n\r\nWe are always looking for new movers/crew leads to join us and rise up the ranks.\r\n\r\n### Where can we go to learn more?\r\n\r\nPersonal\r\n\r\n- [https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher](https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher)\r\n\r\n- [https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/](https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/)\r\n\r\n- becauseitshard@gmail.com\r\n\r\nBusiness\r\n\r\n- [www.skinnywimpmoving.com](http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com)\r\n\r\n- [www.poolsmax.com](http://www.poolsmax.com)\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments, drop a comment below!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLiked this text interview?

Who are you and what business did you start?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My name is Max Maher I am a serial entrepreneur, lifelong learner, and a founder of Skinny Wimp Moving!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting out, I formed a small landscaping company at 13, a sports supplement company at 16, then a pool service company, called &lt;a href=\"http://poolsmax.com/\"&gt;PoolsMax&lt;/a&gt; at 18. The amalgamation of these businesses along with ruthlessly saving enabled me to purchase existing moving trucks and warehouse space of an unprofitable moving company which became the first Skinny Wimp Moving Co franchise when I was 19.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com/\"&gt;Skinny Wimp Moving&lt;/a&gt; provides household and commercial moving services based out of Phoenix, Arizona with an emphasis on customer comfort, simple pricing, and friendly faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am now 23 years old and my locations average $115,000 a month in revenue with record monthly sales of $158,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo of me at 19 in my first moving truck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t exactly come up with the initial idea for this company because this is a franchise which means for me that I license out the name “Skinny Wimp Moving”. However, because it was the first franchise location I was able to be in a prime decision-making seat and guinea pig for all ideas enabling me to test out theories on marketing and customer service which have no become standard across the brand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We realized people simply don’t want a moving company that sucks. So we asked ourselves what can we do to make the stressful experience of moving suck a little less and the answers we came up with and stuck to were very common sense:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendly, clean cut movers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing structure that is a simple all-inclusive hourly rate with no hidden fees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting every single piece of furniture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showing up on time &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always answering the phone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing these simple things that our competitors were neglecting allowed us to grow 1400% in the first 15 months alone. Nearly everyone you talk to has had some form of poor moving experience to the point where it seems people were less looking for great movers and more trying to avoid nightmare movers creating a huge opportunity for us. Our service has been validated thousands of times over via the number of referrals from people whose friend told them they have to use us and hundreds of industry professionals like realtors and storage facilities who confidently refer us on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My expertise in the area is a bit of a funny story. I had moved from Minnesota to Arizona at 18 to start a pool cleaning business and while I was building this brand up large enough to sustain myself I worked part time at a moving company. After about two months when my business got busy enough I left the moving company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then about 3 months later I was contacted by the owner of that moving company who was trying to sell, so I met with him and ended up buying the moving company I used to work for. I sunk every bit of my savings into the venture, basically going broke to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Describe the process of launching the business.&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially I used every dollar of my savings from my previous small businesses (around $18,000) to purchase insurance policies, equipment, and the down payments on the trucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first clients were landed though storage facility referrals. I would go into these facilities and pitch how I would love to help anyone moving in or out and will basically do anything to get the job. I think they could tell I actually cared about how it would go and luckily a few gave me a shot. I still do this form of marketing to this day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got my first few jobs quite quickly which meant I needed employees fast. What I did was go to the gym I worked out at and walked up to two random guys, started chatting, and basically convinced them to go a move with me the next day. So I invited them over to my house and showed them how to wrap up the furniture in my living room and what my expectations were. I’m honestly surprised it went smoothly looking back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember the very first move I did was for $950 and I was doing the math on if I did that 5 times a week that’s $4,750! Or Woah! What if I could do that 40 times a month! $38,000!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there, I used every dollar of incoming capital and deposits from upcoming booked moves to fund expenses. I went 28 months before receiving my first paycheck from this business due to re-investing every dollar back into the company. Luckily, I still owned PoolsMax which I used to pay my bills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We grew fairly rapidly in the first few months as I was trying to do absolutely everything I could on jobs to provide the best possible customer services. Word of mouth referrals started rolling in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before starting I was concerned I would have a hard time managing people who were all older than me. I was pleasantly surprised that If I worked hard and treated my workers with respect they had no issues with working for me and many actually wanted to “the young guy” to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned to do everything I can to make the right hire the first time. In the beginning I would try out any guy that seems decent. Now we may hire 1 out of 20 movers that come in to interview and we spend 5x the time training them. The right people make life and business much easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marketing areas that have worked with their respective pros and cons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Google ads&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very targeted: It is possible to target very narrow demographics or even target groups by recent life events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Majority of people search Google first&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Without a very large budget it is hard to make a big ripple. It seems more and more that the only way to have a huge effect is by having a huge budget.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yelp ads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yelp has high consumer trust. Many people take Yelp’s recommendations as if it were a friend telling them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can rank #1 in a city for a service you yield massive results. There doesn’t seem to be much of a long tail in that the top three or so results get all the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predatory sales tactics: They are a bit harassing with their phone calls and claim it helps the page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real reviews getting taken down. They have a recommendation system in which certain reviews become unviewable this tends to happen to at least 50% of reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contracts for ads. They don’t allow month to month deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Groupon&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy way to increase traffic if you are a new business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will advertise for you: They run Google ads advertising your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They require a very low, somewhat un-sustainable price.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;In-Person Marketing (my favorite)&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to constantly think about what my competition isn’t doing. We live in a time where everyone’s marketing efforts consists of online ads and not very much in person marketing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit awkward at times and it takes a lot of effort but this is by far the best form of marketing I have utilized. I recently documented the process of me making a connections with 500 businesses that could potentially refer my business to their clients and it yielded me a reoccurring $30,000-$40,000 in additional sales per month. The entire process and results can be seen here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYwiK6uBsZo\"&gt;YT video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extremely effective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheap to do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A lot of effort&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How are you doing today and what does the future look like?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At Skinny Wimp we are currently working on quality above all else. I have recently hired a quality control manager at my main Phoenix, Arizona location whose sole job is to ensure our movers are the best possible version of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have build a weight rating system of 7 key metrics in which we grade our movers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professionalism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timeliness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection of furniture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-home protection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendliness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe driving&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a miscellaneous metric&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking to expand to storage services within the year in order to better serve our customers with a one-stop shop. This is very capital intensive, though, so it is going to take a good bit of effort and planning. The ultimate goal is to build the storage business larger than the moving business. The margins in the storage industry are very high compared to the moving industry (around 30% for my moving companies and we are on the high end) compared to up to 60% for storage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have a YouTube channel in which I display my favorite things in life learning/self-improvement. I document a mix of business challenges/struggles (things like this &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPv-Wd20SFQ%26t=224s\"&gt;short case study on my experiment working 10 hours a day for 50 days straight&lt;/a&gt;) and personal goal setting as well. As the channel grows we are working on doing bigger and bigger projects like my upcoming documentary on my experience training for and running an ultra-marathon which will be released mid April. My goal of this channel is to lead by example to influence people to get out of their comfort zone, try new things, and build the best versions of themselves.. Not because it’s easy but because it’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My biggest business mistake to date was expanding to new states hundreds of miles away too soon. We should have waited a little longer, built out systems and built up capital a little longer before taking on such an audacious project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The farther away new locations are from the primary the harder it is to manage new locations. It ended up alright in the end but at the cost of extreme pressures and stress, it may have been a lesson I needed to learn because I tend to jump into things quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best decision I made was not paying myself for the first few years. By building up the bank account instead of buying myself fancy things I was able to much more easily get through some of the hard times that inevitably come up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a huge consumer of educational material.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite books of the last year are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never Split the Difference which helped me massively in conflict negotiation and interpersonal conflicts&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poor Charlie’s Almanac because it inspired me further to become a lifelong learner and the benefits of such a thing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idea Man which ada he impact on me. I never realized the masie effect Paul Allen had on the world and it made me realize that is exactly what I ultimately want in life, to positively affect the greatest number of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite podcasts are How I Built This and The Sweaty Startup for business stories and lessons and Mindscape for all things science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two of the top questions I get asked from young entrepreneurs are “When should I start?” and “How should I market?” They are very good questions and here is how I would address them:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When should I start?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That perfect time you’ve been waiting for to start isn’t going to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your product/service will never be perfect before launch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably ever have the ideal amount of time, energy, or money it takes to launch perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things You Should Focus on Instead of When to Start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can I get my product/service out there as quickly and efficiently as possible?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think in terms of what your Minimum Viable Product is. This is a concept developed by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup and a technique that has ben used to start some of today’s biggest businesses such as Twitter, dropbox, Groupon, and zappos. This concept in its simplest form is figuring out what the bare minimum is to launch your business and provide value, then do it. Launching your MVP prevents you from wasting resources on things that may end up having no value. The last thing you want to do is spend years planning and creating this grand plan only to find after launch that customers only care about one portion of your idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s easier to learn what the market likes than it is to guess what the market wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t just apply to tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you want to start a landscaping business. Yes it would be wonderful to buy a brand new truck $50,000 and mower $1,500 and tools $1000 and website $1000 and get an office space for $2000 down. But let’s break down what you truly need to start. An old vehicle, push mower, and business cards will do just fine, $4000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now some of you might be thinking I don’t even have $4k so I can’t start a business. So let’s go one step further and limit our service line down to things done by hand. Shoveling, raking, and pulling weeds. What does it really take to start that business? Used hand tools for $70 and business cards for $30. You don’t even need a vehicle, you can walk yard to yard if you have to. So we just took our faraway goal of saving $55,500 to start the perfect landscaping business to a $100 business that we can start today and begin making money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The true beauty of this is now that it costs you less than $100 to start a business you can try it and if it doesn’t work or you don’t like it move on to the next $100 start-up&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may be thinking “How am I ever going to grow or make real money if I’m raking a yard myself for $20 a house when I could never do more than 50 houses?” and that brings us to next point of doing things that don’t scale. This is a famous philosophy by Paul Graham of Y Combinator. It basically means it is &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; and actually a good strategy to do things now that won’t work when your business grows to the next stage. That is because without it your business may never even grow to the next stage!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worry about how you’ll handle 60 accounts when you’re already at 50 accounts and earning the income of 50 accounts, not when you’re at 0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Assume You Have a Lot of Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever age you are, seize every day. Every single day that you’re not out progressing yourself or your business is a day lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s say on days you work you make $100 and you could have worked today but you took the day off. You need to think in terms that you didn’t just miss out on $100 but you actually lost $100. And we can take that one step further. Let&amp;#39;s say every $100 you invest back in your business returns you 10% a year so that’s:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$110 after year 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$161.05 after year 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$259.37 after year 10.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$672.72 after year 20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets much crazier after that. The point is today ALWAYS matters and the sooner you start the sooner you can use this compounding to your advantage not your disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Should I Market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is obviously something that varies quite a bit from industry to industry but when approaching marketing I like to go back to the thought process of “What can I do today?” and “How many things can I try for the lowest cost possible?”. If you have a low amount of cash to spend your greatest asset will be willpower and getting face to face with as many people related to your business as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knock Twice Marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a type of marketing I find extremely effective. It is based on the premise you should never try to sell to someone just once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marketing when you first start a business is hard. &lt;em&gt;Think persistence&lt;/em&gt;. People admire persistence especially from young people because it’s a trait they hope other’s see in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most&lt;/strong&gt;  people will never ask for your business because of the fear of rejection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some&lt;/strong&gt;  people will knock once or ask for your business once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost&lt;/strong&gt;  no one will keep knocking after the first no. Now I’m not saying to be an overly aggressive salesman I’m talking about just a friendly “Hey I’m still here and I would love to have your business”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about what it takes you to use a business. Are you going to use the company that you saw one advertisement for or the one you see and are reminded of every week?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The power of persistence has helped me more times than I can count. And a perfect example is for one of my businesses I do cold pitches to businesses or people who can refer my business to their clients. I walked into a store and gave my pitch to the assistant manager who said “Sounds great, my manager deals with vendors, I’ll make sure she contacts you.” so I leave and three days later no response from the manager.. I type up a friendly email about how I talked to her assistant manager and what I am hoping to get accomplished . A week later, no response. I go back to the same store and the manager is there, I mention who I am, that I talked to her assistant and that I was hoping to become a vendor. That’s when she remembered my email and said “Oh yeah, I was going to respond to your email but we’ve been swamped so I haven’t been able to yet, I apologize for that! I saw you have great reviews and think you’d be a good fit” she then pulled out the form to become a vendor and I filled it out on the spot. I could have quit any step of that process and wouldn’t currently be receiving income from that contract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start now, put yourself out there and ask for their business. Sure be conscious that you may get rejected but don’t be afraid to ask more than once. It won’t work every time but it will work 100% more than not trying at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a specific position I currently need filled but I would never turn down the opportunity to speak with a passionate, skilled person who may be able to help out my company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, as I mentioned I am looking to get into the storage business, so I am the process of looking for investors for this next step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are always looking for new movers/crew leads to join us and rise up the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Where can we go to learn more?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personal&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/\"&gt;https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:becauseitshard@gmail.com\"&gt;becauseitshard@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Business&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com\"&gt;www.skinnywimpmoving.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.poolsmax.com\"&gt;www.poolsmax.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or comments, drop a comment below!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Liked this text interview?

          "selftext": "Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.\r\n\r\nToday's interview is with Max Maher of [Skinny Wimp Moving](https://www.skinnywimpmoving.com), a company that offers household moving services.\r\n\r\n**Some stats:**\r\n\r\n* Product: Household moving services.\r\n* Revenue/mo: $115,000\r\n* Started: November 2015\r\n* Location: Chandler\r\n* Founders: 2\r\n* Employees: 40\r\n\r\n### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?\r\n\r\nMy name is Max Maher I am a serial entrepreneur, lifelong learner, and a founder of Skinny Wimp Moving!\r\n\r\nStarting out, I formed a small landscaping company at 13, a sports supplement company at 16, then a pool service company, called [PoolsMax](http://poolsmax.com/) at 18. The amalgamation of these businesses along with ruthlessly saving enabled me to purchase existing moving trucks and warehouse space of an unprofitable moving company which became the first Skinny Wimp Moving Co franchise when I was 19.\r\n\r\n[Skinny Wimp Moving](http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com/) provides household and commercial moving services based out of Phoenix, Arizona with an emphasis on customer comfort, simple pricing, and friendly faces.\r\n\r\nI am now 23 years old and my locations average $115,000 a month in revenue with record monthly sales of $158,000.\r\n\r\n*Photo of me at 19 in my first moving truck.*\r\n\r\n### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?\r\n\r\nI didn’t exactly come up with the initial idea for this company because this is a franchise which means for me that I license out the name “Skinny Wimp Moving”. However, because it was the first franchise location I was able to be in a prime decision-making seat and guinea pig for all ideas enabling me to test out theories on marketing and customer service which have no become standard across the brand.\r\n\r\nWe realized people simply don’t want a moving company that sucks. So we asked ourselves what can we do to make the stressful experience of moving suck a little less and the answers we came up with and stuck to were very common sense:\r\n\r\n- Friendly, clean cut movers.\r\n\r\n- Pricing structure that is a simple all-inclusive hourly rate with no hidden fees\r\n\r\n- Protecting every single piece of furniture.\r\n\r\n- Showing up on time \r\n\r\n- Always answering the phone\r\n\r\nDoing these simple things that our competitors were neglecting allowed us to grow 1400% in the first 15 months alone. Nearly everyone you talk to has had some form of poor moving experience to the point where it seems people were less looking for great movers and more trying to avoid nightmare movers creating a huge opportunity for us. Our service has been validated thousands of times over via the number of referrals from people whose friend told them they have to use us and hundreds of industry professionals like realtors and storage facilities who confidently refer us on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nMy expertise in the area is a bit of a funny story. I had moved from Minnesota to Arizona at 18 to start a pool cleaning business and while I was building this brand up large enough to sustain myself I worked part time at a moving company. After about two months when my business got busy enough I left the moving company.\r\n\r\nThen about 3 months later I was contacted by the owner of that moving company who was trying to sell, so I met with him and ended up buying the moving company I used to work for. I sunk every bit of my savings into the venture, basically going broke to make it work.\r\n\r\n### Describe the process of launching the business.\r\n\r\nInitially I used every dollar of my savings from my previous small businesses (around $18,000) to purchase insurance policies, equipment, and the down payments on the trucks.\r\n\r\nMy first clients were landed though storage facility referrals. I would go into these facilities and pitch how I would love to help anyone moving in or out and will basically do anything to get the job. I think they could tell I actually cared about how it would go and luckily a few gave me a shot. I still do this form of marketing to this day.\r\n\r\nI got my first few jobs quite quickly which meant I needed employees fast. What I did was go to the gym I worked out at and walked up to two random guys, started chatting, and basically convinced them to go a move with me the next day. So I invited them over to my house and showed them how to wrap up the furniture in my living room and what my expectations were. I’m honestly surprised it went smoothly looking back.\r\n\r\nI remember the very first move I did was for $950 and I was doing the math on if I did that 5 times a week that’s $4,750! Or Woah! What if I could do that 40 times a month! $38,000!\r\n\r\nFrom there, I used every dollar of incoming capital and deposits from upcoming booked moves to fund expenses. I went 28 months before receiving my first paycheck from this business due to re-investing every dollar back into the company. Luckily, I still owned PoolsMax which I used to pay my bills.\r\n\r\nWe grew fairly rapidly in the first few months as I was trying to do absolutely everything I could on jobs to provide the best possible customer services. Word of mouth referrals started rolling in.\r\n\r\nBefore starting I was concerned I would have a hard time managing people who were all older than me. I was pleasantly surprised that If I worked hard and treated my workers with respect they had no issues with working for me and many actually wanted to “the young guy” to succeed.\r\n\r\nI learned to do everything I can to make the right hire the first time. In the beginning I would try out any guy that seems decent. Now we may hire 1 out of 20 movers that come in to interview and we spend 5x the time training them. The right people make life and business much easier.\r\n\r\n### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?\r\n\r\nMarketing areas that have worked with their respective pros and cons:\r\n\r\n#### Google ads\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- Very targeted: It is possible to target very narrow demographics or even target groups by recent life events\r\n\r\n- Majority of people search Google first\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- Without a very large budget it is hard to make a big ripple. It seems more and more that the only way to have a huge effect is by having a huge budget.\r\n\r\n#### **Yelp ads**\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- Yelp has high consumer trust. Many people take Yelp’s recommendations as if it were a friend telling them.\r\n\r\n- If you can rank #1 in a city for a service you yield massive results. There doesn’t seem to be much of a long tail in that the top three or so results get all the business.\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- Predatory sales tactics: They are a bit harassing with their phone calls and claim it helps the page\r\n\r\n- Real reviews getting taken down. They have a recommendation system in which certain reviews become unviewable this tends to happen to at least 50% of reviews.\r\n\r\n- Contracts for ads. They don’t allow month to month deals.\r\n\r\n#### Groupon\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- Easy way to increase traffic if you are a new business\r\n\r\n- They will advertise for you: They run Google ads advertising your company.\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- They require a very low, somewhat un-sustainable price.\r\n\r\n#### In-Person Marketing (my favorite)\r\n\r\nI like to constantly think about what my competition isn’t doing. We live in a time where everyone’s marketing efforts consists of online ads and not very much in person marketing.\r\n\r\nIt’s a bit awkward at times and it takes a lot of effort but this is by far the best form of marketing I have utilized. I recently documented the process of me making a connections with 500 businesses that could potentially refer my business to their clients and it yielded me a reoccurring $30,000-$40,000 in additional sales per month. The entire process and results can be seen here.\r\n\r\n[YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYwiK6uBsZo)\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- Extremely effective\r\n\r\n- Cheap to do\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- A lot of effort\r\n\r\n### How are you doing today and what does the future look like?\r\n\r\nAt Skinny Wimp we are currently working on quality above all else. I have recently hired a quality control manager at my main Phoenix, Arizona location whose sole job is to ensure our movers are the best possible version of themselves.\r\n\r\nWe have build a weight rating system of 7 key metrics in which we grade our movers:\r\n\r\n- Professionalism\r\n\r\n- Timeliness\r\n\r\n- Protection of furniture\r\n\r\n- In-home protection\r\n\r\n- Friendliness\r\n\r\n- Safe driving\r\n\r\n- And a miscellaneous metric\r\n\r\n**Storage**\r\n\r\nWe are looking to expand to storage services within the year in order to better serve our customers with a one-stop shop. This is very capital intensive, though, so it is going to take a good bit of effort and planning. The ultimate goal is to build the storage business larger than the moving business. The margins in the storage industry are very high compared to the moving industry (around 30% for my moving companies and we are on the high end) compared to up to 60% for storage.\r\n\r\n**YouTube**\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have a YouTube channel in which I display my favorite things in life learning/self-improvement. I document a mix of business challenges/struggles (things like this [short case study on my experiment working 10 hours a day for 50 days straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPv-Wd20SFQ%26t=224s)) and personal goal setting as well. As the channel grows we are working on doing bigger and bigger projects like my upcoming documentary on my experience training for and running an ultra-marathon which will be released mid April. My goal of this channel is to lead by example to influence people to get out of their comfort zone, try new things, and build the best versions of themselves.. Not because it’s easy but because it’s hard.\r\n\r\n### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?\r\n\r\nMy biggest business mistake to date was expanding to new states hundreds of miles away too soon. We should have waited a little longer, built out systems and built up capital a little longer before taking on such an audacious project.\r\n\r\nThe farther away new locations are from the primary the harder it is to manage new locations. It ended up alright in the end but at the cost of extreme pressures and stress, it may have been a lesson I needed to learn because I tend to jump into things quickly.\r\n\r\nThe best decision I made was not paying myself for the first few years. By building up the bank account instead of buying myself fancy things I was able to much more easily get through some of the hard times that inevitably come up.\r\n\r\n### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?\r\n\r\nI am a huge consumer of educational material.\r\n\r\nMy favorite books of the last year are:\r\n\r\nNever Split the Difference which helped me massively in conflict negotiation and interpersonal conflicts\r\n\r\nPoor Charlie’s Almanac because it inspired me further to become a lifelong learner and the benefits of such a thing\r\n\r\nIdea Man which ada he impact on me. I never realized the masie effect Paul Allen had on the world and it made me realize that is exactly what I ultimately want in life, to positively affect the greatest number of people.\r\n\r\nMy favorite podcasts are How I Built This and The Sweaty Startup for business stories and lessons and Mindscape for all things science.\r\n\r\n### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?\r\n\r\nTwo of the top questions I get asked from young entrepreneurs are “When should I start?” and “How should I market?” They are very good questions and here is how I would address them:\r\n\r\n*When should I start?*\r\n\r\n**Just Go**\r\n\r\n- That perfect time you’ve been waiting for to start isn’t going to come.\r\n\r\n- Your product/service will never be perfect before launch. \r\n\r\n- You probably ever have the ideal amount of time, energy, or money it takes to launch perfectly. \r\n\r\n**Things You Should Focus on Instead of When to Start**\r\n\r\n*How can I get my product/service out there as quickly and efficiently as possible?*\r\n\r\nThink in terms of what your Minimum Viable Product is. This is a concept developed by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup and a technique that has ben used to start some of today’s biggest businesses such as Twitter, dropbox, Groupon, and zappos. This concept in its simplest form is figuring out what the bare minimum is to launch your business and provide value, then do it. Launching your MVP prevents you from wasting resources on things that may end up having no value. The last thing you want to do is spend years planning and creating this grand plan only to find after launch that customers only care about one portion of your idea.\r\n\r\nIt’s easier to learn what the market likes than it is to guess what the market wants.\r\n\r\nThis doesn’t just apply to tech companies.\r\n\r\nLet's say you want to start a landscaping business. Yes it would be wonderful to buy a brand new truck $50,000 and mower $1,500 and tools $1000 and website $1000 and get an office space for $2000 down. But let’s break down what you truly need to start. An old vehicle, push mower, and business cards will do just fine, $4000.\r\n\r\nNow some of you might be thinking I don’t even have $4k so I can’t start a business. So let’s go one step further and limit our service line down to things done by hand. Shoveling, raking, and pulling weeds. What does it really take to start that business? Used hand tools for $70 and business cards for $30. You don’t even need a vehicle, you can walk yard to yard if you have to. So we just took our faraway goal of saving $55,500 to start the perfect landscaping business to a $100 business that we can start today and begin making money.\r\n\r\nThe true beauty of this is now that it costs you less than $100 to start a business you can try it and if it doesn’t work or you don’t like it move on to the next $100 start-up\r\n\r\nYou may be thinking “How am I ever going to grow or make real money if I’m raking a yard myself for $20 a house when I could never do more than 50 houses?” and that brings us to next point of doing things that don’t scale. This is a famous philosophy by Paul Graham of Y Combinator. It basically means it is *okay* and actually a good strategy to do things now that won’t work when your business grows to the next stage. That is because without it your business may never even grow to the next stage!\r\n\r\nWorry about how you’ll handle 60 accounts when you’re already at 50 accounts and earning the income of 50 accounts, not when you’re at 0\r\n\r\n**Don’t Assume You Have a Lot of Time**\r\n\r\nWhatever age you are, seize every day. Every single day that you’re not out progressing yourself or your business is a day lost.\r\n\r\nLet’s say on days you work you make $100 and you could have worked today but you took the day off. You need to think in terms that you didn’t just miss out on $100 but you actually lost $100. And we can take that one step further. Let's say every $100 you invest back in your business returns you 10% a year so that’s:\r\n\r\n- $110 after year 1. \r\n\r\n- $161.05 after year 5. \r\n\r\n- $259.37 after year 10.        \r\n\r\n- $672.72 after year 20. \r\n\r\nIt gets much crazier after that. The point is today ALWAYS matters and the sooner you start the sooner you can use this compounding to your advantage not your disadvantage.\r\n\r\n**How Should I Market?**\r\n\r\nThis is obviously something that varies quite a bit from industry to industry but when approaching marketing I like to go back to the thought process of “What can I do today?” and “How many things can I try for the lowest cost possible?”. If you have a low amount of cash to spend your greatest asset will be willpower and getting face to face with as many people related to your business as possible.\r\n\r\n**Knock Twice Marketing**\r\n\r\nThis is a type of marketing I find extremely effective. It is based on the premise you should never try to sell to someone just once.\r\n\r\nMarketing when you first start a business is hard. *Think persistence*. People admire persistence especially from young people because it’s a trait they hope other’s see in them.\r\n\r\n- **Most**  people will never ask for your business because of the fear of rejection. \r\n\r\n- **Some**  people will knock once or ask for your business once. \r\n\r\n- **Almost**  no one will keep knocking after the first no. Now I’m not saying to be an overly aggressive salesman I’m talking about just a friendly “Hey I’m still here and I would love to have your business”\r\n\r\nThink about what it takes you to use a business. Are you going to use the company that you saw one advertisement for or the one you see and are reminded of every week?\r\n\r\nThe power of persistence has helped me more times than I can count. And a perfect example is for one of my businesses I do cold pitches to businesses or people who can refer my business to their clients. I walked into a store and gave my pitch to the assistant manager who said “Sounds great, my manager deals with vendors, I’ll make sure she contacts you.” so I leave and three days later no response from the manager.. I type up a friendly email about how I talked to her assistant manager and what I am hoping to get accomplished . A week later, no response. I go back to the same store and the manager is there, I mention who I am, that I talked to her assistant and that I was hoping to become a vendor. That’s when she remembered my email and said “Oh yeah, I was going to respond to your email but we’ve been swamped so I haven’t been able to yet, I apologize for that! I saw you have great reviews and think you’d be a good fit” she then pulled out the form to become a vendor and I filled it out on the spot. I could have quit any step of that process and wouldn’t currently be receiving income from that contract.\r\n\r\n**In Conclusion**\r\n\r\nStart now, put yourself out there and ask for their business. Sure be conscious that you may get rejected but don’t be afraid to ask more than once. It won’t work every time but it will work 100% more than not trying at all.\r\n\r\n### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?\r\n\r\nI don’t have a specific position I currently need filled but I would never turn down the opportunity to speak with a passionate, skilled person who may be able to help out my company.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I mentioned I am looking to get into the storage business, so I am the process of looking for investors for this next step.\r\n\r\nWe are always looking for new movers/crew leads to join us and rise up the ranks.\r\n\r\n### Where can we go to learn more?\r\n\r\nPersonal\r\n\r\n- [https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher](https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher)\r\n\r\n- [https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/](https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/)\r\n\r\n- becauseitshard@gmail.com\r\n\r\nBusiness\r\n\r\n- [www.skinnywimpmoving.com](http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com)\r\n\r\n- [www.poolsmax.com](http://www.poolsmax.com)\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments, drop a comment below!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLiked this text interview?

Who are you and what business did you start?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My name is Max Maher I am a serial entrepreneur, lifelong learner, and a founder of Skinny Wimp Moving!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting out, I formed a small landscaping company at 13, a sports supplement company at 16, then a pool service company, called &lt;a href=\"http://poolsmax.com/\"&gt;PoolsMax&lt;/a&gt; at 18. The amalgamation of these businesses along with ruthlessly saving enabled me to purchase existing moving trucks and warehouse space of an unprofitable moving company which became the first Skinny Wimp Moving Co franchise when I was 19.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com/\"&gt;Skinny Wimp Moving&lt;/a&gt; provides household and commercial moving services based out of Phoenix, Arizona with an emphasis on customer comfort, simple pricing, and friendly faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am now 23 years old and my locations average $115,000 a month in revenue with record monthly sales of $158,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo of me at 19 in my first moving truck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t exactly come up with the initial idea for this company because this is a franchise which means for me that I license out the name “Skinny Wimp Moving”. However, because it was the first franchise location I was able to be in a prime decision-making seat and guinea pig for all ideas enabling me to test out theories on marketing and customer service which have no become standard across the brand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We realized people simply don’t want a moving company that sucks. So we asked ourselves what can we do to make the stressful experience of moving suck a little less and the answers we came up with and stuck to were very common sense:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendly, clean cut movers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing structure that is a simple all-inclusive hourly rate with no hidden fees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting every single piece of furniture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showing up on time &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always answering the phone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing these simple things that our competitors were neglecting allowed us to grow 1400% in the first 15 months alone. Nearly everyone you talk to has had some form of poor moving experience to the point where it seems people were less looking for great movers and more trying to avoid nightmare movers creating a huge opportunity for us. Our service has been validated thousands of times over via the number of referrals from people whose friend told them they have to use us and hundreds of industry professionals like realtors and storage facilities who confidently refer us on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My expertise in the area is a bit of a funny story. I had moved from Minnesota to Arizona at 18 to start a pool cleaning business and while I was building this brand up large enough to sustain myself I worked part time at a moving company. After about two months when my business got busy enough I left the moving company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then about 3 months later I was contacted by the owner of that moving company who was trying to sell, so I met with him and ended up buying the moving company I used to work for. I sunk every bit of my savings into the venture, basically going broke to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Describe the process of launching the business.&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially I used every dollar of my savings from my previous small businesses (around $18,000) to purchase insurance policies, equipment, and the down payments on the trucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first clients were landed though storage facility referrals. I would go into these facilities and pitch how I would love to help anyone moving in or out and will basically do anything to get the job. I think they could tell I actually cared about how it would go and luckily a few gave me a shot. I still do this form of marketing to this day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got my first few jobs quite quickly which meant I needed employees fast. What I did was go to the gym I worked out at and walked up to two random guys, started chatting, and basically convinced them to go a move with me the next day. So I invited them over to my house and showed them how to wrap up the furniture in my living room and what my expectations were. I’m honestly surprised it went smoothly looking back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember the very first move I did was for $950 and I was doing the math on if I did that 5 times a week that’s $4,750! Or Woah! What if I could do that 40 times a month! $38,000!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there, I used every dollar of incoming capital and deposits from upcoming booked moves to fund expenses. I went 28 months before receiving my first paycheck from this business due to re-investing every dollar back into the company. Luckily, I still owned PoolsMax which I used to pay my bills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We grew fairly rapidly in the first few months as I was trying to do absolutely everything I could on jobs to provide the best possible customer services. Word of mouth referrals started rolling in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before starting I was concerned I would have a hard time managing people who were all older than me. I was pleasantly surprised that If I worked hard and treated my workers with respect they had no issues with working for me and many actually wanted to “the young guy” to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned to do everything I can to make the right hire the first time. In the beginning I would try out any guy that seems decent. Now we may hire 1 out of 20 movers that come in to interview and we spend 5x the time training them. The right people make life and business much easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marketing areas that have worked with their respective pros and cons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Google ads&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very targeted: It is possible to target very narrow demographics or even target groups by recent life events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Majority of people search Google first&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Without a very large budget it is hard to make a big ripple. It seems more and more that the only way to have a huge effect is by having a huge budget.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yelp ads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yelp has high consumer trust. Many people take Yelp’s recommendations as if it were a friend telling them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can rank #1 in a city for a service you yield massive results. There doesn’t seem to be much of a long tail in that the top three or so results get all the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predatory sales tactics: They are a bit harassing with their phone calls and claim it helps the page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real reviews getting taken down. They have a recommendation system in which certain reviews become unviewable this tends to happen to at least 50% of reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contracts for ads. They don’t allow month to month deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Groupon&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy way to increase traffic if you are a new business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will advertise for you: They run Google ads advertising your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They require a very low, somewhat un-sustainable price.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;In-Person Marketing (my favorite)&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to constantly think about what my competition isn’t doing. We live in a time where everyone’s marketing efforts consists of online ads and not very much in person marketing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit awkward at times and it takes a lot of effort but this is by far the best form of marketing I have utilized. I recently documented the process of me making a connections with 500 businesses that could potentially refer my business to their clients and it yielded me a reoccurring $30,000-$40,000 in additional sales per month. The entire process and results can be seen here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYwiK6uBsZo\"&gt;YT video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extremely effective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheap to do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A lot of effort&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How are you doing today and what does the future look like?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At Skinny Wimp we are currently working on quality above all else. I have recently hired a quality control manager at my main Phoenix, Arizona location whose sole job is to ensure our movers are the best possible version of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have build a weight rating system of 7 key metrics in which we grade our movers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professionalism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timeliness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection of furniture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-home protection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendliness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe driving&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a miscellaneous metric&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking to expand to storage services within the year in order to better serve our customers with a one-stop shop. This is very capital intensive, though, so it is going to take a good bit of effort and planning. The ultimate goal is to build the storage business larger than the moving business. The margins in the storage industry are very high compared to the moving industry (around 30% for my moving companies and we are on the high end) compared to up to 60% for storage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have a YouTube channel in which I display my favorite things in life learning/self-improvement. I document a mix of business challenges/struggles (things like this &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPv-Wd20SFQ%26t=224s\"&gt;short case study on my experiment working 10 hours a day for 50 days straight&lt;/a&gt;) and personal goal setting as well. As the channel grows we are working on doing bigger and bigger projects like my upcoming documentary on my experience training for and running an ultra-marathon which will be released mid April. My goal of this channel is to lead by example to influence people to get out of their comfort zone, try new things, and build the best versions of themselves.. Not because it’s easy but because it’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My biggest business mistake to date was expanding to new states hundreds of miles away too soon. We should have waited a little longer, built out systems and built up capital a little longer before taking on such an audacious project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The farther away new locations are from the primary the harder it is to manage new locations. It ended up alright in the end but at the cost of extreme pressures and stress, it may have been a lesson I needed to learn because I tend to jump into things quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best decision I made was not paying myself for the first few years. By building up the bank account instead of buying myself fancy things I was able to much more easily get through some of the hard times that inevitably come up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a huge consumer of educational material.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite books of the last year are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never Split the Difference which helped me massively in conflict negotiation and interpersonal conflicts&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poor Charlie’s Almanac because it inspired me further to become a lifelong learner and the benefits of such a thing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idea Man which ada he impact on me. I never realized the masie effect Paul Allen had on the world and it made me realize that is exactly what I ultimately want in life, to positively affect the greatest number of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite podcasts are How I Built This and The Sweaty Startup for business stories and lessons and Mindscape for all things science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two of the top questions I get asked from young entrepreneurs are “When should I start?” and “How should I market?” They are very good questions and here is how I would address them:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When should I start?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That perfect time you’ve been waiting for to start isn’t going to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your product/service will never be perfect before launch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably ever have the ideal amount of time, energy, or money it takes to launch perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things You Should Focus on Instead of When to Start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can I get my product/service out there as quickly and efficiently as possible?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think in terms of what your Minimum Viable Product is. This is a concept developed by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup and a technique that has ben used to start some of today’s biggest businesses such as Twitter, dropbox, Groupon, and zappos. This concept in its simplest form is figuring out what the bare minimum is to launch your business and provide value, then do it. Launching your MVP prevents you from wasting resources on things that may end up having no value. The last thing you want to do is spend years planning and creating this grand plan only to find after launch that customers only care about one portion of your idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s easier to learn what the market likes than it is to guess what the market wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t just apply to tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you want to start a landscaping business. Yes it would be wonderful to buy a brand new truck $50,000 and mower $1,500 and tools $1000 and website $1000 and get an office space for $2000 down. But let’s break down what you truly need to start. An old vehicle, push mower, and business cards will do just fine, $4000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now some of you might be thinking I don’t even have $4k so I can’t start a business. So let’s go one step further and limit our service line down to things done by hand. Shoveling, raking, and pulling weeds. What does it really take to start that business? Used hand tools for $70 and business cards for $30. You don’t even need a vehicle, you can walk yard to yard if you have to. So we just took our faraway goal of saving $55,500 to start the perfect landscaping business to a $100 business that we can start today and begin making money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The true beauty of this is now that it costs you less than $100 to start a business you can try it and if it doesn’t work or you don’t like it move on to the next $100 start-up&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may be thinking “How am I ever going to grow or make real money if I’m raking a yard myself for $20 a house when I could never do more than 50 houses?” and that brings us to next point of doing things that don’t scale. This is a famous philosophy by Paul Graham of Y Combinator. It basically means it is &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; and actually a good strategy to do things now that won’t work when your business grows to the next stage. That is because without it your business may never even grow to the next stage!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worry about how you’ll handle 60 accounts when you’re already at 50 accounts and earning the income of 50 accounts, not when you’re at 0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Assume You Have a Lot of Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever age you are, seize every day. Every single day that you’re not out progressing yourself or your business is a day lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s say on days you work you make $100 and you could have worked today but you took the day off. You need to think in terms that you didn’t just miss out on $100 but you actually lost $100. And we can take that one step further. Let&amp;#39;s say every $100 you invest back in your business returns you 10% a year so that’s:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$110 after year 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$161.05 after year 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$259.37 after year 10.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$672.72 after year 20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets much crazier after that. The point is today ALWAYS matters and the sooner you start the sooner you can use this compounding to your advantage not your disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Should I Market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is obviously something that varies quite a bit from industry to industry but when approaching marketing I like to go back to the thought process of “What can I do today?” and “How many things can I try for the lowest cost possible?”. If you have a low amount of cash to spend your greatest asset will be willpower and getting face to face with as many people related to your business as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knock Twice Marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a type of marketing I find extremely effective. It is based on the premise you should never try to sell to someone just once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marketing when you first start a business is hard. &lt;em&gt;Think persistence&lt;/em&gt;. People admire persistence especially from young people because it’s a trait they hope other’s see in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most&lt;/strong&gt;  people will never ask for your business because of the fear of rejection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some&lt;/strong&gt;  people will knock once or ask for your business once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost&lt;/strong&gt;  no one will keep knocking after the first no. Now I’m not saying to be an overly aggressive salesman I’m talking about just a friendly “Hey I’m still here and I would love to have your business”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about what it takes you to use a business. Are you going to use the company that you saw one advertisement for or the one you see and are reminded of every week?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The power of persistence has helped me more times than I can count. And a perfect example is for one of my businesses I do cold pitches to businesses or people who can refer my business to their clients. I walked into a store and gave my pitch to the assistant manager who said “Sounds great, my manager deals with vendors, I’ll make sure she contacts you.” so I leave and three days later no response from the manager.. I type up a friendly email about how I talked to her assistant manager and what I am hoping to get accomplished . A week later, no response. I go back to the same store and the manager is there, I mention who I am, that I talked to her assistant and that I was hoping to become a vendor. That’s when she remembered my email and said “Oh yeah, I was going to respond to your email but we’ve been swamped so I haven’t been able to yet, I apologize for that! I saw you have great reviews and think you’d be a good fit” she then pulled out the form to become a vendor and I filled it out on the spot. I could have quit any step of that process and wouldn’t currently be receiving income from that contract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start now, put yourself out there and ask for their business. Sure be conscious that you may get rejected but don’t be afraid to ask more than once. It won’t work every time but it will work 100% more than not trying at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a specific position I currently need filled but I would never turn down the opportunity to speak with a passionate, skilled person who may be able to help out my company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, as I mentioned I am looking to get into the storage business, so I am the process of looking for investors for this next step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are always looking for new movers/crew leads to join us and rise up the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Where can we go to learn more?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personal&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/\"&gt;https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:becauseitshard@gmail.com\"&gt;becauseitshard@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Business&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com\"&gt;www.skinnywimpmoving.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.poolsmax.com\"&gt;www.poolsmax.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or comments, drop a comment below!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Liked this text interview?

          "selftext": "Hey - Pat from [StarterStory.com](https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.\r\n\r\nToday's interview is with Max Maher of [Skinny Wimp Moving](https://www.skinnywimpmoving.com), a company that offers household moving services.\r\n\r\n**Some stats:**\r\n\r\n* Product: Household moving services.\r\n* Revenue/mo: $115,000\r\n* Started: November 2015\r\n* Location: Chandler\r\n* Founders: 2\r\n* Employees: 40\r\n\r\n### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start?\r\n\r\nMy name is Max Maher I am a serial entrepreneur, lifelong learner, and a founder of Skinny Wimp Moving!\r\n\r\nStarting out, I formed a small landscaping company at 13, a sports supplement company at 16, then a pool service company, called [PoolsMax](http://poolsmax.com/) at 18. The amalgamation of these businesses along with ruthlessly saving enabled me to purchase existing moving trucks and warehouse space of an unprofitable moving company which became the first Skinny Wimp Moving Co franchise when I was 19.\r\n\r\n[Skinny Wimp Moving](http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com/) provides household and commercial moving services based out of Phoenix, Arizona with an emphasis on customer comfort, simple pricing, and friendly faces.\r\n\r\nI am now 23 years old and my locations average $115,000 a month in revenue with record monthly sales of $158,000.\r\n\r\n*Photo of me at 19 in my first moving truck.*\r\n\r\n### What's your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?\r\n\r\nI didn’t exactly come up with the initial idea for this company because this is a franchise which means for me that I license out the name “Skinny Wimp Moving”. However, because it was the first franchise location I was able to be in a prime decision-making seat and guinea pig for all ideas enabling me to test out theories on marketing and customer service which have no become standard across the brand.\r\n\r\nWe realized people simply don’t want a moving company that sucks. So we asked ourselves what can we do to make the stressful experience of moving suck a little less and the answers we came up with and stuck to were very common sense:\r\n\r\n- Friendly, clean cut movers.\r\n\r\n- Pricing structure that is a simple all-inclusive hourly rate with no hidden fees\r\n\r\n- Protecting every single piece of furniture.\r\n\r\n- Showing up on time \r\n\r\n- Always answering the phone\r\n\r\nDoing these simple things that our competitors were neglecting allowed us to grow 1400% in the first 15 months alone. Nearly everyone you talk to has had some form of poor moving experience to the point where it seems people were less looking for great movers and more trying to avoid nightmare movers creating a huge opportunity for us. Our service has been validated thousands of times over via the number of referrals from people whose friend told them they have to use us and hundreds of industry professionals like realtors and storage facilities who confidently refer us on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nMy expertise in the area is a bit of a funny story. I had moved from Minnesota to Arizona at 18 to start a pool cleaning business and while I was building this brand up large enough to sustain myself I worked part time at a moving company. After about two months when my business got busy enough I left the moving company.\r\n\r\nThen about 3 months later I was contacted by the owner of that moving company who was trying to sell, so I met with him and ended up buying the moving company I used to work for. I sunk every bit of my savings into the venture, basically going broke to make it work.\r\n\r\n### Describe the process of launching the business.\r\n\r\nInitially I used every dollar of my savings from my previous small businesses (around $18,000) to purchase insurance policies, equipment, and the down payments on the trucks.\r\n\r\nMy first clients were landed though storage facility referrals. I would go into these facilities and pitch how I would love to help anyone moving in or out and will basically do anything to get the job. I think they could tell I actually cared about how it would go and luckily a few gave me a shot. I still do this form of marketing to this day.\r\n\r\nI got my first few jobs quite quickly which meant I needed employees fast. What I did was go to the gym I worked out at and walked up to two random guys, started chatting, and basically convinced them to go a move with me the next day. So I invited them over to my house and showed them how to wrap up the furniture in my living room and what my expectations were. I’m honestly surprised it went smoothly looking back.\r\n\r\nI remember the very first move I did was for $950 and I was doing the math on if I did that 5 times a week that’s $4,750! Or Woah! What if I could do that 40 times a month! $38,000!\r\n\r\nFrom there, I used every dollar of incoming capital and deposits from upcoming booked moves to fund expenses. I went 28 months before receiving my first paycheck from this business due to re-investing every dollar back into the company. Luckily, I still owned PoolsMax which I used to pay my bills.\r\n\r\nWe grew fairly rapidly in the first few months as I was trying to do absolutely everything I could on jobs to provide the best possible customer services. Word of mouth referrals started rolling in.\r\n\r\nBefore starting I was concerned I would have a hard time managing people who were all older than me. I was pleasantly surprised that If I worked hard and treated my workers with respect they had no issues with working for me and many actually wanted to “the young guy” to succeed.\r\n\r\nI learned to do everything I can to make the right hire the first time. In the beginning I would try out any guy that seems decent. Now we may hire 1 out of 20 movers that come in to interview and we spend 5x the time training them. The right people make life and business much easier.\r\n\r\n### Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?\r\n\r\nMarketing areas that have worked with their respective pros and cons:\r\n\r\n#### Google ads\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- Very targeted: It is possible to target very narrow demographics or even target groups by recent life events\r\n\r\n- Majority of people search Google first\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- Without a very large budget it is hard to make a big ripple. It seems more and more that the only way to have a huge effect is by having a huge budget.\r\n\r\n#### **Yelp ads**\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- Yelp has high consumer trust. Many people take Yelp’s recommendations as if it were a friend telling them.\r\n\r\n- If you can rank #1 in a city for a service you yield massive results. There doesn’t seem to be much of a long tail in that the top three or so results get all the business.\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- Predatory sales tactics: They are a bit harassing with their phone calls and claim it helps the page\r\n\r\n- Real reviews getting taken down. They have a recommendation system in which certain reviews become unviewable this tends to happen to at least 50% of reviews.\r\n\r\n- Contracts for ads. They don’t allow month to month deals.\r\n\r\n#### Groupon\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- Easy way to increase traffic if you are a new business\r\n\r\n- They will advertise for you: They run Google ads advertising your company.\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- They require a very low, somewhat un-sustainable price.\r\n\r\n#### In-Person Marketing (my favorite)\r\n\r\nI like to constantly think about what my competition isn’t doing. We live in a time where everyone’s marketing efforts consists of online ads and not very much in person marketing.\r\n\r\nIt’s a bit awkward at times and it takes a lot of effort but this is by far the best form of marketing I have utilized. I recently documented the process of me making a connections with 500 businesses that could potentially refer my business to their clients and it yielded me a reoccurring $30,000-$40,000 in additional sales per month. The entire process and results can be seen here.\r\n\r\n[YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYwiK6uBsZo)\r\n\r\n**Pros:**\r\n\r\n- Extremely effective\r\n\r\n- Cheap to do\r\n\r\n**Cons:**\r\n\r\n- A lot of effort\r\n\r\n### How are you doing today and what does the future look like?\r\n\r\nAt Skinny Wimp we are currently working on quality above all else. I have recently hired a quality control manager at my main Phoenix, Arizona location whose sole job is to ensure our movers are the best possible version of themselves.\r\n\r\nWe have build a weight rating system of 7 key metrics in which we grade our movers:\r\n\r\n- Professionalism\r\n\r\n- Timeliness\r\n\r\n- Protection of furniture\r\n\r\n- In-home protection\r\n\r\n- Friendliness\r\n\r\n- Safe driving\r\n\r\n- And a miscellaneous metric\r\n\r\n**Storage**\r\n\r\nWe are looking to expand to storage services within the year in order to better serve our customers with a one-stop shop. This is very capital intensive, though, so it is going to take a good bit of effort and planning. The ultimate goal is to build the storage business larger than the moving business. The margins in the storage industry are very high compared to the moving industry (around 30% for my moving companies and we are on the high end) compared to up to 60% for storage.\r\n\r\n**YouTube**\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have a YouTube channel in which I display my favorite things in life learning/self-improvement. I document a mix of business challenges/struggles (things like this [short case study on my experiment working 10 hours a day for 50 days straight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPv-Wd20SFQ%26t=224s)) and personal goal setting as well. As the channel grows we are working on doing bigger and bigger projects like my upcoming documentary on my experience training for and running an ultra-marathon which will be released mid April. My goal of this channel is to lead by example to influence people to get out of their comfort zone, try new things, and build the best versions of themselves.. Not because it’s easy but because it’s hard.\r\n\r\n### Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?\r\n\r\nMy biggest business mistake to date was expanding to new states hundreds of miles away too soon. We should have waited a little longer, built out systems and built up capital a little longer before taking on such an audacious project.\r\n\r\nThe farther away new locations are from the primary the harder it is to manage new locations. It ended up alright in the end but at the cost of extreme pressures and stress, it may have been a lesson I needed to learn because I tend to jump into things quickly.\r\n\r\nThe best decision I made was not paying myself for the first few years. By building up the bank account instead of buying myself fancy things I was able to much more easily get through some of the hard times that inevitably come up.\r\n\r\n### What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?\r\n\r\nI am a huge consumer of educational material.\r\n\r\nMy favorite books of the last year are:\r\n\r\nNever Split the Difference which helped me massively in conflict negotiation and interpersonal conflicts\r\n\r\nPoor Charlie’s Almanac because it inspired me further to become a lifelong learner and the benefits of such a thing\r\n\r\nIdea Man which ada he impact on me. I never realized the masie effect Paul Allen had on the world and it made me realize that is exactly what I ultimately want in life, to positively affect the greatest number of people.\r\n\r\nMy favorite podcasts are How I Built This and The Sweaty Startup for business stories and lessons and Mindscape for all things science.\r\n\r\n### Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?\r\n\r\nTwo of the top questions I get asked from young entrepreneurs are “When should I start?” and “How should I market?” They are very good questions and here is how I would address them:\r\n\r\n*When should I start?*\r\n\r\n**Just Go**\r\n\r\n- That perfect time you’ve been waiting for to start isn’t going to come.\r\n\r\n- Your product/service will never be perfect before launch. \r\n\r\n- You probably ever have the ideal amount of time, energy, or money it takes to launch perfectly. \r\n\r\n**Things You Should Focus on Instead of When to Start**\r\n\r\n*How can I get my product/service out there as quickly and efficiently as possible?*\r\n\r\nThink in terms of what your Minimum Viable Product is. This is a concept developed by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup and a technique that has ben used to start some of today’s biggest businesses such as Twitter, dropbox, Groupon, and zappos. This concept in its simplest form is figuring out what the bare minimum is to launch your business and provide value, then do it. Launching your MVP prevents you from wasting resources on things that may end up having no value. The last thing you want to do is spend years planning and creating this grand plan only to find after launch that customers only care about one portion of your idea.\r\n\r\nIt’s easier to learn what the market likes than it is to guess what the market wants.\r\n\r\nThis doesn’t just apply to tech companies.\r\n\r\nLet's say you want to start a landscaping business. Yes it would be wonderful to buy a brand new truck $50,000 and mower $1,500 and tools $1000 and website $1000 and get an office space for $2000 down. But let’s break down what you truly need to start. An old vehicle, push mower, and business cards will do just fine, $4000.\r\n\r\nNow some of you might be thinking I don’t even have $4k so I can’t start a business. So let’s go one step further and limit our service line down to things done by hand. Shoveling, raking, and pulling weeds. What does it really take to start that business? Used hand tools for $70 and business cards for $30. You don’t even need a vehicle, you can walk yard to yard if you have to. So we just took our faraway goal of saving $55,500 to start the perfect landscaping business to a $100 business that we can start today and begin making money.\r\n\r\nThe true beauty of this is now that it costs you less than $100 to start a business you can try it and if it doesn’t work or you don’t like it move on to the next $100 start-up\r\n\r\nYou may be thinking “How am I ever going to grow or make real money if I’m raking a yard myself for $20 a house when I could never do more than 50 houses?” and that brings us to next point of doing things that don’t scale. This is a famous philosophy by Paul Graham of Y Combinator. It basically means it is *okay* and actually a good strategy to do things now that won’t work when your business grows to the next stage. That is because without it your business may never even grow to the next stage!\r\n\r\nWorry about how you’ll handle 60 accounts when you’re already at 50 accounts and earning the income of 50 accounts, not when you’re at 0\r\n\r\n**Don’t Assume You Have a Lot of Time**\r\n\r\nWhatever age you are, seize every day. Every single day that you’re not out progressing yourself or your business is a day lost.\r\n\r\nLet’s say on days you work you make $100 and you could have worked today but you took the day off. You need to think in terms that you didn’t just miss out on $100 but you actually lost $100. And we can take that one step further. Let's say every $100 you invest back in your business returns you 10% a year so that’s:\r\n\r\n- $110 after year 1. \r\n\r\n- $161.05 after year 5. \r\n\r\n- $259.37 after year 10.        \r\n\r\n- $672.72 after year 20. \r\n\r\nIt gets much crazier after that. The point is today ALWAYS matters and the sooner you start the sooner you can use this compounding to your advantage not your disadvantage.\r\n\r\n**How Should I Market?**\r\n\r\nThis is obviously something that varies quite a bit from industry to industry but when approaching marketing I like to go back to the thought process of “What can I do today?” and “How many things can I try for the lowest cost possible?”. If you have a low amount of cash to spend your greatest asset will be willpower and getting face to face with as many people related to your business as possible.\r\n\r\n**Knock Twice Marketing**\r\n\r\nThis is a type of marketing I find extremely effective. It is based on the premise you should never try to sell to someone just once.\r\n\r\nMarketing when you first start a business is hard. *Think persistence*. People admire persistence especially from young people because it’s a trait they hope other’s see in them.\r\n\r\n- **Most**  people will never ask for your business because of the fear of rejection. \r\n\r\n- **Some**  people will knock once or ask for your business once. \r\n\r\n- **Almost**  no one will keep knocking after the first no. Now I’m not saying to be an overly aggressive salesman I’m talking about just a friendly “Hey I’m still here and I would love to have your business”\r\n\r\nThink about what it takes you to use a business. Are you going to use the company that you saw one advertisement for or the one you see and are reminded of every week?\r\n\r\nThe power of persistence has helped me more times than I can count. And a perfect example is for one of my businesses I do cold pitches to businesses or people who can refer my business to their clients. I walked into a store and gave my pitch to the assistant manager who said “Sounds great, my manager deals with vendors, I’ll make sure she contacts you.” so I leave and three days later no response from the manager.. I type up a friendly email about how I talked to her assistant manager and what I am hoping to get accomplished . A week later, no response. I go back to the same store and the manager is there, I mention who I am, that I talked to her assistant and that I was hoping to become a vendor. That’s when she remembered my email and said “Oh yeah, I was going to respond to your email but we’ve been swamped so I haven’t been able to yet, I apologize for that! I saw you have great reviews and think you’d be a good fit” she then pulled out the form to become a vendor and I filled it out on the spot. I could have quit any step of that process and wouldn’t currently be receiving income from that contract.\r\n\r\n**In Conclusion**\r\n\r\nStart now, put yourself out there and ask for their business. Sure be conscious that you may get rejected but don’t be afraid to ask more than once. It won’t work every time but it will work 100% more than not trying at all.\r\n\r\n### Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?\r\n\r\nI don’t have a specific position I currently need filled but I would never turn down the opportunity to speak with a passionate, skilled person who may be able to help out my company.\r\n\r\nHowever, as I mentioned I am looking to get into the storage business, so I am the process of looking for investors for this next step.\r\n\r\nWe are always looking for new movers/crew leads to join us and rise up the ranks.\r\n\r\n### Where can we go to learn more?\r\n\r\nPersonal\r\n\r\n- [https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher](https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher)\r\n\r\n- [https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/](https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/)\r\n\r\n- becauseitshard@gmail.com\r\n\r\nBusiness\r\n\r\n- [www.skinnywimpmoving.com](http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com)\r\n\r\n- [www.poolsmax.com](http://www.poolsmax.com)\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or comments, drop a comment below!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLiked this text interview?

Who are you and what business did you start?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My name is Max Maher I am a serial entrepreneur, lifelong learner, and a founder of Skinny Wimp Moving!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Starting out, I formed a small landscaping company at 13, a sports supplement company at 16, then a pool service company, called &lt;a href=\"http://poolsmax.com/\"&gt;PoolsMax&lt;/a&gt; at 18. The amalgamation of these businesses along with ruthlessly saving enabled me to purchase existing moving trucks and warehouse space of an unprofitable moving company which became the first Skinny Wimp Moving Co franchise when I was 19.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com/\"&gt;Skinny Wimp Moving&lt;/a&gt; provides household and commercial moving services based out of Phoenix, Arizona with an emphasis on customer comfort, simple pricing, and friendly faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am now 23 years old and my locations average $115,000 a month in revenue with record monthly sales of $158,000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo of me at 19 in my first moving truck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#39;s your backstory and how did you come up with the idea?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn’t exactly come up with the initial idea for this company because this is a franchise which means for me that I license out the name “Skinny Wimp Moving”. However, because it was the first franchise location I was able to be in a prime decision-making seat and guinea pig for all ideas enabling me to test out theories on marketing and customer service which have no become standard across the brand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We realized people simply don’t want a moving company that sucks. So we asked ourselves what can we do to make the stressful experience of moving suck a little less and the answers we came up with and stuck to were very common sense:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendly, clean cut movers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing structure that is a simple all-inclusive hourly rate with no hidden fees&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protecting every single piece of furniture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Showing up on time &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Always answering the phone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Doing these simple things that our competitors were neglecting allowed us to grow 1400% in the first 15 months alone. Nearly everyone you talk to has had some form of poor moving experience to the point where it seems people were less looking for great movers and more trying to avoid nightmare movers creating a huge opportunity for us. Our service has been validated thousands of times over via the number of referrals from people whose friend told them they have to use us and hundreds of industry professionals like realtors and storage facilities who confidently refer us on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My expertise in the area is a bit of a funny story. I had moved from Minnesota to Arizona at 18 to start a pool cleaning business and while I was building this brand up large enough to sustain myself I worked part time at a moving company. After about two months when my business got busy enough I left the moving company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then about 3 months later I was contacted by the owner of that moving company who was trying to sell, so I met with him and ended up buying the moving company I used to work for. I sunk every bit of my savings into the venture, basically going broke to make it work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Describe the process of launching the business.&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Initially I used every dollar of my savings from my previous small businesses (around $18,000) to purchase insurance policies, equipment, and the down payments on the trucks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first clients were landed though storage facility referrals. I would go into these facilities and pitch how I would love to help anyone moving in or out and will basically do anything to get the job. I think they could tell I actually cared about how it would go and luckily a few gave me a shot. I still do this form of marketing to this day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I got my first few jobs quite quickly which meant I needed employees fast. What I did was go to the gym I worked out at and walked up to two random guys, started chatting, and basically convinced them to go a move with me the next day. So I invited them over to my house and showed them how to wrap up the furniture in my living room and what my expectations were. I’m honestly surprised it went smoothly looking back.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I remember the very first move I did was for $950 and I was doing the math on if I did that 5 times a week that’s $4,750! Or Woah! What if I could do that 40 times a month! $38,000!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there, I used every dollar of incoming capital and deposits from upcoming booked moves to fund expenses. I went 28 months before receiving my first paycheck from this business due to re-investing every dollar back into the company. Luckily, I still owned PoolsMax which I used to pay my bills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We grew fairly rapidly in the first few months as I was trying to do absolutely everything I could on jobs to provide the best possible customer services. Word of mouth referrals started rolling in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before starting I was concerned I would have a hard time managing people who were all older than me. I was pleasantly surprised that If I worked hard and treated my workers with respect they had no issues with working for me and many actually wanted to “the young guy” to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I learned to do everything I can to make the right hire the first time. In the beginning I would try out any guy that seems decent. Now we may hire 1 out of 20 movers that come in to interview and we spend 5x the time training them. The right people make life and business much easier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Since launch, what has worked to attract and retain customers?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marketing areas that have worked with their respective pros and cons:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Google ads&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very targeted: It is possible to target very narrow demographics or even target groups by recent life events&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Majority of people search Google first&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Without a very large budget it is hard to make a big ripple. It seems more and more that the only way to have a huge effect is by having a huge budget.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yelp ads&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yelp has high consumer trust. Many people take Yelp’s recommendations as if it were a friend telling them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can rank #1 in a city for a service you yield massive results. There doesn’t seem to be much of a long tail in that the top three or so results get all the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Predatory sales tactics: They are a bit harassing with their phone calls and claim it helps the page&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real reviews getting taken down. They have a recommendation system in which certain reviews become unviewable this tends to happen to at least 50% of reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contracts for ads. They don’t allow month to month deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;Groupon&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy way to increase traffic if you are a new business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will advertise for you: They run Google ads advertising your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They require a very low, somewhat un-sustainable price.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h4&gt;In-Person Marketing (my favorite)&lt;/h4&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I like to constantly think about what my competition isn’t doing. We live in a time where everyone’s marketing efforts consists of online ads and not very much in person marketing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit awkward at times and it takes a lot of effort but this is by far the best form of marketing I have utilized. I recently documented the process of me making a connections with 500 businesses that could potentially refer my business to their clients and it yielded me a reoccurring $30,000-$40,000 in additional sales per month. The entire process and results can be seen here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYwiK6uBsZo\"&gt;YT video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extremely effective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cheap to do&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A lot of effort&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;How are you doing today and what does the future look like?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At Skinny Wimp we are currently working on quality above all else. I have recently hired a quality control manager at my main Phoenix, Arizona location whose sole job is to ensure our movers are the best possible version of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have build a weight rating system of 7 key metrics in which we grade our movers:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professionalism&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Timeliness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Protection of furniture&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In-home protection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friendliness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Safe driving&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a miscellaneous metric&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are looking to expand to storage services within the year in order to better serve our customers with a one-stop shop. This is very capital intensive, though, so it is going to take a good bit of effort and planning. The ultimate goal is to build the storage business larger than the moving business. The margins in the storage industry are very high compared to the moving industry (around 30% for my moving companies and we are on the high end) compared to up to 60% for storage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personally, I have a YouTube channel in which I display my favorite things in life learning/self-improvement. I document a mix of business challenges/struggles (things like this &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bPv-Wd20SFQ%26t=224s\"&gt;short case study on my experiment working 10 hours a day for 50 days straight&lt;/a&gt;) and personal goal setting as well. As the channel grows we are working on doing bigger and bigger projects like my upcoming documentary on my experience training for and running an ultra-marathon which will be released mid April. My goal of this channel is to lead by example to influence people to get out of their comfort zone, try new things, and build the best versions of themselves.. Not because it’s easy but because it’s hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Through starting the business, have you learned anything particularly helpful or advantageous?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My biggest business mistake to date was expanding to new states hundreds of miles away too soon. We should have waited a little longer, built out systems and built up capital a little longer before taking on such an audacious project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The farther away new locations are from the primary the harder it is to manage new locations. It ended up alright in the end but at the cost of extreme pressures and stress, it may have been a lesson I needed to learn because I tend to jump into things quickly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The best decision I made was not paying myself for the first few years. By building up the bank account instead of buying myself fancy things I was able to much more easily get through some of the hard times that inevitably come up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What have been the most influential books, podcasts, or other resources?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am a huge consumer of educational material.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite books of the last year are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Never Split the Difference which helped me massively in conflict negotiation and interpersonal conflicts&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Poor Charlie’s Almanac because it inspired me further to become a lifelong learner and the benefits of such a thing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Idea Man which ada he impact on me. I never realized the masie effect Paul Allen had on the world and it made me realize that is exactly what I ultimately want in life, to positively affect the greatest number of people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My favorite podcasts are How I Built This and The Sweaty Startup for business stories and lessons and Mindscape for all things science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Advice for other entrepreneurs who want to get started or are just starting out?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two of the top questions I get asked from young entrepreneurs are “When should I start?” and “How should I market?” They are very good questions and here is how I would address them:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When should I start?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just Go&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That perfect time you’ve been waiting for to start isn’t going to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your product/service will never be perfect before launch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably ever have the ideal amount of time, energy, or money it takes to launch perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things You Should Focus on Instead of When to Start&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can I get my product/service out there as quickly and efficiently as possible?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think in terms of what your Minimum Viable Product is. This is a concept developed by Eric Ries in his book The Lean Startup and a technique that has ben used to start some of today’s biggest businesses such as Twitter, dropbox, Groupon, and zappos. This concept in its simplest form is figuring out what the bare minimum is to launch your business and provide value, then do it. Launching your MVP prevents you from wasting resources on things that may end up having no value. The last thing you want to do is spend years planning and creating this grand plan only to find after launch that customers only care about one portion of your idea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s easier to learn what the market likes than it is to guess what the market wants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t just apply to tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s say you want to start a landscaping business. Yes it would be wonderful to buy a brand new truck $50,000 and mower $1,500 and tools $1000 and website $1000 and get an office space for $2000 down. But let’s break down what you truly need to start. An old vehicle, push mower, and business cards will do just fine, $4000.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now some of you might be thinking I don’t even have $4k so I can’t start a business. So let’s go one step further and limit our service line down to things done by hand. Shoveling, raking, and pulling weeds. What does it really take to start that business? Used hand tools for $70 and business cards for $30. You don’t even need a vehicle, you can walk yard to yard if you have to. So we just took our faraway goal of saving $55,500 to start the perfect landscaping business to a $100 business that we can start today and begin making money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The true beauty of this is now that it costs you less than $100 to start a business you can try it and if it doesn’t work or you don’t like it move on to the next $100 start-up&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You may be thinking “How am I ever going to grow or make real money if I’m raking a yard myself for $20 a house when I could never do more than 50 houses?” and that brings us to next point of doing things that don’t scale. This is a famous philosophy by Paul Graham of Y Combinator. It basically means it is &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; and actually a good strategy to do things now that won’t work when your business grows to the next stage. That is because without it your business may never even grow to the next stage!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Worry about how you’ll handle 60 accounts when you’re already at 50 accounts and earning the income of 50 accounts, not when you’re at 0&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don’t Assume You Have a Lot of Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever age you are, seize every day. Every single day that you’re not out progressing yourself or your business is a day lost.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s say on days you work you make $100 and you could have worked today but you took the day off. You need to think in terms that you didn’t just miss out on $100 but you actually lost $100. And we can take that one step further. Let&amp;#39;s say every $100 you invest back in your business returns you 10% a year so that’s:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$110 after year 1. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$161.05 after year 5. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$259.37 after year 10.        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;$672.72 after year 20. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It gets much crazier after that. The point is today ALWAYS matters and the sooner you start the sooner you can use this compounding to your advantage not your disadvantage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Should I Market?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is obviously something that varies quite a bit from industry to industry but when approaching marketing I like to go back to the thought process of “What can I do today?” and “How many things can I try for the lowest cost possible?”. If you have a low amount of cash to spend your greatest asset will be willpower and getting face to face with as many people related to your business as possible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knock Twice Marketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is a type of marketing I find extremely effective. It is based on the premise you should never try to sell to someone just once.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marketing when you first start a business is hard. &lt;em&gt;Think persistence&lt;/em&gt;. People admire persistence especially from young people because it’s a trait they hope other’s see in them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most&lt;/strong&gt;  people will never ask for your business because of the fear of rejection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some&lt;/strong&gt;  people will knock once or ask for your business once. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Almost&lt;/strong&gt;  no one will keep knocking after the first no. Now I’m not saying to be an overly aggressive salesman I’m talking about just a friendly “Hey I’m still here and I would love to have your business”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about what it takes you to use a business. Are you going to use the company that you saw one advertisement for or the one you see and are reminded of every week?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The power of persistence has helped me more times than I can count. And a perfect example is for one of my businesses I do cold pitches to businesses or people who can refer my business to their clients. I walked into a store and gave my pitch to the assistant manager who said “Sounds great, my manager deals with vendors, I’ll make sure she contacts you.” so I leave and three days later no response from the manager.. I type up a friendly email about how I talked to her assistant manager and what I am hoping to get accomplished . A week later, no response. I go back to the same store and the manager is there, I mention who I am, that I talked to her assistant and that I was hoping to become a vendor. That’s when she remembered my email and said “Oh yeah, I was going to respond to your email but we’ve been swamped so I haven’t been able to yet, I apologize for that! I saw you have great reviews and think you’d be a good fit” she then pulled out the form to become a vendor and I filled it out on the spot. I could have quit any step of that process and wouldn’t currently be receiving income from that contract.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Start now, put yourself out there and ask for their business. Sure be conscious that you may get rejected but don’t be afraid to ask more than once. It won’t work every time but it will work 100% more than not trying at all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Are you looking to hire for certain positions right now?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don’t have a specific position I currently need filled but I would never turn down the opportunity to speak with a passionate, skilled person who may be able to help out my company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, as I mentioned I am looking to get into the storage business, so I am the process of looking for investors for this next step.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are always looking for new movers/crew leads to join us and rise up the ranks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Where can we go to learn more?&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Personal&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher\"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/c/maxmaher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/\"&gt;https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_maher/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"mailto:becauseitshard@gmail.com\"&gt;becauseitshard@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Business&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.skinnywimpmoving.com\"&gt;www.skinnywimpmoving.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.poolsmax.com\"&gt;www.poolsmax.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or comments, drop a comment below!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Liked this text interview?

Revenue bonds to build or improve power facilities must be approved by the voters.\n\n**Proposition**:  If you vote \"yes,\" you want to authorize the PUC to issue revenue bonds to build or improve the City’s clean power facilities, with approval by two\\-thirds of the Board of Supervisors, and to prohibit the PUC from financing construction of power plants that generate electricity from fossil fuels or nuclear power.\n\n**Controller Statement**: Should the proposed charter amendment be approved by the voters, in my opinion, it would have no direct impact on the cost of government.\n\n[**Prop B: Prohibiting Appointed Commissioners from Running for Office**](https://voterguide.sfelections.org/en/prohibiting-appointed-commissioners-running-office)\n\n**The Way It Is Now:** commissioners appointed by the Mayor and Board of Supervisors can run for office while serving\n\n**The Proposal:** appointed officials would have to forfeit their seat to run for office\n\n[**Prop C: Additional Tax on Commercial Rents Mostly to Fund Child Care and Education**](https://voterguide.sfelections.org/en/additional-tax-commercial-rents-mostly-fund-child-care-and-education)\n\n[**Prop D: Additional Tax on Commercial Rents Mostly to Fund Housing and Homelessness Services**](https://voterguide.sfelections.org/en/additional-tax-commercial-rents-mostly-fund-housing-and-homelessness-services)\n\n***Propositions C and D concern the same tax. If both measures are adopted by the voters, the one with the most votes will be enacted.***\n\n**The Way It Is Now:** The city taxes revenues from leasing commercial property at .285\\-.3&amp;#37; exempting most business making less than $1million in gross rev.\n\n**Prop C Proposal**: If you vote \"yes,\" you want to impose a new gross receipts tax of 1&amp;#37; on revenues a business receives from the lease of warehouse space in the City, and 3.5&amp;#37; on revenues a business receives from the lease of some commercial spaces in the City to fund quality early care and education for young children, and for other general purposes.\n\n**Prop D Proposal:** If you vote \"yes,\" you want to impose a new gross receipts tax of 1.7&amp;#37; on revenues a business receives from the lease of some commer­cial spaces in San Francisco to fund homeless ser­vices, extremely low\\- to middle\\-income housing and other general purposes.\n\n**Controller Statement:**\n\no C – should generate additional net annual revenue to the City of approximately $146 million. $124.1 million for child care and early education, $21.9 million for any public purpose \n\no D \\- should generate additional net annual revenue to the City of approximately $70 million to be directed towards affordable housing and homeless programs.

The yes campaign claims these flavors are marketed towards kids to develop dependency on tobacco products.\n\n**Main Argument for “No”**: Compares the ban to prohibition of alcohol and weed. California already bans cigarette sales to people under 21 so this ban would only prevent adults from making their own choices. The ban would prevent the sales of more than what they say the “Yes” campaign implies such as hookah tobacco. \n\n[**Prop F: City\\-Funded Legal Representation for Residential Tenants in Eviction Lawsuits**](https://voterguide.sfelections.org/en/city-funded-legal-representation-residential-tenants-eviction-lawsuits)\n\n**The Way It Is Now**: The city funds nonprofit organizations that provide free legal representation to some San Francisco resi­dential tenants who face eviction at approximately $6.4 million/ year. \n\n**The Proposal:** If you vote \"yes,\" you want to require the City to establish, fund and run a program to provide legal representation for all residential ten­ants in San Francisco facing eviction.\n\n**Controller Statement:** The cost would be dependent on the budget set by future Mayors and Boards of Supervisors. If fully funded this would increase the program’s costs by an estimated $4.2 to $5.6 million/ year\n\n[**Prop G: Parcel Tax for San Francisco Unified School District**](https://voterguide.sfelections.org/en/parcel-tax-san-francisco-unified-school-district)\n\n**The Way It Is Now**: SF schools educates approximately 57,000 students and employs about 6,200 teachers.\n\n**The Proposal:** If you vote \"yes,\" you want to authorize the City to collect an annual tax of $298 per parcel \\(unit of property\\) for investment in education \\(higher teacher wages, technology for schools, funding for charter schools, and more\\), subject to certain exemptions including those for senior citizens.\n\n**Controller Statement:** should generate new tax reve­nues of approximately $50 million annually.\n\n[**Prop H: Policy for the Use of Tasers by San Francisco Police Officers**](https://voterguide.sfelections.org/en/policy-use-tasers-san-francisco-police-officers)\n\n**The Way It Is Now**: The police department does not currently use tasers but has been authorized to start using them in Dec. 2018.\n\n**The Proposal:** If you vote \"yes,\" you want to set a policy for the use of tasers and authorize the purchase of tasers for each police officer by the Police Department, subject to specific conditions\n\n**Controller Statement:** The cost would be dependent on decisions by the Mayor and Board of Supervisors during the budget process. The program would cost an estimated $4.5 million for the purchase of tasers and for initial training. There would also be a new ongoing annual cost of approximately $200,000 for training,\n\n[**Prop I: Relocation of Professional Sports Teams**](https://voterguide.sfelections.org/en/relocation-professional-sports-teams)\n\n**The Way It Is Now**: The city’s sports teams include the Giants and 49ers football team plays its home games in Santa Clara. The Warriors play in Oakland, but will start playing in the Mission in SF when the Chase Center is completed. This arena is expected to be open for the Warriors’ 2019\\-20 season.\n\n**The Proposal**: If you vote \"yes,\" you want to make it City policy not to encourage professional sports teams from other cities to move to San Francisco and to take a stand against any sports team ownership group attempting to avoid payment of an outstanding public debt.\n\n**Controller Statement:** Should the proposed declaration of policy be approved by the voters, in my opinion, it would not affect the cost of government.",

The yes campaign claims these flavors are marketed towards kids to develop dependency on tobacco products.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main Argument for “No”&lt;/strong&gt;: Compares the ban to prohibition of alcohol and weed. California already bans cigarette sales to people under 21 so this ban would only prevent adults from making their own choices. The ban would prevent the sales of more than what they say the “Yes” campaign implies such as hookah tobacco. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://voterguide.sfelections.org/en/city-funded-legal-representation-residential-tenants-eviction-lawsuits\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prop F: City-Funded Legal Representation for Residential Tenants in Eviction Lawsuits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Way It Is Now&lt;/strong&gt;: The city funds nonprofit organizations that provide free legal representation to some San Francisco resi­dential tenants who face eviction at approximately $6.4 million/ year. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Proposal:&lt;/strong&gt; If you vote &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; you want to require the City to establish, fund and run a program to provide legal representation for all residential ten­ants in San Francisco facing eviction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controller Statement:&lt;/strong&gt; The cost would be dependent on the budget set by future Mayors and Boards of Supervisors.

The program would cost an estimated $4.5 million for the purchase of tasers and for initial training. There would also be a new ongoing annual cost of approximately $200,000 for training,&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://voterguide.sfelections.org/en/relocation-professional-sports-teams\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prop I: Relocation of Professional Sports Teams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Way It Is Now&lt;/strong&gt;: The city’s sports teams include the Giants and 49ers football team plays its home games in Santa Clara.

This arena is expected to be open for the Warriors’ 2019-20 season.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Proposal&lt;/strong&gt;: If you vote &amp;quot;yes,&amp;quot; you want to make it City policy not to encourage professional sports teams from other cities to move to San Francisco and to take a stand against any sports team ownership group attempting to avoid payment of an outstanding public debt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controller Statement:&lt;/strong&gt; Should the proposed declaration of policy be approved by the voters, in my opinion, it would not affect the cost of government.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Two years ago, she moved back to Guatemala for the summer and realized how much struggle indigenous communities in the country faced. Artisans held so much natural talent in design and weaving but lacked the resources to market their products. In the Fall of 2017, through the FSU InNOLEvation Challenge, Hannah began Woven Futures, a fashion company dedicated to empowering indigenous artisan women around the globe while creating meaningful connections within the US. Woven Futures bridges the resource gap for artisans and puts transparency and authenticity at its forefront. Through the online platform (&lt;a href=\"http://www.wovenfutures.com\"&gt;www.wovenfutures.com&lt;/a&gt;) you can read about artisans, how they make your products, and the social impact that you create when you purchase a product.” 6pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midtown Reader: March Book of the Month Club - Kindred by Octavia Butler. &lt;strong&gt;Hank says, this is a readlly great book.&lt;/strong&gt; 6:30pm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cap City Video Lounge: The Living Deads, R.P.

          "selftext": "So after doing some brief research, reading articles, and joining discussion on the [thread from this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/Detroit/comments/6ymp6m/amazon_to_build_second_hq_in_north_america_seeks/), I think this might be a good option for an RFP to Amazon. Let me know what you think.\n\nTLDR: Propose the Fisher Body Plant and surrounding 17 blocks, and bypass voters to build a commuter rail from Pontiac to Ann Arbor via New Center.\n\n**Location**\n\nCredit for this goes to /u/whathandurollupwit from the original thread, and I agree. New Center / Milwaukee Junction/ TechTown seems to be our best bet - [specifically the area bounded by 94, 75, Woodward, and the rail line](https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3678253,-83.0660678,1008m/data=!3m1!1e3). The Fisher Body plant could be converted to some trendy hip office space (the RFP also said \"Communities that think big and creatively when considering locations and real estate options\"), and there's plenty of vacant lots and empty storefronts/warehouses to demo and build anew on. This is a 17 block area, has direct freeway access to 2 major arteries (to Chicago, Canada, Ohio etc), has QLine transit access (I'll get to that in a minute), is as close to the heart of a downtown as you can get in most cities with this amount of land, is down the street from a university, and is steps away from Amtrak access and freight lines if needed..\n\nAside: This would also give the forced \"TechTown\" name some true meaning..\n\n**Transit**\n\n[Amazon's RFP specifically states that](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Anything/test/images/usa/RFP_3._V516043504_.pdf) transit access is a big factor in this decision. The QLine is a great start, but not enough, and the general consensus in the earlier thread was that transit would be our downfall. I think if Detroit/Michigan pitches a site like this, we need to commit to building some 21st century infrastructure to match their request. No region-wide vote and years of construction, just MDOT and federal grants with immediate work. We could show Amazon these plans and promise a completion date of 2025, for instance. I think the best we could do would be extending the QLine to Pontiac and DTW via Dearborn. Here's potential routes:\n\n[Woodward - Pontiac](https://i.imgur.com/pKLWteY.png)\n\n[Michigan - DTW](https://i.imgur.com/4BKx9R7.png)\n\nIf we use [Phoenix's Valley Rail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_Metro_Rail) as a modern example - their project cost $1.4B for 20 miles of route in 2008. Extending the QLine from Grand to Pontiac is exactly 22 miles, and from Campus Martius to McNamara terminal is 21.2 on the route I drew up. Napkin math, that gives us maybe $3.5B to come up with for 44 miles of light rail in the next decade.\n\nI have no idea how this would happen; if MDOT could come up with the funding, if Amazon would pitch in at all in exchange for tax breaks, if we'd put it to a vote again, I just know that those are the rough numbers for an initial system.\n\nIf we want to save some money, would could use existing rail line ROW to build a commuter line of the same route, with stops in Pontiac, Troy, Royal Oak, the Fairgrounds, New Center of course, Dearborn, and DTW/Wayne (also extend to Ann Arbor/Ypsi). Even if we did this cheaper route, I think having some kind of rail to the airport is crucial, so we should either build new track to the terminals or build some kind of People Mover connecting the terminals to a transit hub on Michigan/Middlebelt by the main tracks.\n\nAgain, I don't know how this would go down at all, I'm just giving options since buses aren't going to cut it for 50,000 workers.\n\nIf we built transit on these corridors, I'm sure Dearborn, Royal Oak, Pontiac etc. would **LOVE** the growth in residential and commercial development that would come with 50,000+ new residents possibly living along the route.\n\n**Funding**\n\nI don't know the first thing about taxes or economics, but IMO we should offer this to Amazon tax-free for X amount of years. The population growth and hundreds of firms and businesses that would sprout up from this kind of investment would MORE than make up for the missed corporate revenue - not to mention the economic benefits of the hypothetical new transit. Building a campus at no cost besides construction would make an attractive offer. Maybe I'm stupid and dead wrong though, I don't know.\n\n**Some other Advantages**\n\n- DTW is a major hub and only 30 minutes from downtown. This was a requirement that was listed in the RFP.\n\n- Good highway access and minimal traffic across the region.\n\n- We're smack-dab in between Chicago and Toronto, and other major cities like Cleveland, Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Columbus, Cincinnati, Nashville, Minneapolis etc. are a few hours to half-day's drive away. Amtrak has a highspeed connection to Chicago now too, and again, would be steps away from this office.\n\n- Lots of engineering talent in the area and a growing tech scene.\n\n- Great universities in the state/region.\n\n- Attractive place to live overall. Executives could have mansions on Lake Michigan and employees could have corporate retreats to the UP. Believe it or not, huge companies consider the overall region's beauty sometimes in these decisions. No one wants to live in an uninteresting area. \n\n- Low cost of living and cheap land.\n\n- Amazon could take credit for helping with \"Detroit's Comeback\", which is great PR and companies already in the region are doing this.\n\n- Amazon has considered breaking into the self-driving car game. This might help.\n\nAnything I missed?\n\nAmazon gave some very specific requirements here that I think might rule out a lot of potential competition. For example, they can't be more than 1-2 miles from a major arterial freeway. Any city that has development already built up along their freeways is possibly out.\n\nI think if we can address the lack of transit, which again is a requirement, and offer a financial incentive they can't decline, we might make ourselves a contender with this.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nHere's some check marks this would give off the RFP.\n\n- \"Connectivity: Ensuring optimal fiber connectivity is paramount at our HQ2 location. Please\ndemonstrate the fiber connectivity on all submitted sites. Also, demonstrate multiple cellular phone\ncoverage maps to ensure optimal service.\"\n\nCheck. Fiber already runs down Woodward.\n\n- \"Existing buildings of at least 500,000+ sq. ft., meeting the core requirements described\nabove and that are expandable or have additional options for development nearby.\"\n\nCheck. The Fisher Plant would provide that and the surrounding blocks are mostly blight or easy-to-buy and demo properties. The only thing I'd oppose removing is the Piquette Plant for historical reasons.\n\n- \"Other infill, existing buildings, including opportunities for renovation/redevelopment and\ngreenfield sites, meeting the proximity and logistics requirements of the Project. This can\nalso be a combination of the above\"\n\nCheck.\n\n- \"– Personnel travel and logistics needs, both from population centers to the Project site, as\nwell as between company facilities, are critically important. As such, travel time to a major highway\ncorridor and arterial roadway capacity potential are key factors. The highway corridors must provide\ndirect access to significant population centers with eligible employment pools. Travel time to an\ninternational airport with daily direct flights to Seattle, New York, San Francisco/Bay Area, and\nWashington, D.C. is also an important consideration.\"\n\nCheck, and I'm pretty sure we offer direct flights to all of those as well, but I'll double check later.\n\n- \"The Project requires an expeditious timetable for the location decision and\nthe commencement of construction. Given this, sites with the requisite access, utility\ninfrastructure, and zoning are critical. Please outline the permitting process and estimated\ntimetable to initiate Phase I of our operations.\"\n\nCheck. Finish cleaning up the Fisher Plant and update the roads/utilities and we're set.\n\n- \"The Project requires a compatible cultural and community environment for\nits long-term success. This includes the presence and support of a diverse population, excellent\ninstitutions of higher education, local government structure and elected officials eager and willing to\nwork with the company, among other attributes. A stable and consistent business climate is\nimportant to Amazon. Please demonstrate characteristics of this in your response. We encourage\ntestimonials from other large companies.\"\n\nCheck. The only problem might be a \"stable\" business climate since auto is very cyclical.",

Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Propose the Fisher Body Plant and surrounding 17 blocks, and bypass voters to build a commuter rail from Pontiac to Ann Arbor via New Center.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Credit for this goes to &lt;a href=\"/u/whathandurollupwit\"&gt;/u/whathandurollupwit&lt;/a&gt; from the original thread, and I agree. New Center / Milwaukee Junction/ TechTown seems to be our best bet - &lt;a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3678253,-83.0660678,1008m/data=!3m1!1e3\"&gt;specifically the area bounded by 94, 75, Woodward, and the rail line&lt;/a&gt;. The Fisher Body plant could be converted to some trendy hip office space (the RFP also said &amp;quot;Communities that think big and creatively when considering locations and real estate options&amp;quot;), and there&amp;#39;s plenty of vacant lots and empty storefronts/warehouses to demo and build anew on. This is a 17 block area, has direct freeway access to 2 major arteries (to Chicago, Canada, Ohio etc), has QLine transit access (I&amp;#39;ll get to that in a minute), is as close to the heart of a downtown as you can get in most cities with this amount of land, is down the street from a university, and is steps away from Amtrak access and freight lines if needed..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aside: This would also give the forced &amp;quot;TechTown&amp;quot; name some true meaning..&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/Anything/test/images/usa/RFP_3._V516043504_.pdf\"&gt;Amazon&amp;#39;s RFP specifically states that&lt;/a&gt; transit access is a big factor in this decision. The QLine is a great start, but not enough, and the general consensus in the earlier thread was that transit would be our downfall. I think if Detroit/Michigan pitches a site like this, we need to commit to building some 21st century infrastructure to match their request. No region-wide vote and years of construction, just MDOT and federal grants with immediate work. We could show Amazon these plans and promise a completion date of 2025, for instance. I think the best we could do would be extending the QLine to Pontiac and DTW via Dearborn. Here&amp;#39;s potential routes:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/pKLWteY.png\"&gt;Woodward - Pontiac&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/4BKx9R7.png\"&gt;Michigan - DTW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If we use &lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_Metro_Rail\"&gt;Phoenix&amp;#39;s Valley Rail&lt;/a&gt; as a modern example - their project cost $1.4B for 20 miles of route in 2008.

          "selftext": "This is a lengthy post, but maybe you need an excuse to distract you from writing. I hope you find it encouraging with your current project, or to at least get some discussion about this topic going. Thanks for reading! (tl;dr at the end)\n\n**Who am I?**\nThirteen years ago, on the day of my wedding reception, I decided I was going to make a movie. I had just discovered Robert Rodriguez’s Rebel Without a Crew and was reading it in between events. His story about the making of El Mariachi infused me with a sense of hope that I could tackle it all and make my own movie. I didn’t know why, but this idea wouldn’t leave me. It impressed itself so deeply in my psyche that I knew some sort of involvement in the film industry would be my life’s pursuit.\n\nI guess the young optimist in me loved the challenge of the unknown. My friends all had plans for life: accountants, business degrees, fabricators at the steel plant. All labels and careers which put the minds of concerned parents, spouses, and in-laws at ease. I knew if I applied myself I could earn a bachelor’s degree and become an engineer, surveyor, teacher, or any one of those sure labels. But that all seemed so boring to me. I thought, I’m going to become a filmmaker, that’s the uncharted territory. I knew this meant I could attend four years of film school and end up waiting tables. A career in the arts was not a sure path, for some sick reason this appealed to me.\n\n**I started writing**\na script about a group of men, all tradesmen, who get the shaft from their boss when he attempts to fuse them to their tools and erase their memories, so they become half human, half machines that take on any job with ease. I was an electrician. My dad was an electrician. My grandpa was an electrician. My great-grandpa was an electrician. So I had access to all the goodies to create costumes, power tools, big crane shots, etc. I wanted to make a breakout film that would save me from my electrical destiny.\n\nI created costumes, cast the movie, and arranged sets. My ever-optimistic mother even bought me the coveted Canon XL1s to shoot my masterpiece. We completed one day of shooting, then a half day, then our lead actor couldn’t come the next week because he was deer hunting. So “Handymen” died a victim of circumstance. I decided organizing all these people, building costumes, and shooting with no crew was a huge pain, so I’d stick to writing; just me, the blank page, and my unfettered imagination.\n\n**I got a job maintaining a rest area**\nand it was perfect. The summers were busy, but during winter I had long uninterrupted hours to spend on my next project — an adaptation of Lee Nelson’s book about Mormon folklore hero Porter Rockwell. I set up a small work space in the maintenance closet of the rest area and began working to the soundtrack of industrial exhaust fans and flushing toilets.\n\nI had no idea what I was doing. I just wanted to write and learn. I didn’t have permission from Lee Nelson. I figured that problem would work itself out over time. I spent countless hours day after day that winter kind of getting paid to write. During this time I also read Mike Medavoy’s *You’re Only as Good as Your Next One* to learn about the producing side of the movie business. His most fascinating revelation to me was his speculation if he’d produced all the movies he turned down, and turned down all the movies he’d produced, he might have had the same amount of success. I thought that was crazy! So many stories up for consideration and then buried. But it appealed to me, and made sense. I wanted to be part of that crazy industry, in an at-least-I’m-not-a-dentist sort of way.\n\n**So I got this wild idea**\nafter finishing Mike’s book to contact him and tell him I had an amazing screenplay called “Handymen”. I wrote a letter and told him I enjoyed his book, then made a small pitch at the end for my hot script.\n\nI shit my pants when I received a phone call from Phoenix Pictures (on what must have been the same day he got my letter) requesting a copy of my script. I remember exactly where I was, on the cement steps of the front of the rest area. I hung up the phone and screamed. I ran all over jumping and shouting, “What luck! This is it! I followed my dream! This is my big break!” (luckily nobody was around) Then the reality hit that I had to send this script, the first script I’d ever written, to one of the most prolific producers in Hollywood.\n\nI put the Rockwell adaptation aside and did a quick polish before sending off my million dollar, bidding-war-inducing masterpiece. I could feel success coming my way; a Hollywood prodigy arises!\n\nI waited and waited. I made a follow up call, then another, then about a month later I received information that they had to pass, but wished me the best of luck. After I picked my ego up off the floor, I realized it’s not hard to get a script read in Hollywood; it’s hard to write a good script. Luckily, I had my hot adaptation in the works for my next opportunity.\n\n**My next pants-shitting event**\nhappened when I saw Lee Nelson himself was coming to do a book signing at the local library. What luck! How could it be that I chose to do this adaptation months ago, and now I would get to present a finished copy to the original author! He would love it and use his connections to make my beautiful adaptation happen! What a beautiful start to a screenwriting career! I finished the draft and headed into the library a few weeks later.\n\nI met Lee Nelson, listened to his stories of killing buffalo from horseback, waited for him to sign autographs, then helped him gather up his boxes of books and take them to his truck. I figured I had brown-nosed enough to present my script. He listened to me, was excited? And then took a copy and told me he would be in touch.\n\nMore waiting for me, more ideas brewing, then news from Lee that my script was too heavy on exposition, too wordy, and needed better flow. “I based it on your book, asshole!” is what I wanted to say, but instead took his words into consideration and began revising. I think I sent him a second or third draft, but nothing came of it.\n\n**Life and kids happened**\nso I stopped writing for awhile. I flipped a house, worked various construction jobs, always had my electrical background to pay the bills, and then one day I came across the hollow earth theory. Holy Shit! I have to make that into a screenplay! It’s like Indiana Jones for modern times! (I’m afraid my interest in conspiracy theories as seeds for more believable stories is often misconstrued as belief in conspiracies themselves, but I digress.)\n\nThe hollow earth theory blew my mind. YouTube was a thing now, so I could watch plenty of “proof” of hollow earth’s existence. I found the short story “The Smoky God” about a Norwegian sailor and his son mistakenly finding the opening to hollow earth and thought, “That’s it! My new adaptation!” So I began work on the public domain narrative (screw you, Lee Nelson!) while paralleling it with a modern day story about a college kid making the same journey inside the earth to find his lost parents.\n\nThis script would be my masterpiece, two movies in one, so many time changes, flashbacks, fades from the 1800’s to modern day, it would be so ahead of its time as a script, as a story, as an instant classic. I wrote, and read, and wrote, and read, and a few months later I had my first draft, the only draft I would need to break down the doors of Hollywood and establish myself as the next William Goldman.\n\nI decided to contact my old buddy Mike again, because although he wasn’t interested in my first script, he at least told me why. Because of his feedback I learned. I became a better writer. I wasn’t left in the dark. It also helped that at this time Avatar was shattering box office records all over the place and I had an easy pitch as “Avatar set inside planet earth.”\n\nI sent it. I waited. Mike responded that the multiple storylines, time changes, flashbacks, and time jumps confused the narrative, just too much of my own awesomeness (my words, not his). So I revised and sent it again. Mike responded that it was improved, but he respectfully had to pass.\n\n**So there I was again, back where I started**\nmore beat down on one side, more built up on the other, more educated, less enthused, talking to Hollywood bigwigs, still as far away from Hollywood as possible. I decided to attend college and get a theater degree with a creative writing minor. It had been a long time since setting foot in an educational institution. I felt like I was conforming and giving in. I wanted to be that breakout writer who bucked the system, but at least I wasn’t working construction anymore.\n\nI soaked college in, Aristotle’s Elements? Would have been nice to know a few years ago. But by the end of my first year I started to feel the unscratched itch again, that goal implanted in my central being telling me it’s time to sell a screenplay, you won’t be happy until you do.\n\nI picked up another screenwriting book to read, *Essentials of Screenwriting* by Richard Walter. I figured now that I was on my way to a bachelor’s degree, maybe applying to UCLA’s screenwriting program wasn’t so unreachable. This Walter guy worked at UCLA; I figured I’d read his book.\n\nI read the book, realized how bad my previous scripts sucked (there are others I haven’t mentioned), and decided my last script, the hollow earth one, was the only thing worth saving.\n\n**I started another draft**\nand by the time I finished Walter’s book, I knew I needed to revise again. So I did. I used my print credits to produce what was my first actual script that could be shown to someone. I realized how naive and foolish I’d been with those early scripts, those first drafts. We’ll call them building blocks.\n\nHere I had a script, and flipping through the pages it looked like a script: a lot of white, properly formatted, a single narrative, and no flashbacks. At the end of Walter’s book was an “if you dare” invitation to send in a script for his consideration. What did I have to lose? All he can say is no, and I’d already been told no by the best in the business.\n\nI sent in the script. The third (or fourth?) shitting of my pants happened when I received a phone call from area code 301. Anybody outside Los Angeles knows that’s a heart stopper. I answered my cell and it was Richard Fucking Walter! Suddenly this person who wrote an actual book, that I could hold in my hand, that I bought from Amazon, was real. The world became a little smaller that day. I sat at my desk and maintained composure. He told me my script was good, it needed work, but it was an engaging story, and original. He said he sees a lot of scripts and doesn’t say that about many of them. I listened much and talked little. At the end of the conversation he made a proposal to work with me on the script and then help me with a referral. What luck! This is it! I thought all those previous times were it, but THIS IS IT!\n\nI figured this was probably a once in a lifetime opportunity and if I said no I would forever wonder what if? I couldn’t live with that, so I said yes. After hanging up I jumped around, and screamed, and cheered, then I called my wife and told her I had to sell my guns, her piano, anything unnecessary, and I also needed our savings to pay for this educational experience.\n\n**What followed can only be described as a crash course in humility**\nI sent in my latest draft, waited a few weeks, and received a lengthy email with encouragement, positive feedback, and then a page-by-page analysis. This was invaluable. All the suggestions, ideas, rules, and guidelines I’d seen and read in so many screenwriting books suddenly made sense. I felt like I missed the point on all of them now seeing the “rules” applied directly to my writing. It was frustrating at times, but what did I know? I didn’t want to let my pride get in the way of learning.\n\nThis exchange consumed almost a year of sending drafts, waiting for feedback, receiving feedback, another two months on a draft, etc. Through all of it I learned patience, and that the big sale, the mad bidding wars, the idea of a big payout was no longer my goal. Ha, ha, bullshit —  I tricked you. Of course I wanted to sell that thing and plate my teeth in gold, but really I wanted to become a better writer. I wanted the ability to notice these problems in my first draft, not my eighth.\n\n**The time finally came**\nthat Richard felt I was ready for a referral. Now get this: this was an esteemed educator recommending me to an agent or manager. I didn’t know of a better referral other than saving a movie star’s dog from death on the freeway and telling them you need an agent. This had to be it! Of course Richard made no guarantees of a sale, and I understood. So away we went. I was put in contact with a manager and my professionally polished, millionth-draft script floated out on the town.\n\nI waited and waited. I read Deadline. I expected to see a bidding war announced anytime soon. Just kidding, by this time I expected at most for my script to get me a writing assignment on another script, a revision or something.\n\nWord came back to me. The feedback given was, “Your script is like black coffee. It needs to be more caramel macchiato.”\n\nWhat the mother fuck? Is that even feedback? I wanted to scream, “Your feedback is like shit! It needs to be more not like shit! And I happen to like black coffee! It’s solid. It does its job. People only add shit to coffee because they can’t handle the real deal, PANSIES! You want caramel macchiato? Go down to Starfucks and tell those hipster bitches you need a caramel macchi-fucking-enema!”\n\nBut instead I said, “Thank you, I’ll work on another draft.”\n\n**So I spiced it up**\nand to be honest I can’t remember what happened after that. I think it went out again, or not. I think I was told to change some stuff on page thirty. Really? That’s going to seal the deal? I was now bored of working on *Within* and wanted to start on a new project, something exciting.\n\nNothing feels better than leaving an overworked script behind for something shiny and fun. A new script idea is like a new girlfriend, you only see the fun parts until you’ve spent too much time with it. But I had a new idea, something goofy, something lite, a concept so simple even the most inept would catch on: Dumb and Dumber with zombies! I mean what Hollywood Starbucks-lover could miss the concept of the fate of the world resting on two idiots, who are somehow immune to zombie infection? It was the same, but different. We have all these zombie movies, but what about a take where the heroes aren’t afraid of zombies? They’re too dumb to be afraid. What luck! This is it! Gold plated teeth, here I come!\n\n**I gave you this ten page backstory**\nto help make sense of the real problem going on here. The new screenplay discovery process is broken. If you skipped to this part, go back and read my story. I’m not any closer to selling a screenplay now than I was when I started this whole journey. I sat in bed the other day wanting to start a new script, wanting to get excited, and while I will start something. I’m not any surer of it finding success than I was of that first script thirteen years ago.\n\nI kept thinking about Mike Medavoy’s speculation about his produced work versus unproduced scripts. Think about it, every movie produced in a year represents one, five, or twenty decent  scripts passed over that may have found the same success as the chosen movie. That’s a lot of stories tucked away that could find life if they had a different platform for delivery.\n\nSome writers do break out. I read their stories and it encourages me to know it can be done, but what about the rest of us? Where do we fall on the scale between breakout-bidding-war-prodigy and don’t-set-pen-to-paper-ever-again? Gone are the spec script glory days of the nineties. The spec screenplay market is limping along on life support and the breaker has tripped.\n\nAs I sat debating over this conundrum I felt sad. Did I want to start another screenplay that wouldn’t sell, that nobody would read, and would only become another building block of my educational experiences? The answer is yes, because I enjoy writing screenplays. But it’s still depressing to write something that maybe a few people will read, then it will go to a shelf, or a hard drive, and sit until it dies.\n\nI know I’m far from being the only person in this position. Not getting paid for artistic work isn’t fun; all artists want that validation. But to not even have the option for people to discover your work is even worse. So many stories, tales, and adventures of imagination gathering dust out there across the globe that need to find an audience.\n\nI thought about it more, I could revise *Within* for the umpteenth time. I could do another draft of *Boobie Trip* (the zombie movie). I could start a new project, but I couldn’t get excited about any of it. I was tired of making art in a cave. I looked over at my Kindle sitting on the bed and thought, “Maybe I’ll convert Within into a novella for Kindle, then at least people can read it.”\n\n**The solution hit me like a runaway shuttle booster.**\nAn electrical storm of all the elements flashed in my mind: a new format, a new platform, an entirely different marketing strategy open to anyone — and it’s all possible right now.\n\nI tried to think of a name for this new format, a hybrid screenplay/novella type thing formatted for Kindle. A screenplay with slightly more exposition than normal, a screen-vella? A novell-play? No, it had to be something Amazon could pick up on and market. Then it hit me again - A Kindle Flick. You know: Kindle Fire, fire flames, flames FLICKer. Movies are FLICKs. Plus the Kindle formatting will make it a fast read, so you’ll be FLICKing your finger rapidly across the screen reading the action. It will feel like a book in fast forward. I wanted to call Amazon and scream, “Patch me through to Jeff Bezos!” But more ideas still needed to flow through the pipes.\n\n**The basic format is:**\nYou, the screenwriter, finish a screenplay, format it as a Kindle Flick, add exposition where necessary, and then have some fun with it:\n\n**Cast whomever you want to star in your Flick.**\nPick any actor, from any era, any age, and cast them in your story. Just specify: Tom is played by Marlon Brando - Streetcar. Jane is Meryl Streep - Kramer vs. Kramer. Young Stud is Chris Hemsworth. Any actors, any age, any era. Don’t waste time on lengthy character descriptions, just say who you thought of in your head while writing the script. If readers want to picture someone else, no problem.\n\n**Create a movie poster and tagline.**\nUse the beauty of Photoshop, Fiverr, or your own skills to create a wonderful poster for your Flick. The more intriguing the cast and the better the tagline, the more attention you drive to your wonderful script. It’s time for people to judge your screenplay by its cover, your concept; perfect for selling in the Kindle store.\n\n**Your script is out there.**\nInstead of wondering what’s wrong with your writing, or if you’ve got what it takes, the world can let you know with their clicks and dollars. Amazon already gives a preview, if people are clicking and not buying, you’ll know something needs to change. If people do buy your Flick, you’re making money while waiting to sign a deal and make even more money.\n\n**There are thousands (millions?) of screenplays sitting idle in filing cabinets and on hard drives all over the world.**\nWhile most probably aren’t that good (we all have our share) at least they don’t have to fade into oblivion. The screenplay as an art form needs more exposure. I argued with my creative writing professor (a novelist) that a well-written screenplay contains the same information as a short novel, with about ninety-percent less words. He disagreed. I guess he’s never read anything by Lawrence Kasdan.\n\n**Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube Red, Bollywood, or some other rising company may choose to pick up your property.**\nToday, as more companies produce entertainment outside the closed studio system, their options for finding material and talent should extend outside the closed agent system as well. There’s too many of us for the current agent system to process all of our input. Think it’s tough to get an agent? [Read just how ridiculous the system has become.](http://www.hollywoodinvestigator.com/2012/paradigm.html) Without an agent nobody is looking at your work, and that’s just fucking stupid.\n\n**Your work can speak for itself.**\nAs a writer you can enter screenplay competitions, or send query letters, or apply to film school, or you can do what you do best, sit and write. Let Amazon’s built-in rating and review system sift through the crap and allow the cream to rise. Your work can finally stand on its own merit. At least you’ll know where you fit and what to improve. You no longer have excuses as to why your work isn’t selling.\n\n**Your work will be published under your name.**\nNo more worrying about someone stealing your original ideas. It’s right there, on your Kindle Flick, with your name, and date published.\n\n**This will help agencies as well.**\nI don’t know the numbers, but I’ve heard rumors about warehouses and shipping containers in the bowels of Los Angeles full of unread scripts. We need to stop this flood of eager query letters and unsolicited screenplays into Hollywood. Let the material have a level playing field to be discovered. Face it, agents aren’t reading new scripts, well maybe they are, just not scripts from you or me. Let’s alleviate their pain and allow them to do what they do best — facilitate deals.\n\nI still imagine landing the six-figure whopper and then negotiating my second and third writing jobs with my trusty agent by my side. Do I want to negotiate? No. I want my agent to do the talking and buy me drinks afterward. Then I can retire to my hovel and write until my agent calls and asks me to step into the light to sign some papers. Agents deal. Writers write.\n\nThis will only reduce the burden on the U.S. Postal Service and the mailrooms of every agency, production company, and studio in town. I mean, the agencies have to feel some sort of guilt receiving and rejecting all those query letters day, after day, after day, don’t they? Don’t answer.\n\n**Most important of all.**\nFor some reason, we beginning screenwriters think we’re going to put a pen to paper and produce some masterpiece worth a hundred thousand dollars in two weeks. Maybe you’re that lucky, but get real. Screenwriting is a craft as much as any other trade. I could toss you all the tools, ladders, books, and videos about wiring commercial and residential buildings, but it wouldn’t make you an electrician. You would have to learn like anybody else.\n\nWe need to think about our screenplays like an artist thinks about their songs, some will be good, some great, some garbage. If you spend all your time revising and reworking that one great idea, you miss the opportunity to work on something better, maybe your number one hit. With the ability to instantly put your work in the marketplace you can forget about it and start something new. Maybe it will take off, maybe it won’t. Most importantly, you are spending time improving your craft instead of peddling your wares.\n\nYour work will be out there in the world, maybe making you money, maybe not, but at least you aren’t sitting there bitter and bitching about the Hollywood system (we’ve all been there), how it’s closed to outsiders, how if only you had the right connections you’d be famous. With Kindle Flick you have a system that can get you recognized based on skill alone, what more do you want?\n\n**If you still don’t think this is a good idea, consider the following:**\nNobody wants to buy your screenplay because you’re trying to sell it. It’s simple supply and demand economics. You aren’t just trying, you’re begging — you’re desperate. You have no leverage. \n\nLet’s say the agency represents the pretty girl in the house on the hill. Every day a thousand young suitors each bring the loveliest red rose they could grow to present to the girl in hopes that she’ll represent them, and help them sell their roses to the producer up in the castle. But guess what? She doesn’t give a shit, because a thousand people brought her a thousand roses yesterday, and a thousand the day before. She’s so sick of looking at goddamned roses, she wants to go play tennis. She also has her own fucking roses to worry about, so get the fuck off her property.\n\nSo the suitors need to do the respectable thing and take their roses to market, where people can look them over, and the people can decide who has the prettiest roses. Then, when someone in the market gains a name for himself as always having the loveliest roses, that pretty girl from the hill can march her ass on down and have a look. Better yet, this guy’s roses might be so good looking that another pretty girl in town wants a piece of the action. Well now they have to fight to get there first, and the guy offering the roses can raise his price. Now he has some leverage.\n\nAs long as we keep showing up every day with a thousand different roses, the negotiating power will always be in the hands of the producers and agencies.\n\nLet’s say you’ve won a couple screenplay competitions and you’re feeling pretty saucy. You think it’s time to contact a manager with a query letter. Let’s say the stars align and they read your query letter and request your script. Even better, people around town actually like your script. Guess what? Your wonderful script will never get made. It will get you working on someone else’s wonderful script. So where does your wonderful script go? On the shelf, in the closet, framed on the wall. Even if a studio buys it, they may never make it. So your story and hard work dies in the system. Only a handful of people will ever read it.\n\nBut if you put your story in the open market first, get it out there among the people, then it can build an audience, then it can gain some traction outside the Hollywood system, then it has a life of its own, even if it never gets made into a movie. But if it’s good, who knows? Maybe it will find its way to the big screen. But you get to decide where it goes, and many more people have a chance to enjoy your work, your imagination.\n\nOur work, our words, and our stories have value. Right now we find validation through sales, or winning competitions, or from our peers. While this is good, our works and stories have value just for existing. No script exists in the entertainment industry that didn’t start out in a writer’s imagination. We are the seeds. We are the creators that pull the unknown from the ether and transform it into a marketable idea. This is the power of the artist, not the businessman, or the accountant, or the CEO. This is us. By the power of Greyskull, we need to roll our screenplays up, hold them over our heads and shout, “We have the power!”\n\n**And lastly:**\nLet’s say this whole system is in place, the Kindle Flick section of the Kindle store. You write a brilliant script, create an even more brilliant poster, and top it off with a stellar tagline. Your Flick takes off in the Flick store and people throw their dollars your way just to read your script. Well your brilliant Flick will show up as hot and rising, and guess who’s watching that list? The pretty girls on the hill and also the producers in the castle. If they don’t snatch up this rising product someone else could. What do they do? It’s just out there. Anyone can see it. Everyone knows this thing is red hot. Shit, what if Netflix picks it up? What if Amazon takes it? What if Bollywood nabs it and turns it into a wonderful musical? Yesterday you were unknown, today EVERYONE is looking at your work and debating whether to buy. You will not get this kind of exposure no matter how many screenplay competitions you win, no matter how many query letters you send out, and no matter how many agents sign you. This system provides instant feedback. It’s time to get rid of the archaic spec screenplay system and advance to the modern age.\n\nIf you are an established screenwriter I’m sure you have a couple stories sitting around that haven’t gone anywhere that you don’t know what to do with. Don’t you think it’s time to be known for more than just your produced work? It’s time to showcase some of your crazier ideas, or your pet project that didn’t sell, or at least you can show people “This was my perfect script before they fucked it up!”\n\nIf you are an aspiring screenwriter what are your plans for your current project? More query letters? More money spent on screenplay competitions? More hoping for celestial intervention and getting an agent? More fretting whether or not your formatting is jyuuuuuussst right? You could be in this same position with your fourth or fifth screenplay in one, two, or ten years from now. Or you could put it up for sale on Amazon and see what happens. I can tell you from experience, that a deep fundamental change takes place in your writing when you know people are going to read it. When you hope someone will look at it, or you aren’t sure where it will end up, it’s kind of like that college writing assignment you weren’t really into. You thought it was your best, but it wasn’t your best. It wasn’t you. When you know people will read your work it changes you, it ups your game. It’s you on the page. Make this draft your best work and see what happens, anyone could read it.\n\nThink about it. It’s your work. Put the power in your hands. You deserve it.\n\n**Whew! I’m done, so please have a look. I made a few examples:**\nI feel it would be un-American to not try and sell something at the end of this lengthy infomercial, so I'll include links to two of my scripts, *Within* and *Boobie Trip,* setup as examples in the Kindle store.\n\nI contacted /u/skyecaptain over at /r/MoviePosterPorn to do the poster art. He was exceptional to work with and I recommend him highly. *Within* should be free from the 4th-8th, so please have at it. *Boobie Trip* is $2.99.\n\n(I know I just gave a lengthy discussion about the value of our work and have opted to give mine away for free and the price of a coffee.) I’m hoping you will all at least get the free one and give it a boost in the Kindle store. As it rises through the ranks it will give this idea more exposure to an audience outside of us screenwriters.\n\nIf you liked this post, please share a link on any screenwriting blogs or sites which allow that sort of thing. And thank you in advance for any payments received, my wife would love for me to replace her piano.\n\nAnd if you are into books, and you have stumbled on to this post from /r/books, please consider expanding your library to include unproduced screenplays. They make for a fast and exciting read — only what you see and what you hear — like a book stripped to just the action. Give it a try. You might be part of discovering the next big blockbuster.\n\n**tl;dr**  I was thinking about my next screenwriting project and decided we screenwriters need to democratize the spec script market.\n\nupdate: I know I'm posting this update at the same time as the original post, but I just need to share.\n\nI've had *Within* published with a poster cover on Kindle for a few days and have sold two copies. I also sold a copy of *Boobie Trip* before it even had a cover poster. (I published them both while waiting for the second poster to be finished)\n\nSo it does work, somebody out there took a chance on reading these scripts and paid money to do it. I'm not sure what will happen from here, but any money I make on them from now on is more than I would have made letting them sit around.\n",

I hope you find it encouraging with your current project, or to at least get some discussion about this topic going. Thanks for reading! (tl;dr at the end)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who am I?&lt;/strong&gt;\nThirteen years ago, on the day of my wedding reception, I decided I was going to make a movie. I had just discovered Robert Rodriguez’s Rebel Without a Crew and was reading it in between events. His story about the making of El Mariachi infused me with a sense of hope that I could tackle it all and make my own movie. I didn’t know why, but this idea wouldn’t leave me. It impressed itself so deeply in my psyche that I knew some sort of involvement in the film industry would be my life’s pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess the young optimist in me loved the challenge of the unknown. My friends all had plans for life: accountants, business degrees, fabricators at the steel plant. All labels and careers which put the minds of concerned parents, spouses, and in-laws at ease. I knew if I applied myself I could earn a bachelor’s degree and become an engineer, surveyor, teacher, or any one of those sure labels. But that all seemed so boring to me. I thought, I’m going to become a filmmaker, that’s the uncharted territory. I knew this meant I could attend four years of film school and end up waiting tables. A career in the arts was not a sure path, for some sick reason this appealed to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I started writing&lt;/strong&gt;\na script about a group of men, all tradesmen, who get the shaft from their boss when he attempts to fuse them to their tools and erase their memories, so they become half human, half machines that take on any job with ease. I was an electrician. My dad was an electrician. My grandpa was an electrician. My great-grandpa was an electrician. So I had access to all the goodies to create costumes, power tools, big crane shots, etc. I wanted to make a breakout film that would save me from my electrical destiny.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I created costumes, cast the movie, and arranged sets. My ever-optimistic mother even bought me the coveted Canon XL1s to shoot my masterpiece. We completed one day of shooting, then a half day, then our lead actor couldn’t come the next week because he was deer hunting. So “Handymen” died a victim of circumstance. I decided organizing all these people, building costumes, and shooting with no crew was a huge pain, so I’d stick to writing; just me, the blank page, and my unfettered imagination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I got a job maintaining a rest area&lt;/strong&gt;\nand it was perfect. The summers were busy, but during winter I had long uninterrupted hours to spend on my next project — an adaptation of Lee Nelson’s book about Mormon folklore hero Porter Rockwell. I set up a small work space in the maintenance closet of the rest area and began working to the soundtrack of industrial exhaust fans and flushing toilets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had no idea what I was doing. I just wanted to write and learn. I didn’t have permission from Lee Nelson. I figured that problem would work itself out over time. I spent countless hours day after day that winter kind of getting paid to write. During this time I also read Mike Medavoy’s &lt;em&gt;You’re Only as Good as Your Next One&lt;/em&gt; to learn about the producing side of the movie business. His most fascinating revelation to me was his speculation if he’d produced all the movies he turned down, and turned down all the movies he’d produced, he might have had the same amount of success. I thought that was crazy! So many stories up for consideration and then buried. But it appealed to me, and made sense. I wanted to be part of that crazy industry, in an at-least-I’m-not-a-dentist sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I got this wild idea&lt;/strong&gt;\nafter finishing Mike’s book to contact him and tell him I had an amazing screenplay called “Handymen”. I wrote a letter and told him I enjoyed his book, then made a small pitch at the end for my hot script.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I shit my pants when I received a phone call from Phoenix Pictures (on what must have been the same day he got my letter) requesting a copy of my script. I remember exactly where I was, on the cement steps of the front of the rest area. I hung up the phone and screamed. I ran all over jumping and shouting, “What luck! This is it! I followed my dream! This is my big break!” (luckily nobody was around) Then the reality hit that I had to send this script, the first script I’d ever written, to one of the most prolific producers in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I put the Rockwell adaptation aside and did a quick polish before sending off my million dollar, bidding-war-inducing masterpiece. I could feel success coming my way; a Hollywood prodigy arises!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I waited and waited. I made a follow up call, then another, then about a month later I received information that they had to pass, but wished me the best of luck. After I picked my ego up off the floor, I realized it’s not hard to get a script read in Hollywood; it’s hard to write a good script. Luckily, I had my hot adaptation in the works for my next opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My next pants-shitting event&lt;/strong&gt;\nhappened when I saw Lee Nelson himself was coming to do a book signing at the local library. What luck! How could it be that I chose to do this adaptation months ago, and now I would get to present a finished copy to the original author! He would love it and use his connections to make my beautiful adaptation happen! What a beautiful start to a screenwriting career! I finished the draft and headed into the library a few weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I met Lee Nelson, listened to his stories of killing buffalo from horseback, waited for him to sign autographs, then helped him gather up his boxes of books and take them to his truck. I figured I had brown-nosed enough to present my script. He listened to me, was excited? And then took a copy and told me he would be in touch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;More waiting for me, more ideas brewing, then news from Lee that my script was too heavy on exposition, too wordy, and needed better flow. “I based it on your book, asshole!” is what I wanted to say, but instead took his words into consideration and began revising. I think I sent him a second or third draft, but nothing came of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life and kids happened&lt;/strong&gt;\nso I stopped writing for awhile. I flipped a house, worked various construction jobs, always had my electrical background to pay the bills, and then one day I came across the hollow earth theory. Holy Shit! I have to make that into a screenplay! It’s like Indiana Jones for modern times! (I’m afraid my interest in conspiracy theories as seeds for more believable stories is often misconstrued as belief in conspiracies themselves, but I digress.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hollow earth theory blew my mind. YouTube was a thing now, so I could watch plenty of “proof” of hollow earth’s existence. I found the short story “The Smoky God” about a Norwegian sailor and his son mistakenly finding the opening to hollow earth and thought, “That’s it! My new adaptation!” So I began work on the public domain narrative (screw you, Lee Nelson!) while paralleling it with a modern day story about a college kid making the same journey inside the earth to find his lost parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This script would be my masterpiece, two movies in one, so many time changes, flashbacks, fades from the 1800’s to modern day, it would be so ahead of its time as a script, as a story, as an instant classic. I wrote, and read, and wrote, and read, and a few months later I had my first draft, the only draft I would need to break down the doors of Hollywood and establish myself as the next William Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided to contact my old buddy Mike again, because although he wasn’t interested in my first script, he at least told me why. Because of his feedback I learned. I became a better writer. I wasn’t left in the dark. It also helped that at this time Avatar was shattering box office records all over the place and I had an easy pitch as “Avatar set inside planet earth.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sent it. I waited. Mike responded that the multiple storylines, time changes, flashbacks, and time jumps confused the narrative, just too much of my own awesomeness (my words, not his). So I revised and sent it again. Mike responded that it was improved, but he respectfully had to pass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So there I was again, back where I started&lt;/strong&gt;\nmore beat down on one side, more built up on the other, more educated, less enthused, talking to Hollywood bigwigs, still as far away from Hollywood as possible. I decided to attend college and get a theater degree with a creative writing minor. It had been a long time since setting foot in an educational institution. I felt like I was conforming and giving in. I wanted to be that breakout writer who bucked the system, but at least I wasn’t working construction anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I soaked college in, Aristotle’s Elements? Would have been nice to know a few years ago. But by the end of my first year I started to feel the unscratched itch again, that goal implanted in my central being telling me it’s time to sell a screenplay, you won’t be happy until you do.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I picked up another screenwriting book to read, &lt;em&gt;Essentials of Screenwriting&lt;/em&gt; by Richard Walter. I figured now that I was on my way to a bachelor’s degree, maybe applying to UCLA’s screenwriting program wasn’t so unreachable. This Walter guy worked at UCLA; I figured I’d read his book.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I read the book, realized how bad my previous scripts sucked (there are others I haven’t mentioned), and decided my last script, the hollow earth one, was the only thing worth saving.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I started another draft&lt;/strong&gt;\nand by the time I finished Walter’s book, I knew I needed to revise again. So I did. I used my print credits to produce what was my first actual script that could be shown to someone. I realized how naive and foolish I’d been with those early scripts, those first drafts. We’ll call them building blocks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here I had a script, and flipping through the pages it looked like a script: a lot of white, properly formatted, a single narrative, and no flashbacks. At the end of Walter’s book was an “if you dare” invitation to send in a script for his consideration. What did I have to lose? All he can say is no, and I’d already been told no by the best in the business.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sent in the script. The third (or fourth?) shitting of my pants happened when I received a phone call from area code 301. Anybody outside Los Angeles knows that’s a heart stopper. I answered my cell and it was Richard Fucking Walter! Suddenly this person who wrote an actual book, that I could hold in my hand, that I bought from Amazon, was real. The world became a little smaller that day. I sat at my desk and maintained composure. He told me my script was good, it needed work, but it was an engaging story, and original. He said he sees a lot of scripts and doesn’t say that about many of them. I listened much and talked little. At the end of the conversation he made a proposal to work with me on the script and then help me with a referral. What luck! This is it! I thought all those previous times were it, but THIS IS IT!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I figured this was probably a once in a lifetime opportunity and if I said no I would forever wonder what if? I couldn’t live with that, so I said yes. After hanging up I jumped around, and screamed, and cheered, then I called my wife and told her I had to sell my guns, her piano, anything unnecessary, and I also needed our savings to pay for this educational experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What followed can only be described as a crash course in humility&lt;/strong&gt;\nI sent in my latest draft, waited a few weeks, and received a lengthy email with encouragement, positive feedback, and then a page-by-page analysis. This was invaluable. All the suggestions, ideas, rules, and guidelines I’d seen and read in so many screenwriting books suddenly made sense. I felt like I missed the point on all of them now seeing the “rules” applied directly to my writing. It was frustrating at times, but what did I know? I didn’t want to let my pride get in the way of learning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This exchange consumed almost a year of sending drafts, waiting for feedback, receiving feedback, another two months on a draft, etc. Through all of it I learned patience, and that the big sale, the mad bidding wars, the idea of a big payout was no longer my goal. Ha, ha, bullshit —  I tricked you. Of course I wanted to sell that thing and plate my teeth in gold, but really I wanted to become a better writer. I wanted the ability to notice these problems in my first draft, not my eighth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The time finally came&lt;/strong&gt;\nthat Richard felt I was ready for a referral. Now get this: this was an esteemed educator recommending me to an agent or manager. I didn’t know of a better referral other than saving a movie star’s dog from death on the freeway and telling them you need an agent. This had to be it! Of course Richard made no guarantees of a sale, and I understood. So away we went. I was put in contact with a manager and my professionally polished, millionth-draft script floated out on the town.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I waited and waited. I read Deadline. I expected to see a bidding war announced anytime soon. Just kidding, by this time I expected at most for my script to get me a writing assignment on another script, a revision or something.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Word came back to me. The feedback given was, “Your script is like black coffee. It needs to be more caramel macchiato.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What the mother fuck? Is that even feedback? I wanted to scream, “Your feedback is like shit! It needs to be more not like shit! And I happen to like black coffee! It’s solid. It does its job. People only add shit to coffee because they can’t handle the real deal, PANSIES! You want caramel macchiato? Go down to Starfucks and tell those hipster bitches you need a caramel macchi-fucking-enema!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But instead I said, “Thank you, I’ll work on another draft.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I spiced it up&lt;/strong&gt;\nand to be honest I can’t remember what happened after that. I think it went out again, or not. I think I was told to change some stuff on page thirty. Really? That’s going to seal the deal? I was now bored of working on &lt;em&gt;Within&lt;/em&gt; and wanted to start on a new project, something exciting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing feels better than leaving an overworked script behind for something shiny and fun. A new script idea is like a new girlfriend, you only see the fun parts until you’ve spent too much time with it. But I had a new idea, something goofy, something lite, a concept so simple even the most inept would catch on: Dumb and Dumber with zombies! I mean what Hollywood Starbucks-lover could miss the concept of the fate of the world resting on two idiots, who are somehow immune to zombie infection? It was the same, but different. We have all these zombie movies, but what about a take where the heroes aren’t afraid of zombies? They’re too dumb to be afraid. What luck! This is it! Gold plated teeth, here I come!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I gave you this ten page backstory&lt;/strong&gt;\nto help make sense of the real problem going on here. The new screenplay discovery process is broken. If you skipped to this part, go back and read my story. I’m not any closer to selling a screenplay now than I was when I started this whole journey. I sat in bed the other day wanting to start a new script, wanting to get excited, and while I will start something. I’m not any surer of it finding success than I was of that first script thirteen years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I kept thinking about Mike Medavoy’s speculation about his produced work versus unproduced scripts. Think about it, every movie produced in a year represents one, five, or twenty decent  scripts passed over that may have found the same success as the chosen movie. That’s a lot of stories tucked away that could find life if they had a different platform for delivery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some writers do break out. I read their stories and it encourages me to know it can be done, but what about the rest of us? Where do we fall on the scale between breakout-bidding-war-prodigy and don’t-set-pen-to-paper-ever-again? Gone are the spec script glory days of the nineties. The spec screenplay market is limping along on life support and the breaker has tripped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I sat debating over this conundrum I felt sad. Did I want to start another screenplay that wouldn’t sell, that nobody would read, and would only become another building block of my educational experiences? The answer is yes, because I enjoy writing screenplays. But it’s still depressing to write something that maybe a few people will read, then it will go to a shelf, or a hard drive, and sit until it dies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know I’m far from being the only person in this position. Not getting paid for artistic work isn’t fun; all artists want that validation. But to not even have the option for people to discover your work is even worse. So many stories, tales, and adventures of imagination gathering dust out there across the globe that need to find an audience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about it more, I could revise &lt;em&gt;Within&lt;/em&gt; for the umpteenth time. I could do another draft of &lt;em&gt;Boobie Trip&lt;/em&gt; (the zombie movie). I could start a new project, but I couldn’t get excited about any of it. I was tired of making art in a cave. I looked over at my Kindle sitting on the bed and thought, “Maybe I’ll convert Within into a novella for Kindle, then at least people can read it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The solution hit me like a runaway shuttle booster.&lt;/strong&gt;\nAn electrical storm of all the elements flashed in my mind: a new format, a new platform, an entirely different marketing strategy open to anyone — and it’s all possible right now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to think of a name for this new format, a hybrid screenplay/novella type thing formatted for Kindle. A screenplay with slightly more exposition than normal, a screen-vella? A novell-play? No, it had to be something Amazon could pick up on and market. Then it hit me again - A Kindle Flick. You know: Kindle Fire, fire flames, flames FLICKer. Movies are FLICKs. Plus the Kindle formatting will make it a fast read, so you’ll be FLICKing your finger rapidly across the screen reading the action. It will feel like a book in fast forward. I wanted to call Amazon and scream, “Patch me through to Jeff Bezos!” But more ideas still needed to flow through the pipes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The basic format is:&lt;/strong&gt;\nYou, the screenwriter, finish a screenplay, format it as a Kindle Flick, add exposition where necessary, and then have some fun with it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cast whomever you want to star in your Flick.&lt;/strong&gt;\nPick any actor, from any era, any age, and cast them in your story. Just specify: Tom is played by Marlon Brando - Streetcar. Jane is Meryl Streep - Kramer vs. Kramer. Young Stud is Chris Hemsworth. Any actors, any age, any era. Don’t waste time on lengthy character descriptions, just say who you thought of in your head while writing the script. If readers want to picture someone else, no problem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a movie poster and tagline.&lt;/strong&gt;\nUse the beauty of Photoshop, Fiverr, or your own skills to create a wonderful poster for your Flick. The more intriguing the cast and the better the tagline, the more attention you drive to your wonderful script. It’s time for people to judge your screenplay by its cover, your concept; perfect for selling in the Kindle store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your script is out there.&lt;/strong&gt;\nInstead of wondering what’s wrong with your writing, or if you’ve got what it takes, the world can let you know with their clicks and dollars. Amazon already gives a preview, if people are clicking and not buying, you’ll know something needs to change. If people do buy your Flick, you’re making money while waiting to sign a deal and make even more money.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are thousands (millions?) of screenplays sitting idle in filing cabinets and on hard drives all over the world.&lt;/strong&gt;\nWhile most probably aren’t that good (we all have our share) at least they don’t have to fade into oblivion. The screenplay as an art form needs more exposure. I argued with my creative writing professor (a novelist) that a well-written screenplay contains the same information as a short novel, with about ninety-percent less words. He disagreed. I guess he’s never read anything by Lawrence Kasdan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon, Netflix, Hulu, YouTube Red, Bollywood, or some other rising company may choose to pick up your property.&lt;/strong&gt;\nToday, as more companies produce entertainment outside the closed studio system, their options for finding material and talent should extend outside the closed agent system as well. There’s too many of us for the current agent system to process all of our input. Think it’s tough to get an agent? &lt;a href=\"http://www.hollywoodinvestigator.com/2012/paradigm.html\"&gt;Read just how ridiculous the system has become.&lt;/a&gt; Without an agent nobody is looking at your work, and that’s just fucking stupid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your work can speak for itself.&lt;/strong&gt;\nAs a writer you can enter screenplay competitions, or send query letters, or apply to film school, or you can do what you do best, sit and write. Let Amazon’s built-in rating and review system sift through the crap and allow the cream to rise. Your work can finally stand on its own merit. At least you’ll know where you fit and what to improve. You no longer have excuses as to why your work isn’t selling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your work will be published under your name.&lt;/strong&gt;\nNo more worrying about someone stealing your original ideas. It’s right there, on your Kindle Flick, with your name, and date published.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This will help agencies as well.&lt;/strong&gt;\nI don’t know the numbers, but I’ve heard rumors about warehouses and shipping containers in the bowels of Los Angeles full of unread scripts. We need to stop this flood of eager query letters and unsolicited screenplays into Hollywood. Let the material have a level playing field to be discovered. Face it, agents aren’t reading new scripts, well maybe they are, just not scripts from you or me. Let’s alleviate their pain and allow them to do what they do best — facilitate deals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I still imagine landing the six-figure whopper and then negotiating my second and third writing jobs with my trusty agent by my side. Do I want to negotiate? No. I want my agent to do the talking and buy me drinks afterward. Then I can retire to my hovel and write until my agent calls and asks me to step into the light to sign some papers. Agents deal. Writers write.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will only reduce the burden on the U.S. Postal Service and the mailrooms of every agency, production company, and studio in town. I mean, the agencies have to feel some sort of guilt receiving and rejecting all those query letters day, after day, after day, don’t they? Don’t answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most important of all.&lt;/strong&gt;\nFor some reason, we beginning screenwriters think we’re going to put a pen to paper and produce some masterpiece worth a hundred thousand dollars in two weeks. Maybe you’re that lucky, but get real. Screenwriting is a craft as much as any other trade. I could toss you all the tools, ladders, books, and videos about wiring commercial and residential buildings, but it wouldn’t make you an electrician. You would have to learn like anybody else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We need to think about our screenplays like an artist thinks about their songs, some will be good, some great, some garbage. If you spend all your time revising and reworking that one great idea, you miss the opportunity to work on something better, maybe your number one hit. With the ability to instantly put your work in the marketplace you can forget about it and start something new. Maybe it will take off, maybe it won’t. Most importantly, you are spending time improving your craft instead of peddling your wares.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Your work will be out there in the world, maybe making you money, maybe not, but at least you aren’t sitting there bitter and bitching about the Hollywood system (we’ve all been there), how it’s closed to outsiders, how if only you had the right connections you’d be famous. With Kindle Flick you have a system that can get you recognized based on skill alone, what more do you want?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you still don’t think this is a good idea, consider the following:&lt;/strong&gt;\nNobody wants to buy your screenplay because you’re trying to sell it. It’s simple supply and demand economics. You aren’t just trying, you’re begging — you’re desperate. You have no leverage. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s say the agency represents the pretty girl in the house on the hill. Every day a thousand young suitors each bring the loveliest red rose they could grow to present to the girl in hopes that she’ll represent them, and help them sell their roses to the producer up in the castle. But guess what? She doesn’t give a shit, because a thousand people brought her a thousand roses yesterday, and a thousand the day before. She’s so sick of looking at goddamned roses, she wants to go play tennis. She also has her own fucking roses to worry about, so get the fuck off her property.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So the suitors need to do the respectable thing and take their roses to market, where people can look them over, and the people can decide who has the prettiest roses. Then, when someone in the market gains a name for himself as always having the loveliest roses, that pretty girl from the hill can march her ass on down and have a look. Better yet, this guy’s roses might be so good looking that another pretty girl in town wants a piece of the action. Well now they have to fight to get there first, and the guy offering the roses can raise his price. Now he has some leverage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As long as we keep showing up every day with a thousand different roses, the negotiating power will always be in the hands of the producers and agencies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’ve won a couple screenplay competitions and you’re feeling pretty saucy. You think it’s time to contact a manager with a query letter. Let’s say the stars align and they read your query letter and request your script. Even better, people around town actually like your script. Guess what? Your wonderful script will never get made. It will get you working on someone else’s wonderful script. So where does your wonderful script go? On the shelf, in the closet, framed on the wall. Even if a studio buys it, they may never make it. So your story and hard work dies in the system. Only a handful of people will ever read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if you put your story in the open market first, get it out there among the people, then it can build an audience, then it can gain some traction outside the Hollywood system, then it has a life of its own, even if it never gets made into a movie. But if it’s good, who knows? Maybe it will find its way to the big screen. But you get to decide where it goes, and many more people have a chance to enjoy your work, your imagination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our work, our words, and our stories have value. Right now we find validation through sales, or winning competitions, or from our peers. While this is good, our works and stories have value just for existing. No script exists in the entertainment industry that didn’t start out in a writer’s imagination. We are the seeds. We are the creators that pull the unknown from the ether and transform it into a marketable idea. This is the power of the artist, not the businessman, or the accountant, or the CEO. This is us. By the power of Greyskull, we need to roll our screenplays up, hold them over our heads and shout, “We have the power!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And lastly:&lt;/strong&gt;\nLet’s say this whole system is in place, the Kindle Flick section of the Kindle store. You write a brilliant script, create an even more brilliant poster, and top it off with a stellar tagline. Your Flick takes off in the Flick store and people throw their dollars your way just to read your script. Well your brilliant Flick will show up as hot and rising, and guess who’s watching that list? The pretty girls on the hill and also the producers in the castle. If they don’t snatch up this rising product someone else could. What do they do? It’s just out there. Anyone can see it. Everyone knows this thing is red hot. Shit, what if Netflix picks it up? What if Amazon takes it? What if Bollywood nabs it and turns it into a wonderful musical? Yesterday you were unknown, today EVERYONE is looking at your work and debating whether to buy. You will not get this kind of exposure no matter how many screenplay competitions you win, no matter how many query letters you send out, and no matter how many agents sign you. This system provides instant feedback. It’s time to get rid of the archaic spec screenplay system and advance to the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are an established screenwriter I’m sure you have a couple stories sitting around that haven’t gone anywhere that you don’t know what to do with. Don’t you think it’s time to be known for more than just your produced work? It’s time to showcase some of your crazier ideas, or your pet project that didn’t sell, or at least you can show people “This was my perfect script before they fucked it up!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you are an aspiring screenwriter what are your plans for your current project? More query letters? More money spent on screenplay competitions? More hoping for celestial intervention and getting an agent? More fretting whether or not your formatting is jyuuuuuussst right? You could be in this same position with your fourth or fifth screenplay in one, two, or ten years from now. Or you could put it up for sale on Amazon and see what happens. I can tell you from experience, that a deep fundamental change takes place in your writing when you know people are going to read it. When you hope someone will look at it, or you aren’t sure where it will end up, it’s kind of like that college writing assignment you weren’t really into. You thought it was your best, but it wasn’t your best. It wasn’t you. When you know people will read your work it changes you, it ups your game. It’s you on the page. Make this draft your best work and see what happens, anyone could read it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Think about it. It’s your work. Put the power in your hands. You deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whew! I’m done, so please have a look. I made a few examples:&lt;/strong&gt;\nI feel it would be un-American to not try and sell something at the end of this lengthy infomercial, so I&amp;#39;ll include links to two of my scripts, &lt;em&gt;Within&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Boobie Trip,&lt;/em&gt; setup as examples in the Kindle store.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I contacted &lt;a href=\"/u/skyecaptain\"&gt;/u/skyecaptain&lt;/a&gt; over at &lt;a href=\"/r/MoviePosterPorn\"&gt;/r/MoviePosterPorn&lt;/a&gt; to do the poster art. He was exceptional to work with and I recommend him highly. &lt;em&gt;Within&lt;/em&gt; should be free from the 4th-8th, so please have at it. &lt;em&gt;Boobie Trip&lt;/em&gt; is $2.99.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(I know I just gave a lengthy discussion about the value of our work and have opted to give mine away for free and the price of a coffee.) I’m hoping you will all at least get the free one and give it a boost in the Kindle store. As it rises through the ranks it will give this idea more exposure to an audience outside of us screenwriters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you liked this post, please share a link on any screenwriting blogs or sites which allow that sort of thing. And thank you in advance for any payments received, my wife would love for me to replace her piano.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if you are into books, and you have stumbled on to this post from &lt;a href=\"/r/books\"&gt;/r/books&lt;/a&gt;, please consider expanding your library to include unproduced screenplays. They make for a fast and exciting read — only what you see and what you hear — like a book stripped to just the action. Give it a try. You might be part of discovering the next big blockbuster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr&lt;/strong&gt;  I was thinking about my next screenwriting project and decided we screenwriters need to democratize the spec script market.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;update: I know I&amp;#39;m posting this update at the same time as the original post, but I just need to share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had &lt;em&gt;Within&lt;/em&gt; published with a poster cover on Kindle for a few days and have sold two copies. I also sold a copy of &lt;em&gt;Boobie Trip&lt;/em&gt; before it even had a cover poster. (I published them both while waiting for the second poster to be finished)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So it does work, somebody out there took a chance on reading these scripts and paid money to do it. I&amp;#39;m not sure what will happen from here, but any money I make on them from now on is more than I would have made letting them sit around.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Total fourth quarter sales increased 3.8% to $124 million and full year sales increased 6.8% to $442.2 million. The company’s DXL stores drove the increase with comps up 9.7% on the year.  Despite improved sales, the company reported a loss of $1.4 million, or three cents a share, in the fourth quarter compared to a prior year profit of $1.6 million, or three cents a share. The net loss for the year was $8.4 million, of 17 cents a share, compared to a loss of $12.3 million, or 25 cents a share, the prior year.\n \n \n**New York &amp; Company in outlet overdrive**\nMARCH 18, 2016,  Specialty apparel retailer New York &amp; Company plans to convert even more of its nearly 500 stores to an outlet format following a strong finish to the year.\n \nNew York &amp; Company ended the year with a total of 490 stores, of which 82 locations are outlet stores. This year, the company plans a further repositioning of its portfolio toward the outlet concept with 50 existing New York &amp; Company stores due for conversion to outlet stores in the first quarter. The company also plans to open one new outlet while closing between eight and 12 New York &amp; Company stores following the closure of 18 store in 2015. At the end of current fiscal year, the company expects to have more than one fourth, or 133 stores out of a total footprint of between 481 to 485 stores, in the outlet format. Those efforts are expected to yield 2016 same store sales growth in the low single digits, following a similar performance in 2015 when comps grew 3.1%. Total 2015 sales were $950.1 million, compared to prior year sales of $923.3 million.\nDepartment Stores\n \n**Nordstrom Rack to add two more locations**\nMARCH 25, 2016, The off-price division of Nordstrom plans to open a new store in the nation’s capital, and another in Texas.\n \nNordstrom Rack will open at District Center in the heart of Washington, D.C. The approximately 37,000 sq.-ft., two-level store, is scheduled to open in fall 2016, will be the retailer's thirteenth Nordstrom Rack in Washington, D.C./Baltimore area having first opened in the area at Potomac Mills in Woodbridge, Virginia in 1990.\n \n  \n**Meijer confirms purchase of land in Minneapolis suburb**\nMarch 21, 2016,  BROOKLYN PARK, MINN - Meijer Inc. is confirming the acquisition of 30 acres in an Minneapolis suburb.\n \nThe Michigan big-box retailer doesn't have any immediate plans for the property or entering the Minnesota market, said Frank Guglielgmi, Meijer's senior director of communications. Meijer just launched its $750 million expansion into neighboring Wisconsin that will put 16 supercenter stores in the state by 2019.\n \n \n**Gordmans to open five stores in 2016**\nMARCH 18, 2016,  Gordmans Stores plans to open a new store next month in its hometown of Omaha in April, the first of five new units the apparel and home décor retailer has planned for the year.\n \nGordmans launched its e-commerce site last year and opened six new stores to end the year with 102 locations while turning in a weak sales and profit performance. The addition of selling space enabled the company to increase sales 0.9% to $205.7 million while same-store sales decreased 2.2% during the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30. Net income for period fell to $1.1 million, six cents a share, from $2.3 million, or 12 cents a share, the prior year. Gordmans ended 2015 with total sales of $649 million, an increase of 2.3% from the prior year, while same-store sales declined 1.2%. The company reported a loss of $4.3 million, or 22 cents a share, compared to a prior year loss of $3.5 million, or 18 cents a share.\n \n\n-----------------------------------------------\n**Discount Stores**\n \nFred's announces new chairman alongside Q4, 2015 results\nMARCH 23, 2016,  Fred’s on Wednesday reported its Q4 and FY2015 earnings, as well as the news that board chairman Michael Hayes would be stepping down, to be replaced with longtime director Thomas Tashjian.\n \nThe company’s quarterly earnings hit $554.5 million a 10% increase over the same period last year. This increase grows to 14% when sales from stores that largely closed in Q4 2014 are discounted. Comparable store sales grew by 1.7%, and net loss for the quarter was $3.9 million, compared to an $8.2 million loss in the same period last year — a difference Fred’s attributed to the cost of store closures and provisions for inventory reserves. Gross profit for the quarter increased 7% to $132.9 million, and its adjusted diluted earnings per share — $0.02 — reflected a 250% increase over Q4 2014. Gross margin dropped from 27% in Q4 2014 to 25% this year, which the company attributes to growth among specialty pharmacy, which is a low-margin category.  From a full-year perspective, Fred’s $2.15 billion total sales reflected a 9% increase over the entirety of FY2014, a number that grows to 13% over last year when excluding $71.7 million in sales from stores that were closed in 2015. Comps increased 1.5% for the full year — compared to a loss of 0.6% in FY2014 — and gross profit grew to $551.6 million, an increase of 3% over last year.\n \n \n**Five Below ramping up store growth**\nMARCH 23, 2016 ,  Five Below is accelerating new store growth again this year.  The tween and teen retailer shared a long-range profit forecast which indicates it expects accelerating growth to be a recurring theme. It plans to open 85 new stores this year, adding to its base of 437 units.\n \nA net increase of 71 new stores last year – on top of 62 units the prior year – enabled Five Below to increase sales 23.7% to $326.4 million in the fourth quarter and 22.3% to $832 million during the fiscal year ended Jan. 30. Also contributing to the top line growth was a fourth quarter same store sales increase of 3.6% and a full year increase of 3.4%.  Profits increased 26.1% to $42 million, or 77 cents a share, compared to $33.3 million, or 61 cents a share, during the fourth quarter the prior year. Full year profits increased 20.1% to $57.7 million, or $1.05 a share, compared to $48 million, or 88 cents a share.\n \n \n**Kohl’s Reveals Store Closure List**\nMarch 21, 2016,  After a disappointing fourth quarter that saw profits drop 20 percent, the 1,164 store-Kohl’s Corporation has released the names of 18 underperforming stores that will close this year. Half will be in California, including seven concentrated in southern California. The remainder are in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.\n \nAll will close by June 19, with the exception of one store in Georgia slated to close on November 1.  The Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based retail chain announced plans to shutter 18 underperforming stores on February 25, when it released disappointing financials for the quarter ending January 30—a period that included the normally robust holiday shopping season. At the same time, the retailer confirmed its plans to open seven, smaller-format stores in 2016, as well as a dozen Fila outlets, and two Off/Aisle stores.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n**Grocery Stores**\n \n**Publix making first push into Greater Washington**\nMar 23, 2016, Publix, a Florida-based grocer with a cult-like following in the south, has hired a local broker and appears to ready to enter the D.C. market. The company had a booth at the International Council of Shopping Centers’ Mid-Atlantic Dealmaking and Conference event last week at National Harbor. It was the first time Publix has had a presence at the event, which connects landlords with potential retailers.\n  \nPublix spokeswoman Kim Reynolds confirmed the chain is looking to open stores throughout Virginia, including in Northern Virginia, although she said could not speak to the District or other parts of the Washington region specifically. The company's presence at the expo created quite a buzz, with attendees saying its booth was mobbed for much of the day. Publix held several meetings with brokers and other conference goers.\n \n \n**Martin's** reportedly selling its 19 stores in the Richmond area as part of merger\nMarch 21, 2016,  The 19 Martin’s Food Markets stores in the Richmond region likely will be sold or closed this year as part of a planned merger, according to an industry trade publication.  The Kroger and/or Publix supermarket chains could be the likely buyer of those stores.\n \n \nThe sale of the Martin’s stores would be needed to satisfy federal regulators so Dutch retail conglomerate Royal Ahold NV — which operates U.S. supermarket chains Martin’s, Giant and Stop &amp; Shop — can combine this year with its Belgian counterpart Delhaize Group, which owns Food Lion and Hannaford stores. Shareholders of both companies approved the deal last week.\n \n \n**83 Ahold-Delhaize stores for sale: Report**\nMar 21, 2016,  An industry trade paper on Monday published a list of 83 stores that it reported Ahold and Delhaize are seeking to sell as part of their forthcoming merger, including all 20 Martin's stores in the Richmond area. Ahold and Delhaize officials have not commented on the report, but have acknowledged stores would likely be divested so as to receive antitrust approval for their deal to close. The FTC had not commented as of late Monday.\n \n \n\"As part of any merger approval process where there may be store divestitures, store visits may be conducted by potential buyers but it's too early to speculate on the outcome of the FTC review process,\" Christopher Brand, an Ahold spokesman, told SN Monday. Christy Phillips-Brown, a spokeswoman for Delhaize's Food Lion chain, in a statement said \"Delhaize does not comment on pending regulatory matters or on market speculation.\"\n \n \n \n**Union: 8 Giant stores to be sold in merger**\nMar 21, 2016,  A trade union representing workers at Giant-Landover stores in the metro Washington area have informed members that eight stores where its members work could be sold in order to meet antitrust approval of the Ahold-Delhaize deal.\n \n The Ahold-owned stores, which compete with nearby Food Lion locations operated by Delhaize, are located in Accokeek and La Plata, Md.; and in Stafford (two locations), Fredericksburg (two locations), Spotsylvania and Falmouth, Va., according to United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400.\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n**Home Improvement &amp; Office Products**\n \n**Staples and Office Depot take another shot at FTC**\nMARCH 18, 2016,  The CEOs of Staples and Office Depot penned a letter to customers which reveals the extent of their deteriorated relations with the Federal Trade Commission ahead of a hearing that begins March 21 that will determine whether the retailers are allowed to merge.  In the letter, Staples chairman and CEO Ron Sargent and Office Depot chairman and CEO Roland Smith stop short of actually calling the FTC stupid, but that is the inference from more diplomatically worded prose.\n \n“The FTC’s actions to stop this transaction are based on a flawed analysis of the marketplace and a deep misunderstanding of the competitive landscape,” Sargent and Smith state in the letter. “The FTC has cherry picked a few facts to fit its narrative and support its case. In making its case, the FTC refuses to even acknowledge the rise of new competitors, such as Amazon, and the disruptive effects of the digital economy.”  “The FTC continues to act against the best interests of the hundreds of thousands of business customers, and millions of everyday consumers who will benefit from the acquisition,” according to the letter. “The FTC is simply wrong. The combination of Staples and Office Depot is good for customers.”\n \nThe acquisition has been approved in Australia, New Zealand, China and the European Union, subject to a divesture. To try to meet the FTC’s requirements, Staples recently entered into an agreement with Essendant to divest more than $550 million of wholesale business subject to the successful completion of the merger.\nRestaurant\n \n**Hospitality turnover rose to 72.1% in 2015**\nMar 23, 2016,  Official numbers are beginning to emerge that confirm what restaurant operators already knew: Turnover rates have been pushing higher.  The turnover rate in the economy’s hospitality segment in 2015 rose to 72.1 percent, up from 66.7 percent in 2014, according to a recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report. It was the fifth consecutive year of turnover rate increases.\n \nBruce Grindy, chief economist for the National Restaurant Association, posted this week that turnover rates remained below the pre-recession high of 80.7 percent in 2007, but the 2015 rate was more than 15 percentage points higher than the 56.4 percent logged in 2010. The bureau does not report data solely for restaurants but uses a broader “accommodations and foodservices” sector. The average turnover rate for all private-sector workers stood at 45.9 percent in 2015. Grindy noted that remained lower than the average turnover rate of 50 percent during the 2002–2006 period.\n \n \n**Krispy Kreme looks to expand franchising**\nMar 23, 2016,  Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. believes it would be better off if someone else built and operated its shops.\n \nThe Winston Salem, N.C.-based doughnut chain plans to focus more exclusively on franchising in the coming years, executives said during the company’s earnings call Tuesday. Their reason is simple: Franchisees have been doing a better job than the company at operating the chain’s locations.\n \n \nKrispy Kreme profit rises 26% on sales growth\nMar 22, 2016,  Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. said Tuesday that its net income rose 26 percent in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, as the chain’s same-store sales continued to grow.\n \nSystemwide same-store sales rose 1.6 percent in the quarter and 3.9 percent for the year. Company same-store sales rose 2.4 percent for the year, the seventh straight year of growth. The chain's same-store sales didn't meet Wall Street expectations, and the stock was down 6 percent after hours. Net income was $8.2 million in the fourth quarter, or 13 cents per share, rising from $6.5 million, or 10 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings rose 14 percent, to 22 cents per share, from 17 cents per share. For the year, revenues increased 5.8 percent, to $518.7 million, from $490.3 million. The company expects to open 30 new domestic units, along with 120 to 140 international locations. It also expects flat commodity costs offset by higher labor costs.\n \n**Restaurant analysts cautiously optimistic on Texas**\nMar 22, 2016,  Declining oil prices are muffling restaurant sales gains in some Texas markets, but equity analysts are cautiously optimistic on economic trends in the Lone Star State. Analyst reports from Baird Equity Research and Maxim Group noted strengths in the state’s economy despite downward pressures in the oil sector, which led some public restaurant companies to start expressing concerns last fall.\n \nThe National Restaurant Association 2016 Forecast, released in February, projected a 3.8-percent increase in sales in Texas, reaching $52.4 billion this year, rising from $50.4 billion in 2015. Texas ranked second in total restaurant sales behind California, which is expected to reach $79.1 billion in 2016. The NRA forecast the total national rate of increase in restaurant industry sales would be 5 percent in 2016.\n \n \n**Red Robin** acquires 13 franchised units\nMar 21, 2016,  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc. has acquired 13 of its franchised restaurants in Texas with plans to expand further into that market, the company said Monday.\n \nTerms of the deal were not disclosed, but the company has completed the purchase of seven Red Robin units in Houston; two in Dallas; and one restaurant respectively in Lubbock, Austin, Abilene and Amarillo. The sellers included Cowboy Red LC; Cowgirl Red LLC; Texas Red Real Estate Ltd and affiliates; Robert Reynolds and Carolyn Frost Keenan.\n \n \n**Blaze Pizza** triples sales in 2015\nMar 18, 2016,  Blaze Fast-Fire’d Pizza reported same-store sales growth of 7 percent for fiscal 2015, the company said Friday. The Pasadena, Calif.-based chain also tripled its sales for the Dec. 27-ended year to $101 million, compared with $33 million in fiscal 2014, with both numbers including sales by franchised units as reported to the company.\n \nBlaze ended fiscal 2015 with 105 units, more than double the 50 units open at the end of 2014. Currently the chain has 116 locations open and Blaze expects to open another 96 units over the next 12 months, including expansion into 10 new states and markets in Boston, Denver, Salt Lake City, Phoenix and Atlanta.\n \n-----------------------------------------------\n**Dollar Stores, Warehouse Club &amp; Other Retailers**\n \n \n**GameStop** emerges victorious from transitional 2015\nMARCH 25, 2016,  GameStop's efforts to generate growth by diversifying its business model worked well in 2015, as the video game retailer posted its third straight year of positive comps.\n \nThe Texas-based company said that for the full fiscal year of 2015 ended on Jan. 30, total sales were $9.36 billion, a 0.7% increase over 2014. Same-store sales increased 4.3% (a 4.8% increase in the U.S. and a 3% increase internationally) compared to fiscal 2014, primarily driven by sales of video game accessories, pre-owned products and collectibles. GameStop's fiscal 2015 net earnings were $402.8 million. For the fourth quarter, profit at GameStop was $247.8 million, or $2.36 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $244.1 million, or $2.23 a share. Revenue rose 1.4% to $3.52 billion. Same-store sales grew 3.1%.\n \n \n**Dollar General** to open 1,000 stores in 2017\nMARCH 24, 2016,  Dollar General will break its own record for store expansion in 2017. And that’s saying a lot. The discounter is already in high gear, with plans to open a record 900 stores and remodel or relocate about 875 existing locations in 2016. But it’s upping the total for 2017, forecasting some 1,000 new stores and 900 remodels or relocations, which is in line with its model of 6% to 8% square footage growth.\n \n \nIn 2015, Dollar General opened 730 new stores and remodeled or relocated 881 stores which combined with a 2.8% same-store sales increase allowed it to grow total sales 7.7% to $20.4 billion. The company ended its fiscal year on Jan. 29, with 12,483 stores. Dollar General revealed its plans for 2017 late Wednesday, on the eve of the company’s March 24 investor conference. In addition to the heightened level of new store growth and remodeling activity, ahead of the meeting the company shared an update on other key initiatives and performance assumptions.\n \n \n**Sportsman’s Warehouse** hunts for growth with more new stores\nMARCH 24, 2016, Sportsman’s Warehouse Holdings announced plans for its most ambitious expansion program ever with 11 new stores planned for 2016 following a strong fourth quarter performance.\n \nThe Midvale, Utah-based operator of 64 stores focused on the categories of hunting, fishing and camping, opened nine stores last year which combined with its strong fourth quarter showing enabled the company to produce record results. The addition of 11 stores this year will give the company, which went public in April 2014, 75 locations in 20 predominantly Western states and Alaska. Fourth quarter net income, adjusted to exclude non-recurring litigation and loan refinancing costs, increased 25.3% to $11.4 million, or 27 cents a share, from $9.1 million, or 22 cents a share, in the fourth quarter the prior year. Full year adjusted net income, which also excludes expenses related to a secondary stock offering in the third quarter of 2015, increased 22.3% to $25.8 million, or 61 cents a share, from $21.1 million, or 50 cents a share.\n \n \n \nSignet shines in Q4, ramps up store expansion\nMARCH 24, 2016, Signet Jewelers is already the world’s largest retailer of diamond jewelry and it plans to get even bigger in 2016 by accelerating new store and omnichannel growth. The news came as the chain reported a same-store sales increase of 4.9% in the fourth quarter.\nOperating stores under banners such as Kay, Jared and Zale, Signet expects to increase square footage by 3% to 3.5% in 2016, compared to an earlier forecast of 2% to 3% growth. That translates to new store opening in the range of 145 to 178 units for a net increase minus closures of between 61 and 87 units on store based of 3,625 unit at the end of its fiscal year on Jan. 30.\n \n \nSporting goods retailer in two big city openings\nMARCH 21, 2016,  **Modell’s Sporting Goods** continues to grow its brick-and-mortar footprint. The New York-based company has added two more stores to its portfolio, one in Boston and the other in Philadelphia. Both stores are in prime locations formerly occupied by City Sports. (City Sports filed for bankruptcy in October 2016, and subsequently announced it would close all locations.)\n \nIn Boston, Modell’s opened an 11,000-sq.-ft. store on Boylston Street, in the city’s Back Bay area. It’s the retailer’s first outpost in downtown Boston.",

Total fourth quarter sales increased 3.8% to $124 million and full year sales increased 6.8% to $442.2 million. The company’s DXL stores drove the increase with comps up 9.7% on the year.  Despite improved sales, the company reported a loss of $1.4 million, or three cents a share, in the fourth quarter compared to a prior year profit of $1.6 million, or three cents a share. The net loss for the year was $8.4 million, of 17 cents a share, compared to a loss of $12.3 million, or 25 cents a share, the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New York &amp;amp; Company in outlet overdrive&lt;/strong&gt;\nMARCH 18, 2016,  Specialty apparel retailer New York &amp;amp; Company plans to convert even more of its nearly 500 stores to an outlet format following a strong finish to the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New York &amp;amp; Company ended the year with a total of 490 stores, of which 82 locations are outlet stores. This year, the company plans a further repositioning of its portfolio toward the outlet concept with 50 existing New York &amp;amp; Company stores due for conversion to outlet stores in the first quarter. The company also plans to open one new outlet while closing between eight and 12 New York &amp;amp; Company stores following the closure of 18 store in 2015. At the end of current fiscal year, the company expects to have more than one fourth, or 133 stores out of a total footprint of between 481 to 485 stores, in the outlet format. Those efforts are expected to yield 2016 same store sales growth in the low single digits, following a similar performance in 2015 when comps grew 3.1%. Total 2015 sales were $950.1 million, compared to prior year sales of $923.3 million.\nDepartment Stores&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nordstrom Rack to add two more locations&lt;/strong&gt;\nMARCH 25, 2016, The off-price division of Nordstrom plans to open a new store in the nation’s capital, and another in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nordstrom Rack will open at District Center in the heart of Washington, D.C. The approximately 37,000 sq.-ft., two-level store, is scheduled to open in fall 2016, will be the retailer&amp;#39;s thirteenth Nordstrom Rack in Washington, D.C./Baltimore area having first opened in the area at Potomac Mills in Woodbridge, Virginia in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meijer confirms purchase of land in Minneapolis suburb&lt;/strong&gt;\nMarch 21, 2016,  BROOKLYN PARK, MINN - Meijer Inc. is confirming the acquisition of 30 acres in an Minneapolis suburb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Michigan big-box retailer doesn&amp;#39;t have any immediate plans for the property or entering the Minnesota market, said Frank Guglielgmi, Meijer&amp;#39;s senior director of communications. Meijer just launched its $750 million expansion into neighboring Wisconsin that will put 16 supercenter stores in the state by 2019.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordmans to open five stores in 2016&lt;/strong&gt;\nMARCH 18, 2016,  Gordmans Stores plans to open a new store next month in its hometown of Omaha in April, the first of five new units the apparel and home décor retailer has planned for the year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gordmans launched its e-commerce site last year and opened six new stores to end the year with 102 locations while turning in a weak sales and profit performance. The addition of selling space enabled the company to increase sales 0.9% to $205.7 million while same-store sales decreased 2.2% during the fourth quarter ended Jan. 30. Net income for period fell to $1.1 million, six cents a share, from $2.3 million, or 12 cents a share, the prior year. Gordmans ended 2015 with total sales of $649 million, an increase of 2.3% from the prior year, while same-store sales declined 1.2%. The company reported a loss of $4.3 million, or 22 cents a share, compared to a prior year loss of $3.5 million, or 18 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discount Stores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fred&amp;#39;s announces new chairman alongside Q4, 2015 results\nMARCH 23, 2016,  Fred’s on Wednesday reported its Q4 and FY2015 earnings, as well as the news that board chairman Michael Hayes would be stepping down, to be replaced with longtime director Thomas Tashjian.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The company’s quarterly earnings hit $554.5 million a 10% increase over the same period last year. This increase grows to 14% when sales from stores that largely closed in Q4 2014 are discounted. Comparable store sales grew by 1.7%, and net loss for the quarter was $3.9 million, compared to an $8.2 million loss in the same period last year — a difference Fred’s attributed to the cost of store closures and provisions for inventory reserves. Gross profit for the quarter increased 7% to $132.9 million, and its adjusted diluted earnings per share — $0.02 — reflected a 250% increase over Q4 2014. Gross margin dropped from 27% in Q4 2014 to 25% this year, which the company attributes to growth among specialty pharmacy, which is a low-margin category.  From a full-year perspective, Fred’s $2.15 billion total sales reflected a 9% increase over the entirety of FY2014, a number that grows to 13% over last year when excluding $71.7 million in sales from stores that were closed in 2015. Comps increased 1.5% for the full year — compared to a loss of 0.6% in FY2014 — and gross profit grew to $551.6 million, an increase of 3% over last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five Below ramping up store growth&lt;/strong&gt;\nMARCH 23, 2016 ,  Five Below is accelerating new store growth again this year.  The tween and teen retailer shared a long-range profit forecast which indicates it expects accelerating growth to be a recurring theme. It plans to open 85 new stores this year, adding to its base of 437 units.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A net increase of 71 new stores last year – on top of 62 units the prior year – enabled Five Below to increase sales 23.7% to $326.4 million in the fourth quarter and 22.3% to $832 million during the fiscal year ended Jan. 30. Also contributing to the top line growth was a fourth quarter same store sales increase of 3.6% and a full year increase of 3.4%.  Profits increased 26.1% to $42 million, or 77 cents a share, compared to $33.3 million, or 61 cents a share, during the fourth quarter the prior year. Full year profits increased 20.1% to $57.7 million, or $1.05 a share, compared to $48 million, or 88 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kohl’s Reveals Store Closure List&lt;/strong&gt;\nMarch 21, 2016,  After a disappointing fourth quarter that saw profits drop 20 percent, the 1,164 store-Kohl’s Corporation has released the names of 18 underperforming stores that will close this year. Half will be in California, including seven concentrated in southern California. The remainder are in Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All will close by June 19, with the exception of one store in Georgia slated to close on November 1.  The Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based retail chain announced plans to shutter 18 underperforming stores on February 25, when it released disappointing financials for the quarter ending January 30—a period that included the normally robust holiday shopping season. At the same time, the retailer confirmed its plans to open seven, smaller-format stores in 2016, as well as a dozen Fila outlets, and two Off/Aisle stores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grocery Stores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publix making first push into Greater Washington&lt;/strong&gt;\nMar 23, 2016, Publix, a Florida-based grocer with a cult-like following in the south, has hired a local broker and appears to ready to enter the D.C. market. The company had a booth at the International Council of Shopping Centers’ Mid-Atlantic Dealmaking and Conference event last week at National Harbor. It was the first time Publix has had a presence at the event, which connects landlords with potential retailers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Publix spokeswoman Kim Reynolds confirmed the chain is looking to open stores throughout Virginia, including in Northern Virginia, although she said could not speak to the District or other parts of the Washington region specifically. The company&amp;#39;s presence at the expo created quite a buzz, with attendees saying its booth was mobbed for much of the day. Publix held several meetings with brokers and other conference goers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Martin&amp;#39;s&lt;/strong&gt; reportedly selling its 19 stores in the Richmond area as part of merger\nMarch 21, 2016,  The 19 Martin’s Food Markets stores in the Richmond region likely will be sold or closed this year as part of a planned merger, according to an industry trade publication.  The Kroger and/or Publix supermarket chains could be the likely buyer of those stores.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sale of the Martin’s stores would be needed to satisfy federal regulators so Dutch retail conglomerate Royal Ahold NV — which operates U.S. supermarket chains Martin’s, Giant and Stop &amp;amp; Shop — can combine this year with its Belgian counterpart Delhaize Group, which owns Food Lion and Hannaford stores. Shareholders of both companies approved the deal last week.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;83 Ahold-Delhaize stores for sale: Report&lt;/strong&gt;\nMar 21, 2016,  An industry trade paper on Monday published a list of 83 stores that it reported Ahold and Delhaize are seeking to sell as part of their forthcoming merger, including all 20 Martin&amp;#39;s stores in the Richmond area. Ahold and Delhaize officials have not commented on the report, but have acknowledged stores would likely be divested so as to receive antitrust approval for their deal to close. The FTC had not commented as of late Monday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As part of any merger approval process where there may be store divestitures, store visits may be conducted by potential buyers but it&amp;#39;s too early to speculate on the outcome of the FTC review process,&amp;quot; Christopher Brand, an Ahold spokesman, told SN Monday. Christy Phillips-Brown, a spokeswoman for Delhaize&amp;#39;s Food Lion chain, in a statement said &amp;quot;Delhaize does not comment on pending regulatory matters or on market speculation.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Union: 8 Giant stores to be sold in merger&lt;/strong&gt;\nMar 21, 2016,  A trade union representing workers at Giant-Landover stores in the metro Washington area have informed members that eight stores where its members work could be sold in order to meet antitrust approval of the Ahold-Delhaize deal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Ahold-owned stores, which compete with nearby Food Lion locations operated by Delhaize, are located in Accokeek and La Plata, Md.; and in Stafford (two locations), Fredericksburg (two locations), Spotsylvania and Falmouth, Va., according to United Food and Commercial Workers Local 400.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home Improvement &amp;amp; Office Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staples and Office Depot take another shot at FTC&lt;/strong&gt;\nMARCH 18, 2016,  The CEOs of Staples and Office Depot penned a letter to customers which reveals the extent of their deteriorated relations with the Federal Trade Commission ahead of a hearing that begins March 21 that will determine whether the retailers are allowed to merge.  In the letter, Staples chairman and CEO Ron Sargent and Office Depot chairman and CEO Roland Smith stop short of actually calling the FTC stupid, but that is the inference from more diplomatically worded prose.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The FTC’s actions to stop this transaction are based on a flawed analysis of the marketplace and a deep misunderstanding of the competitive landscape,” Sargent and Smith state in the letter. “The FTC has cherry picked a few facts to fit its narrative and support its case. In making its case, the FTC refuses to even acknowledge the rise of new competitors, such as Amazon, and the disruptive effects of the digital economy.”  “The FTC continues to act against the best interests of the hundreds of thousands of business customers, and millions of everyday consumers who will benefit from the acquisition,” according to the letter. “The FTC is simply wrong. The combination of Staples and Office Depot is good for customers.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The acquisition has been approved in Australia, New Zealand, China and the European Union, subject to a divesture. To try to meet the FTC’s requirements, Staples recently entered into an agreement with Essendant to divest more than $550 million of wholesale business subject to the successful completion of the merger.\nRestaurant&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hospitality turnover rose to 72.1% in 2015&lt;/strong&gt;\nMar 23, 2016,  Official numbers are beginning to emerge that confirm what restaurant operators already knew: Turnover rates have been pushing higher.  The turnover rate in the economy’s hospitality segment in 2015 rose to 72.1 percent, up from 66.7 percent in 2014, according to a recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report. It was the fifth consecutive year of turnover rate increases.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bruce Grindy, chief economist for the National Restaurant Association, posted this week that turnover rates remained below the pre-recession high of 80.7 percent in 2007, but the 2015 rate was more than 15 percentage points higher than the 56.4 percent logged in 2010. The bureau does not report data solely for restaurants but uses a broader “accommodations and foodservices” sector. The average turnover rate for all private-sector workers stood at 45.9 percent in 2015. Grindy noted that remained lower than the average turnover rate of 50 percent during the 2002–2006 period.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Krispy Kreme looks to expand franchising&lt;/strong&gt;\nMar 23, 2016,  Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. believes it would be better off if someone else built and operated its shops.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Winston Salem, N.C.-based doughnut chain plans to focus more exclusively on franchising in the coming years, executives said during the company’s earnings call Tuesday. Their reason is simple: Franchisees have been doing a better job than the company at operating the chain’s locations.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Krispy Kreme profit rises 26% on sales growth\nMar 22, 2016,  Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. said Tuesday that its net income rose 26 percent in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, as the chain’s same-store sales continued to grow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Systemwide same-store sales rose 1.6 percent in the quarter and 3.9 percent for the year. Company same-store sales rose 2.4 percent for the year, the seventh straight year of growth. The chain&amp;#39;s same-store sales didn&amp;#39;t meet Wall Street expectations, and the stock was down 6 percent after hours. Net income was $8.2 million in the fourth quarter, or 13 cents per share, rising from $6.5 million, or 10 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. Adjusted earnings rose 14 percent, to 22 cents per share, from 17 cents per share. For the year, revenues increased 5.8 percent, to $518.7 million, from $490.3 million. The company expects to open 30 new domestic units, along with 120 to 140 international locations. It also expects flat commodity costs offset by higher labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restaurant analysts cautiously optimistic on Texas&lt;/strong&gt;\nMar 22, 2016,  Declining oil prices are muffling restaurant sales gains in some Texas markets, but equity analysts are cautiously optimistic on economic trends in the Lone Star State. Analyst reports from Baird Equity Research and Maxim Group noted strengths in the state’s economy despite downward pressures in the oil sector, which led some public restaurant companies to start expressing concerns last fall.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The National Restaurant Association 2016 Forecast, released in February, projected a 3.8-percent increase in sales in Texas, reaching $52.4 billion this year, rising from $50.4 billion in 2015. Texas ranked second in total restaurant sales behind California, which is expected to reach $79.1 billion in 2016. The NRA forecast the total national rate of increase in restaurant industry sales would be 5 percent in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red Robin&lt;/strong&gt; acquires 13 franchised units\nMar 21, 2016,  Red Robin Gourmet Burgers Inc. has acquired 13 of its franchised restaurants in Texas with plans to expand further into that market, the company said Monday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the company has completed the purchase of seven Red Robin units in Houston; two in Dallas; and one restaurant respectively in Lubbock, Austin, Abilene and Amarillo. The sellers included Cowboy Red LC; Cowgirl Red LLC; Texas Red Real Estate Ltd and affiliates; Robert Reynolds and Carolyn Frost Keenan.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blaze Pizza&lt;/strong&gt; triples sales in 2015\nMar 18, 2016,  Blaze Fast-Fire’d Pizza reported same-store sales growth of 7 percent for fiscal 2015, the company said Friday. The Pasadena, Calif.-based chain also tripled its sales for the Dec. 27-ended year to $101 million, compared with $33 million in fiscal 2014, with both numbers including sales by franchised units as reported to the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blaze ended fiscal 2015 with 105 units, more than double the 50 units open at the end of 2014. Currently the chain has 116 locations open and Blaze expects to open another 96 units over the next 12 months, including expansion into 10 new states and markets in Boston, Denver, Salt Lake City, Phoenix and Atlanta.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dollar Stores, Warehouse Club &amp;amp; Other Retailers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GameStop&lt;/strong&gt; emerges victorious from transitional 2015\nMARCH 25, 2016,  GameStop&amp;#39;s efforts to generate growth by diversifying its business model worked well in 2015, as the video game retailer posted its third straight year of positive comps.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Texas-based company said that for the full fiscal year of 2015 ended on Jan. 30, total sales were $9.36 billion, a 0.7% increase over 2014. Same-store sales increased 4.3% (a 4.8% increase in the U.S. and a 3% increase internationally) compared to fiscal 2014, primarily driven by sales of video game accessories, pre-owned products and collectibles. GameStop&amp;#39;s fiscal 2015 net earnings were $402.8 million. For the fourth quarter, profit at GameStop was $247.8 million, or $2.36 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $244.1 million, or $2.23 a share. Revenue rose 1.4% to $3.52 billion. Same-store sales grew 3.1%.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dollar General&lt;/strong&gt; to open 1,000 stores in 2017\nMARCH 24, 2016,  Dollar General will break its own record for store expansion in 2017. And that’s saying a lot. The discounter is already in high gear, with plans to open a record 900 stores and remodel or relocate about 875 existing locations in 2016. But it’s upping the total for 2017, forecasting some 1,000 new stores and 900 remodels or relocations, which is in line with its model of 6% to 8% square footage growth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Dollar General opened 730 new stores and remodeled or relocated 881 stores which combined with a 2.8% same-store sales increase allowed it to grow total sales 7.7% to $20.4 billion. The company ended its fiscal year on Jan. 29, with 12,483 stores. Dollar General revealed its plans for 2017 late Wednesday, on the eve of the company’s March 24 investor conference. In addition to the heightened level of new store growth and remodeling activity, ahead of the meeting the company shared an update on other key initiatives and performance assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sportsman’s Warehouse&lt;/strong&gt; hunts for growth with more new stores\nMARCH 24, 2016, Sportsman’s Warehouse Holdings announced plans for its most ambitious expansion program ever with 11 new stores planned for 2016 following a strong fourth quarter performance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Midvale, Utah-based operator of 64 stores focused on the categories of hunting, fishing and camping, opened nine stores last year which combined with its strong fourth quarter showing enabled the company to produce record results. The addition of 11 stores this year will give the company, which went public in April 2014, 75 locations in 20 predominantly Western states and Alaska. Fourth quarter net income, adjusted to exclude non-recurring litigation and loan refinancing costs, increased 25.3% to $11.4 million, or 27 cents a share, from $9.1 million, or 22 cents a share, in the fourth quarter the prior year. Full year adjusted net income, which also excludes expenses related to a secondary stock offering in the third quarter of 2015, increased 22.3% to $25.8 million, or 61 cents a share, from $21.1 million, or 50 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Signet shines in Q4, ramps up store expansion\nMARCH 24, 2016, Signet Jewelers is already the world’s largest retailer of diamond jewelry and it plans to get even bigger in 2016 by accelerating new store and omnichannel growth. The news came as the chain reported a same-store sales increase of 4.9% in the fourth quarter.\nOperating stores under banners such as Kay, Jared and Zale, Signet expects to increase square footage by 3% to 3.5% in 2016, compared to an earlier forecast of 2% to 3% growth. That translates to new store opening in the range of 145 to 178 units for a net increase minus closures of between 61 and 87 units on store based of 3,625 unit at the end of its fiscal year on Jan. 30.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sporting goods retailer in two big city openings\nMARCH 21, 2016,  &lt;strong&gt;Modell’s Sporting Goods&lt;/strong&gt; continues to grow its brick-and-mortar footprint. The New York-based company has added two more stores to its portfolio, one in Boston and the other in Philadelphia. Both stores are in prime locations formerly occupied by City Sports. (City Sports filed for bankruptcy in October 2016, and subsequently announced it would close all locations.)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In Boston, Modell’s opened an 11,000-sq.-ft. store on Boylston Street, in the city’s Back Bay area. It’s the retailer’s first outpost in downtown Boston.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "*Awakening myself groggily from my sleep, I begin immediately by following the local TV news. Fortunately, it seems the church are tending to their job nicely, with every supernatural incident occurring the night before explained in mundane means.*\n\n*Due to the level of the destruction last night, both Lancer and Archer decided on their own to flee from the fight with Rider before things got messy. It was likely for the best, though it was a shame we couldn't force Rider to show more of a hand.*\n\n*That woman was...mysterious, to say the least. With a blindfold, long violet hair and using a chain-dagger as a weapon, it should be a simple matter to identify her as a heroic spirit, however that was simply not the case. Other than her ability to perceive her surroundings without a sense of sight and her intense speed, there was nothing truly outstanding about her strength on appearance. And yet I get the feeling Lancer was being more wary than necessary around her.*\n\n\"Lancer, do you happen to know that servant from last night?\"\n\n*Lancer materializes to my side as soon as I speak. It's reassuring to see his presence after feeling like I've left myself vulnerable for several hours, however his troubled expression seems to reflect my own thoughts.*\n\n\"Nah, I didn't. I'm a little confused about her myself. Speaking logically...there's nothin' about her skills which she displayed during our fight which should have me worried, but my gut feelin' tells me she's not to be messed with.\"\n\n*I personally couldn't feel as much as that, but it certainly was strange how much both Lancer and I were driven to let Rider play her own cards, instead of forcing her to show them. We should keep that in mind when planning our action for today. With that said, I take out a piece of paper by my bedside in the room and start writing out ideas.*\n\n\"Hey, pal, aren'cha forgetting 'bout Archer's identity?\"\n\n*Lancer interrupts me as I begin to get most of the information attained from last night down. It's not like I hadn't forgotten, but rather I hadn't deemed it important. I predict Cat will maintain our truce for a long time, and Archer's identity is inconsequential so long as we know the affects of his Noble Phantasm.*\n\n\"He's one of the emperors of Assyria during its short reign during 2000BC or so. I don't see any reason to care beyond that, considering he got more cornered than we did against Caster and we've seen his Noble Phantasm in action. Though the curse is powerful, it won't be able to stop your spear throw in a clash, rendering it obsolete. Besides,\", *I start, turning to him.*, \"We shouldn't worry about details which aren't relevant at the moment. Unless you doubt the sincerity of Archer's master, we can worry about facing him later.\"\n\n*Lancer nods his head in assent of my assessment, but still doesn't seem convinced in the way I'm evaluating threats. He's right in that regard. Despite how I went with him after the death of Caster, I can't help but oppose the nature which the rule dictates - Every servant is an enemy in the way to the grail, and Masters' lives are forfeit if need be. Even with that knowledge, I'm too weak to prepare myself to kill my current ally or even her servant. I can only hope it won't cost me anything significant.*\n\n*After half an hour, I'd written down all the relevant information, along with help from Lancer, and had prepared the action plan for today. During the daytime, we would find and acquire a car for transport, then purchase citizen clothes for Lancer before heading to a bar to drink and relax for a few hours.*\n\n*...I'm certain this would never be in my plans were it not for Lancer's presence. It seems his layabout attitude rubs off on me, and, seeing as he's currently flicking through the channels on the TV without a care in the world, it's not going to cease anytime soon. I suppose I owe it to him, after all.*\n\n*Lancer and I head out to the nearest car dealership, aiming to take out a commercial sports car on a monthly payment using false details, with basic hypnotism to make the process smooth.*\n\n*Having obtained our new transport, the streets somehow manage to be even more depressing than they were yesterday. In the past 20 years this city has been on the receiving end of three Holy Grail Wars, and the toll is clearly shown on the populace, even if unaware of its true nature.*\n\n*Such is the nature of how Magi do about their business...at the cost of everything deemed irrelevant. I must end this war as soon as possible, so that I may be able to at least repay the suffering brought upon some of the city.*\n\n*Thinking that, however, gives me an idea...*\n\n\"Lancer, I think I should suggest that the Grail War be relocated to another country after this one. It's clear that the aftermath is too taxing on one location of it runs on for too long in the same place.\"\n\n*Lancer answers almost immediately as we're walking. It seems his train of thought was similar to mine.*\n\n\"Yeah, I've had enough of seeing this sort of scene for one lifetime...just hits a little *too* close to home.\"\n\n*I can't fathom how Lancer is feeling right now, but if anything that our talk yesterday is enough to indicate, it's intense enough.*\n\n*Locking up our newly-obtained transport and having Lancer dematerialize, we immediately begin moving to the nearest clothes store for men. I browse the various goods, with Lancer picking out his selection from behind me, before finally moving to the counter and purchasing them.*\n\n*...a few pairs of slacks, some 3/4 length trousers and a Hawaiian shirt for almost every colour imaginable. I can't say I expected any less, but even the cheap straw hat to \"complete th'image\" was pushing it. The extent I'll go for this old man...*\n\n\"Y'know, you really don't have to do all this.\"\n\n*While having him change in one of the rooms provided by the store, Lancer interrupts the silence out of nowhere. Considering the attitude he's taken so far toward our partnership, this statement surprises me.*\n\n\"The names of the roles of servant and master aren't for show, and with the command seals you have packin', there's no real worry 'bout me going turncoat...\"\n\n*Now I see. For Lancer, being friends has only ever meant camaraderie to him. Whether as the son of a King, a politician or a soldier, he never truly established what could be seen as typical perspective on human relationships. I suppose that makes it my job to show him the way, despite not being an expert on it myself. But first...*\n\n\"This is simply what friends do for one-another, Lancer. You've covered my back more than enough times, so this is simply repaying the favour. Unless you weren't aware of that?\"\n\n*Judging by the strangled grunt and sudden sound of hangers falling, I believe my teasing was successful.*\n\n\"C-'course I knew that, waddya take this old man for?\"\n\n*Before I can give a retort, the man in question emerges from the booth in his chosen getup, with straw hat conveniently shading his face from view. He wouldn't look out of place in some sort of country-themed pop group, to be honest.*\n\n\"Well then, if the old man's fine with his wisdom being validated, let's head out.\"\n\n*I say to him, a small giggle building up my throat. It isn't too bad to get the better of him once in a while, though I get the feeling he'll pay me back eventually. He's got more than enough way with words, after all.*\n\n*Leaving the clothes store, I decide we shouldn't linger too long in drinking before getting to action. Getting back into the car, Lancer now materialized and inconspicuous, we drive to the center of Fuyuki and order a few drinks as the first bar we find.*\n\n*Eventually, we come across a small-sized bar with a wooden signpost which catches our fancy - the 'Copenhagen'. Once we enter we find ourselves urged by a middle-aged woman to find a seat. Seems hospitable enough.*\n\n*Seating ourselves, I take a look at the drinks menu laid out on the relatively small table Lancer and I are seated at. I don't exactly frequent bars and other such establishments, but guessing by the wide variety of categories and the exotic names of the drinks on offer, this is a fairly well-maintained bar.*\n\n*Taking a look at my drinking partner, I see he has a slightly perplexed look on his face. Does the grail's knowledge provided to servants not cover modern drinks?*\n\n\"Having issue deciding, Lancer?\", *I ask, a little concerned for the man who wanted to do something like this in the first place.*\n\n\"Nah, it's not that, it's just...squid ink and agave syrup? People drink that?\"\n\n*Somehow I get the feeling he's judging me alongside the rest of mankind with that question. I'll admit even I have to question that kind of cocktail, but people don't sell it if nobody wants it.*\n\n\"Why don't you just try it? It can't hurt for something exotic during an opportunity like this.\"\n\n*Seeming swayed by my words, we place our order of a '[Squid Ink Sour](http://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/food/restaurant-bar-reviews/weirdest-craziest-cocktails-where-to-drink-them/london-cocktail-club-squid-ink-sour)' cocktail for Lancer, while I simply order a pint of Irish Cider which I had during the Christmas party in Clocktower leading to the war.*\n\n\"Ah, so I see now. Yer 'ol buddy has to stick with the wacky drink while you're dandy with some plain old cider, huh?\"\n\n*Lancer is trying to look pissed, but he's got a smile creeping on his face. With the pressure of the war hanging on our shoulders, it's good to spend time messing around like this while we can. Even if it's the taboo of drinking out during the day.*\n\n*After spending little over an hour having two or three light drinks and having casual talk, we eventually decide to make our way out. There are still some happenings across Fuyuki which we haven't looked into even now, and could provide some clues as to the location of other masters or the identity of servants.*\n\n*I pay the moderate bill and thank the waiting staff, before heading outside and walking to our car.*\n\n\"Lancer, do you happen to remember where the plane crush and sequentially, the location of Saber's Noble Phantasm occurred?\", *I ask, as shamefully the details of that feel distant to me.*\n\n\"Yeah, sure, I'll drive on to it. Gotta admit, these steel carriages of your time have some kick to 'em!\" \n\n*Lancer remarks, as he completely disregards reasonable speeding laws in the outer roads of Fuyuki. I don't think it's that bad though, since he's kept to everything else...we're such middle-aged men, aren't we?*\n\n*We soon arrive at the crash site to see most of the rubble and debris already cleared. The landscape is destroyed where it crashed and a few police officers are still investigating the scene.*\n\n*I can't say I wasn't expecting this, it has been a while, after all. I guess I just wanted to write this off on my list for completion's sake. Concentrating a little, there's not even any trace of prana to be found in the air.*\n\n\"Looks like there's nothing for us here, unless you feel particularly obliged to interrogate the police.\", *I half-heartedly remark to Lancer, who now stands at my side with straw hat hung on his back like something I recall seeing on the TV.*\n\n\"Yeah, maybe we should just try the good 'ol 'returning to the scene of the crime' method if we wanna get somewhere.\"\n\n*Back to the place we fought last night then...it's likely we'll run into some other masters there, not that it's a bad thing. If we can't get anywhere with investigation today, it might be better to observe others tomorrow night, instead of putting ourselves on the line. Rider's true capabilities are still unknown, and the fact Berserker forced a Saber as famous as Sir Gawain of the round table to use his Noble Phantasm doesn't bode well.*\n\n*Giving a short not in approval, we head back into the car and drive to a parking space nearest to the destroyed car park from last night, before walking to it. The scene before us is similar to the plane crash; lots of debris and a few cops investigating. They look really high strung and are looking for suspicious individuals.*\n\n*With the number of police investigating, it's not wise to hang around, however I do want to try and at least spot some other masters investigating...*\n\n*I locate a nearby cafe alongside Lancer in order to observe the location for a while, and not long after he informs me that he feels the presence of the servant who fought Saber at the crash site on the first night.*\n\n*Likely to be Berserker then...why is his master taking him out during the daytime? This is bad.*\n\n\"Lancer, we're going to the crash site - We can't trust Berserker's master to not try something that may harm civilians or the police investigating.\"\n\n*I say, while quickly exiting the cafe through its door and walking onto the gloomy streets. Lancer, still materialized and in his choice clothing, follows behind me with a grim expression on his face before sighing.*\n\n\"Why's it always gotta be this pattern of endangering the townspeople followed by regular fights in th' grail war? Really begins to wear you down, y'know?\"\n\n*I doubt he's expecting an answer from me, but I share his sentiments. In the past two days we've had far too many catastrophic accidents to my liking. It makes me feel like I'm the only reasonable master in this war, though I know that can't be the case.*\n\n*Berserker is easily found digging through the rubble in the wreck of the car park. He seems disinterested in us, but the powerful bloodlust of the Berserker class is permeating from him, nonetheless.*\n\n*Is he trying to find something...or someone buried in the rubble? Right now he seems to pose no threat, and starting a fight will simply escalate the situation.*\n\n\"We'll keep observing him for now. If you think he's up to something dangerous then feel free to attack him immediately.\"\n\n*Lancer, now in his battle raiment with spear in hand, has a tenseness which emanates from his body. Berserker is the most unpredictable and awkward of all the servant classes, yet everyone has to respect its power.*\n\n*As Berserker turns, his glowing red visor boring into us, I give berserker a little mocking wave, followed up by the 'I'm watching you' gesture.*\n\n*Lancer can't help but give a small snicker in response, but this is mostly an act. Coming into the war, Berserker was the servant class I was most wary of, due to its unpredictable nature and overbearing strength. However, preventing further damage to the town is more important than my own fears. Lancer's grip on his spear tightens slightly, betraying his carefree demeanour.*\n\n*Berserker soon returns to his digging, before eventually finding a lamppost and running off with it, not looking like he is seeking combat.*\n\n*Seeing Berserker flee suspiciously, I'm half tempted to chase after him. However, I still don't truly trust any master that I don't know personally, and having a servant appear in broad daylight to collect a piece of rubble either speaks for his master's eccentricity...or the servant can use such an object in an effective manner.*\n\n*Weighing the options in my head, I decide it's best to follow Berserker for a short while, making sure he isn't doing anything untoward during daytime before leaving him. Lancer begins following Berserker at a distance, not showing a threatening presence but equally making himself known.*\n\n*Berserker turns behind him and makes an inarticulate gargle, and Lancer could swear he just got flipped off.*\n\n\"Man, this guy's one hell of a cheeky bastard.\", *Lancer remarks, ensuring Berserker's in earshot, before turning back on the mad servant.*\n\n*Against my own expectations, it seems neither Berserker nor his master are up to anything untoward...though such a reckless action doesn't seem to worth obtaining...a lamppost? I'm still wary of the servant, but it seems that at the least his master has him under control, which will change my priorities a little.*\n\n*Moving to our next course of action, I decide to regroup with Lancer and have him drive us to the docks. It seems to be a hotspot in running into servants of late, and I'm hoping I can gain information on any fights which may have happened while we were absent.*\n\n*Arriving at the docks, Lancer soon feels the presence of another servant, this time our combatant from last night.*\n\n*So Rider it is...I'm not sure she'll be willing to fight during daytime, but of all the servants I've fought or seen fighting extensively so far, she's the only one which is a mystery. Perhaps we can glean some information from her or her master.*\n\n\"Let's head toward her, you can materialize in your casuals for this, might help the image of peace.\", *I tell Lancer, to which he grins heartily.*\n\n*I can't help but enjoy today so far. It's one thing to learn and know a person through constant battles for your life, but another to simply enjoy yourselves with one-another. Ever since coming to Clocktower, the closest things I've had to friends has been both him and Catia, the latter of which forgot what I looked like within a few months. Though it's a bitter reminder of what I sacrificed by leaving Atlas to pursue a speciality derived from my craft, it makes it all the more refreshing in the time I have now. I might even be able to fight tonight with a smile on my face, though that's probably the alcohol talking.*\n\n*Seeing the non-threatening attitude, it seems Rider is approaching on our location, but is soon drowned out by a very familiar aura - that of our favourite black-and-red mad knight.*\n\n*Even I can feel the more...vicious presence of Berserker this time. This may be bad, but multiple servants getting into a fight increases the odds of being able to team up and take down one.*\n\n*I begin to speak to Lancer, but he seems to have picked up on the situation quicker than I have, and is now dressed in his military garb with Durindana's tip leaning against the ground menacingly.*\n\n\"Sheesh, we haven't exactly been getting anywhere today and now I get that kinda feeling that we're being jerked around a little...\"\n\n*Lancer remarks, keeping his eyes peeled on his surroundings for both Rider and Berserker. A fight is becoming more and more likely, and being tired so early in the day will make bad tidings for what happens tonight.*\n\n*I bring out half of Pure Orichalcum's mass and form it into a function shield, holding it in my right hand while leaving Lancer to guard my left. With two Servants in the vacinity and no idea of their true capabilities and grievances, I'm not taking any chances.*\n\n*With Rider nowhere to be seen, Berserker makes a mad lunge toward Lancer with his previously-witnessed street pole.*\n\n*Lancer quickly responds by cutting through the inferior material of the opposing weapon, but even faster than he can react, Berserker twirls the remains of his weapon and knocks Lancer's spear upward, before grabbing it with his free hand.*\n\n*My own servant attempts to distance his weapon from the grasping hand, before kicking Berserker in the chest, but finds the mad knight pouncing on him and forcing him to the ground.*\n\n*Shit, this is bad, Lancer can't beat Berserker in a battle of raw strength, and I'm certain this is the exact situation Berserker want to be in.*\n\n***Lancer, by power of this command seal, I order you, throw Berserker off of you!***\n\n*Through the power of your Command Seal, Lancer successfully pushes Berserker off of him and through a wall of a warehouse building. Moment's later, six precise water pipes come piercing through the wall in a rapid succession, moving as fast as a bullet and aiming straight for me.*\n\n*Simultaneously, Berserker comes crashing through the same wall while mounted atop an enhanced forklift.*\n\n*Taking immediate action, I shift my body to dodge most of the pipes while blocking the remainder with my formed shield. Taking in the impact, I'm tossed back several meters and off my feet, showing the clear power behind the throw.*\n\n*Upon getting a new view of the situation, I find Berserker once again attacking Lancer using one of the 'forks' from the vehicle, while the industrial transport itself is driving straight toward me at max speed-*\n\n*Lancer, feeling the clear difference in strength, tries to keep as much distance from Berserker as possible while keeping him at bay with safe, non-committal jabs with his spear.*\n\n*Meanwhile, I take out the remaining mass of Pure Orichalcum and form it into a sturdy ramp over my head, spanning the size of the forklift's wheelspan, with the intention of redirecting the vehicle and launching it over my head.*\n\n*No words can or need to be said to Lancer. This is a do or die situation in which both of us must use our utmost capabilities to emerge with our lives. I can't reflect on it in this moment, but the first few seconds of this encounter reinforced this sole fact:*\n\n*Berserker is a foe Lancer and I cannot defeat.*\n\n*The forklift safely soars over my head, riding off the makeshift ramp, while Lancer's opponent makes a mad grab for his head. Lancer tries to back further off and make a cut at Berserker's arms in response, hoping to buy more time.*\n\n*I suddenly spot Rider moving in to intervene with the fight, shouting:*\n\n*\"Only animals interrupt the conversations of others!\"*\n\n*If I weren't currently fighting for my life, I'd call Rider out on how lame that line was. Right now, Lancer needs all the help he can get. In spite of that, I can't do anything...if the nature of Berserker's noble phantasm is that anything he touches becomes it, even my own Mystic Code will simply be giving him an advantage.*\n\n*All I can do now is trust in Lancer to pull through.*\n\n*\"I hope you have a plan lancer otherwise it's just honest fighting again.\" Rider calls to lancer.* \n\n*The two are now caught up in a deadly dance with the mad servant, each using their long-reach weapons to hold him at bay while creating opportunities to lands hits in.*\n\n\"Yeaaaah well, to be honest, this guy likes to get a little *too* close for comfort when it comes to these sort of things. Even a-\", *Lancer stops his banter for a short moment to dodge an attempt at his neck by Berserker, before continuing,* \"Even a fun-loving guy like me has limits to personal space, and he's crossed all of 'em. Several times.\"\n\n*Even being Lancer's master myself, I can't help but marvel at Lancer's ability to act cool even during a situation like this. However, I can't let my guard down. I spy a man walking toward me at a leisurely pace in the midst of the combat, I can't help but be wary.*\n\n\"State your identity and business!\", *I shout, one eye on them while the other desperately trying to follow the conflict between the three legendary heroes.*\n\n*I watch as Rider gets kicked across the entire length of the docks by Berserker.*\n\n*Rider emerged from the rubble which she was knocked into. \"Hmm so no plan at all. Perfect.\", she comments, before jumping back into the fray launching mid range attacks at Berserker's back to try lessen his pressure on Lancer. \"I doubt this is a servant normal fighting can beat. I do recall him losing an arm a few days ago, look at him now.\"*\n\n*Shortly after, Berserker begins to ignore Rider's attacks and charges Lancer with a powerful swing, weapon in hand.*\n \n*The approaching man stopped and held up both hands up. \"Woow, I'm unarmed.\", he says with a level of disbelief.*\n\n*\"Hmm names right? I am Revolutionary Lye but you would know me as master of Rider. I believe you came to talk before that black monster attacked though I must ask if you guys brought him here along the way?\" He speaks in a casual tone.*\n\n*\"That thing's master isn't here in any case.\"*\n\n\"If you're suspecting of this being a set-up, then I'm just as surprised to have him come out of nowhere as you are.\", *I say, retracting the spear I drew as a precautionary back into Pure Orichalcum's main mass, but keeping the shield on hand.*\n\n*I only threatened him as a precaution for if he actually happened to be Berserker's master or Assassin with some sort of disguise. As far as I care, Rider and her master are allies at the moment, and I can do with all the help I can get.*\n\n*I watch as the black beast manages to send Rider halfway across the docks, before already charging back toward Lancer, undeterred. There's no doubt that Berserker is one of, if not the strongest servant in the war.*\n\n\"Lancer's already established he can't be Berserker one on one, and his Noble Phantasm is useless against Berserker while he's in the state he's in. What I'm saying is if you don't want to servants to be killed by him, you're the one who needs to play the trump cards.\"\n\n*All the while, Lancer cuts the length of Berserker's makeshift weapon which he uses to attack the servant in half, leaving him essentially unarmed. Rider throws her chains and temporarily restricts his left arm.*\n\n*\"Master of Lancer, you still haven't told me why you came to talk before Berserker attacked. You ask much of me to play my trump cards while me and my servant can escape easily. I do not wish to abandon someone so quickly but I currently have little incentive to commit so much in this fight.\"*\n\n*Hmm, though I see his point, my reasoning is going to be rather flimsy in comparison.*\n\n\"In all honesty, I just was fishing for information. Give some sort of equivalent exchange, then we could both go off on our ways with better information concerning our foes in the war. If it came down to it, I'd offer a straight fight with your servant, considering last night was a little unsatisfactory for Lancer and I.\"\n\n*I say, giving him a sceptical look. I can only try to convey the disdain in my voice in levelling an entire car park in an attempt to harm his opponents, which would obviously be futile against a servant worth their salt.*\n\n\"Plus, to be entirely honest, my Lancer's an easier foe than Berserker. If we can team up to take out a heavyweight in the war now, then both of us won't have to fret over him in the future. With your full assistance, I can guarantee we will be capable of defeating him.\"\n\n*I have a little hesitation in my voice, I do not truly know the full capabilities of Rider, however I have to give a confident sales pitch now if I want any chance of killing Berserker today. This whole deal has done nothing but prove that servant is my top priority if I want any chance in winning the war with Lancer.*\n\n*He smiles a little at the response. \"You aren't the only one unsatisfied with last night's fight. True Berserker's actions do not sit well with me. I have a feeling its master has a pretty deep mana pool or is just insane. I guess a temporary truce is fine until Berserker is taken care of.\"*\n\n*He calls out to Rider. \"Rider you are allowed to use your noble phantasm against Berserker. I don't know what it does but try not to destroy our safe house. We don't want a large firework display calling everyone.\"*\n\n*Turning back to he asks- \"What is the name of the man I will work with for now? Also tell lancer to be careful I honestly don't know what rider is going to do, but what ever it is make sure Berserker doesn't escape from it.\" He begins to slowly back away from the area.*\n\n\n*Meanwhile, Berserker manages to grab one of Rider's chains and pulls him close to him with his immense strength. At the same time, Lancer successfully lands a clean slash across Berserker's fight shoulder.*\n\n*\"Lancer help me get some distance and get ready. Our masters have come to an agreement.\", Rider calls to Lancer, with a hint of urgency as she is overpowered by Berserker.*\n\n\"Lancer, you heard her. Occupy Berserker for as long as possible then haul your ass out of there once her Noble Phantasm has been unleashed.\"\n\n*I order Lancer through our mental connection, content with the cooperation of Rider's master. The next few moments will be key, but pleasantries can come first. Turning back to Rider's master, I greet him.*\n\n\"I'm Kishtar Andar Tahwil, an Alchemist from Atlas and by extension a magus from Clocktower. Pleased to meet your acquaintance, though I'd prefer it if you call me Kishtar.\"\n\n*I perhaps feel slightly uneasy about his ignorance of Rider's Noble Phantasm, however. Do they have some form of tension between them, or is he bluffing in order to trick me? I'm too far invested in this battle at the moment to consider the possibilities, but I can just weigh all my chances on the coming moments.*\n\n*\"Hmm nice to meet you Kishtar. The clocktower is no friend of mine though Atlas is fine I guess.\"*\n\n*Lancer helps free Rider by slicing the chain between her and Berserker.* \n\n\"I was hoping the chain didn't have to be destroyed. Anyway get back lancer!\", *Rider calls out.*\n\n*After making some distance from Berserker, Rider slices her throat and a sigil quickly forms from the blood spraying out her neck. I feel an intense surge of magical energy and have to cover my eyes to avoid being blinded by a white streak of light.*\n\n*Lancer sprints away from Berserker as fast as he can manage, responding to Rider's slightly grotesque means of preparing her Noble Phantasm.* \n\n\"Jeez, I never knew you were into that kinda play, Rider...\", *He can't help but comment jokingly as his vision begins to get blurred by the white light.*\n\n\"Lancer,\" *, I start, realizing I should warn him before the moment arrives,* \"Be prepared to secure Berserker's death with your Noble Phantasm if necessary. You should know when it's appropriate.\"\n\n*I catch a glimpse of a goatee'd nod before I can no longer see lancer through the daze of Rider's Noble Phantasm activating. For safety, I hold up my morphed shield and try to block out the glare of light.*\n\n*The blinding disappears as quickly as it came. Rider had not moved, and Berserker is nowhere to be seen. It seems as though he was saved by the power of a Command Seal.*\n\n*My eyes eventually recover from their temporary blindness, and spot my very short-lived ally still by my side.*\n\n*\"Hmmm how disappointing, another lukewarm end to a fight. It looks like Berserker's master is pretty tactical to use command seal right then, not a psycho then.\" I say to Kistar. \"What now? I guess we can have a proper talk now Berserker is gone or something.\" He calls out to Rider asking her to come to his side.*\n\n*Lancer moves to my side after his short retreat without being asked. I can't say that I wasn't expecting the command seal to be used, but I'm disappointed we couldn't kill Berserker or draw out something to compromise his identity. Lancer has a similar disappointed expression, but it seems to be more focused on Rider than anyone else...interesting.*\n\n\"Would you be willing to trade information? In the current stages of the war I have no interest in an alliance, though I wouldn't mind giving help in taking down the likes of Berserker or Saber should it come down to it.\"\n\n*I feel like it would be...some form of cheating to enter an open alliance or even truce with another master while I still have my current one with Cat, even if it could be advantageous. Speaking of Cat, I haven't seen her since Caster's death last night...her Servant seems competent, but I hope she's safe regardless.*\n\n*Something else also pops into mind-*\n\n\"How odd, I gave you my name but I don't remember ever asking for yours, Master of Rider.\"\n\n*Too many faces remain without names due to my inability to give common courtesy of late, a minor but irritating downfall of mine.*\n\n*Even so, Lancer seems unusually solemn for someone who keeps up a constant mask. Has this loss really gotten him that down or is it something to do with Rider? I swear, if it's him being lecherous I'll be the one to give him a clear scolding.*\n\n*\"I am a Child of the Phoenix, a dying group whose only wish is to save the world. I do not know what name my parents gave me but I was called Lye. when I swore to carry the will of the Phoenix I was given the title Revolutionary so I now am Revolutionary Lye.\"*\n\n*\"Yea an alliance is definitely impossible now but the actions of team Berserker intrigues me. It honestly makes me wants to burn them slowly so the souls are deeply cleansed though they definitely will be troublesome to defeat. I am up for working together but only to defeat Berserker.\"*\n\n*\"Honestly the only information I have worth giving are the circumstances of team Saber, Rider tell them.\"*\n\n*Rider nods and continues. \"The Master was on a commercial plane coming to participate in the war when everyone else on board was rendered unconscious probably by magic. Even Saber, someone who undoubtedly has an excellent riding skill was unable to control the disabled plane. After escaping the plane they were attacked by Berserker who forced the use of Excalibur Galatine from Saber. The attacked forced Berserker to escape after taking out his right arm.\"*\n\n*\"Thank you Rider, that's all I can offer for now, but it begs the question of whether Berserker's attack after the plane crash was a mere coincidence\", Lye finally concludes his supply of information.*\n\n*So in summary, a religious nutjob. Just what I need. A savior for the world can't be found in focus groups with eccentric madmen, it's found in single madmen with great focus in their speciality. There's a reason no heroic spirit can be summoned as more than one or two people. Groups never succeed as single legends.*\n\n\"That information regarding Saber of yours is pretty interesting. The best guess of mine would be that Caster was the one to attack the airline, but could not predict Saber's capabilities as a heroic spirit, and decided not to further her attack once Berserker engaged.\"\n\n*I take a short break in voicing my thoughts, when Lancer actually picks up where I left off. It seems he got out of his reverie, and is now wearing his regular dumbass grin and lax demeanour.*\n\n\"All that really ends up tellin' ya is that Caster and her master were here 'fore the war really got goin...not that it matters with the witch bein' dead n all. Guess we have to spill the beans 'bout our compadre, eh Kishtar?\"\n\n*Look at him, getting all fancy with his vocabulary. Were it not for the need to look good in front of Lye, I'd probably be wrestling him to the ground by now. Even now, the good spirit brought to me from this afternoon remains in my behaviour.*\n\n\"Yeah, the only real person I can give worthwhile information about is Archer's master.\", *I pause for a moment, considering how to approach. Cat is still my friend and ally, so I can't spill everything about her, especially not the identity of her servant...*\n\n\"She's a magus from a minor bloodline, and doesn't seem to be affiliated with Clocktower, in spite of studying there. She uses some branch of non-offensive wind magecraft, and she summoned Archer in the docks of the town on the first day. She doesn't seem particularly experienced in the war or fighting in general, but her servant seems skilled and versatile.\"\n\n*That's about as much as I can offer to the enemy master. Perhaps I'd be more willing to talk about other topics were he someone I feel I can get along with, but people with grand visions without reasonable means to reach it just strike me as deluded. Consider your ability to save one person or a hundred being thinking you can save the entire human race...not that I'd say that in person, reserved as I am.*\n\n*\"Yea that's right Caster is dead but her master still lives. She still could do something reckless as a final push for the war... I know I would.\"* \n\n*Rider cuts in to stop her Master's rambling, \"Don't worry Lancer I will protect my master at all cost, as much as I also want to finish our fight, my master's safety and wishes take priority. First thing being the defeat of Berserker, after that maybe we can finish things.\"*\n\n*The Master continues;*\n\n*\"O Rider you can say strange things, anyway Kishtar how would I contact you for anything related to team Berserker as temporary as this friendship is.\"*\n\n*A way of contact? I suppose I could be creative...*\n\nI form a small ball bearing out of Pure Orichalcum the size of a typical marble, and throw it to him, before adding:\n\n\"That piece of metal will be naturally obliged to rejoin with my Mystic Code. Keep it contained in a pocket or something else safe, then release it if you want to talk. We'll meet at the Copenhagen in downtown, it has some decent drinks from my own experience.\"\n\n\"If that's all you wish to talk about, I suppose we'll be heading off...though the fact you don't know the nature of your servant's Noble Phantasm is interesting, to say the least...\"\n\n*Lancer, seeing the intention of the rest of my sentence, decides to cut in for me.*\n\n\"I still wanna finish our fight from the other day, so keep yer master safe, alright Rider? You...nah, nevermind. It's not my business.\", *He seems to almost try to say something meaningful before trailing off into a whisper. I'm not even sure Lye could hear it, but Rider's excellent senses must have picked it up. Lancer certainly knows something about her.*\n\n*Lancer and I begin walking back to our car, while I check my watch to check the time. Our next course of action is still up in the air.*\n\n---\n\nAnd that's that. The conclusion of this perspective will be the next part in:\n\n**KISHTAR'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE PART 4: MYSTIC CODE IS UNBREAKABLE**",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Awakening myself groggily from my sleep, I begin immediately by following the local TV news. Fortunately, it seems the church are tending to their job nicely, with every supernatural incident occurring the night before explained in mundane means.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Due to the level of the destruction last night, both Lancer and Archer decided on their own to flee from the fight with Rider before things got messy. It was likely for the best, though it was a shame we couldn&amp;#39;t force Rider to show more of a hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That woman was...mysterious, to say the least. With a blindfold, long violet hair and using a chain-dagger as a weapon, it should be a simple matter to identify her as a heroic spirit, however that was simply not the case. Other than her ability to perceive her surroundings without a sense of sight and her intense speed, there was nothing truly outstanding about her strength on appearance. And yet I get the feeling Lancer was being more wary than necessary around her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lancer, do you happen to know that servant from last night?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer materializes to my side as soon as I speak. It&amp;#39;s reassuring to see his presence after feeling like I&amp;#39;ve left myself vulnerable for several hours, however his troubled expression seems to reflect my own thoughts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nah, I didn&amp;#39;t. I&amp;#39;m a little confused about her myself. Speaking logically...there&amp;#39;s nothin&amp;#39; about her skills which she displayed during our fight which should have me worried, but my gut feelin&amp;#39; tells me she&amp;#39;s not to be messed with.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I personally couldn&amp;#39;t feel as much as that, but it certainly was strange how much both Lancer and I were driven to let Rider play her own cards, instead of forcing her to show them. We should keep that in mind when planning our action for today. With that said, I take out a piece of paper by my bedside in the room and start writing out ideas.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey, pal, aren&amp;#39;cha forgetting &amp;#39;bout Archer&amp;#39;s identity?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer interrupts me as I begin to get most of the information attained from last night down. It&amp;#39;s not like I hadn&amp;#39;t forgotten, but rather I hadn&amp;#39;t deemed it important. I predict Cat will maintain our truce for a long time, and Archer&amp;#39;s identity is inconsequential so long as we know the affects of his Noble Phantasm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s one of the emperors of Assyria during its short reign during 2000BC or so. I don&amp;#39;t see any reason to care beyond that, considering he got more cornered than we did against Caster and we&amp;#39;ve seen his Noble Phantasm in action. Though the curse is powerful, it won&amp;#39;t be able to stop your spear throw in a clash, rendering it obsolete. Besides,&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;I start, turning to him.&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;quot;We shouldn&amp;#39;t worry about details which aren&amp;#39;t relevant at the moment. Unless you doubt the sincerity of Archer&amp;#39;s master, we can worry about facing him later.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer nods his head in assent of my assessment, but still doesn&amp;#39;t seem convinced in the way I&amp;#39;m evaluating threats. He&amp;#39;s right in that regard. Despite how I went with him after the death of Caster, I can&amp;#39;t help but oppose the nature which the rule dictates - Every servant is an enemy in the way to the grail, and Masters&amp;#39; lives are forfeit if need be. Even with that knowledge, I&amp;#39;m too weak to prepare myself to kill my current ally or even her servant. I can only hope it won&amp;#39;t cost me anything significant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After half an hour, I&amp;#39;d written down all the relevant information, along with help from Lancer, and had prepared the action plan for today. During the daytime, we would find and acquire a car for transport, then purchase citizen clothes for Lancer before heading to a bar to drink and relax for a few hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...I&amp;#39;m certain this would never be in my plans were it not for Lancer&amp;#39;s presence. It seems his layabout attitude rubs off on me, and, seeing as he&amp;#39;s currently flicking through the channels on the TV without a care in the world, it&amp;#39;s not going to cease anytime soon. I suppose I owe it to him, after all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer and I head out to the nearest car dealership, aiming to take out a commercial sports car on a monthly payment using false details, with basic hypnotism to make the process smooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having obtained our new transport, the streets somehow manage to be even more depressing than they were yesterday. In the past 20 years this city has been on the receiving end of three Holy Grail Wars, and the toll is clearly shown on the populace, even if unaware of its true nature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Such is the nature of how Magi do about their business...at the cost of everything deemed irrelevant. I must end this war as soon as possible, so that I may be able to at least repay the suffering brought upon some of the city.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thinking that, however, gives me an idea...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lancer, I think I should suggest that the Grail War be relocated to another country after this one. It&amp;#39;s clear that the aftermath is too taxing on one location of it runs on for too long in the same place.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer answers almost immediately as we&amp;#39;re walking. It seems his train of thought was similar to mine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, I&amp;#39;ve had enough of seeing this sort of scene for one lifetime...just hits a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; close to home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can&amp;#39;t fathom how Lancer is feeling right now, but if anything that our talk yesterday is enough to indicate, it&amp;#39;s intense enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locking up our newly-obtained transport and having Lancer dematerialize, we immediately begin moving to the nearest clothes store for men. I browse the various goods, with Lancer picking out his selection from behind me, before finally moving to the counter and purchasing them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...a few pairs of slacks, some 3/4 length trousers and a Hawaiian shirt for almost every colour imaginable. I can&amp;#39;t say I expected any less, but even the cheap straw hat to &amp;quot;complete th&amp;#39;image&amp;quot; was pushing it. The extent I&amp;#39;ll go for this old man...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Y&amp;#39;know, you really don&amp;#39;t have to do all this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While having him change in one of the rooms provided by the store, Lancer interrupts the silence out of nowhere. Considering the attitude he&amp;#39;s taken so far toward our partnership, this statement surprises me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The names of the roles of servant and master aren&amp;#39;t for show, and with the command seals you have packin&amp;#39;, there&amp;#39;s no real worry &amp;#39;bout me going turncoat...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now I see. For Lancer, being friends has only ever meant camaraderie to him. Whether as the son of a King, a politician or a soldier, he never truly established what could be seen as typical perspective on human relationships. I suppose that makes it my job to show him the way, despite not being an expert on it myself. But first...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This is simply what friends do for one-another, Lancer. You&amp;#39;ve covered my back more than enough times, so this is simply repaying the favour. Unless you weren&amp;#39;t aware of that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Judging by the strangled grunt and sudden sound of hangers falling, I believe my teasing was successful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;C-&amp;#39;course I knew that, waddya take this old man for?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before I can give a retort, the man in question emerges from the booth in his chosen getup, with straw hat conveniently shading his face from view. He wouldn&amp;#39;t look out of place in some sort of country-themed pop group, to be honest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well then, if the old man&amp;#39;s fine with his wisdom being validated, let&amp;#39;s head out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I say to him, a small giggle building up my throat. It isn&amp;#39;t too bad to get the better of him once in a while, though I get the feeling he&amp;#39;ll pay me back eventually. He&amp;#39;s got more than enough way with words, after all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaving the clothes store, I decide we shouldn&amp;#39;t linger too long in drinking before getting to action. Getting back into the car, Lancer now materialized and inconspicuous, we drive to the center of Fuyuki and order a few drinks as the first bar we find.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eventually, we come across a small-sized bar with a wooden signpost which catches our fancy - the &amp;#39;Copenhagen&amp;#39;. Once we enter we find ourselves urged by a middle-aged woman to find a seat. Seems hospitable enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seating ourselves, I take a look at the drinks menu laid out on the relatively small table Lancer and I are seated at. I don&amp;#39;t exactly frequent bars and other such establishments, but guessing by the wide variety of categories and the exotic names of the drinks on offer, this is a fairly well-maintained bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taking a look at my drinking partner, I see he has a slightly perplexed look on his face. Does the grail&amp;#39;s knowledge provided to servants not cover modern drinks?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Having issue deciding, Lancer?&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;I ask, a little concerned for the man who wanted to do something like this in the first place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nah, it&amp;#39;s not that, it&amp;#39;s just...squid ink and agave syrup? People drink that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somehow I get the feeling he&amp;#39;s judging me alongside the rest of mankind with that question. I&amp;#39;ll admit even I have to question that kind of cocktail, but people don&amp;#39;t sell it if nobody wants it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t you just try it? It can&amp;#39;t hurt for something exotic during an opportunity like this.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeming swayed by my words, we place our order of a &amp;#39;&lt;a href=\"http://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/food/restaurant-bar-reviews/weirdest-craziest-cocktails-where-to-drink-them/london-cocktail-club-squid-ink-sour\"&gt;Squid Ink Sour&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39; cocktail for Lancer, while I simply order a pint of Irish Cider which I had during the Christmas party in Clocktower leading to the war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah, so I see now. Yer &amp;#39;ol buddy has to stick with the wacky drink while you&amp;#39;re dandy with some plain old cider, huh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer is trying to look pissed, but he&amp;#39;s got a smile creeping on his face. With the pressure of the war hanging on our shoulders, it&amp;#39;s good to spend time messing around like this while we can. Even if it&amp;#39;s the taboo of drinking out during the day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After spending little over an hour having two or three light drinks and having casual talk, we eventually decide to make our way out. There are still some happenings across Fuyuki which we haven&amp;#39;t looked into even now, and could provide some clues as to the location of other masters or the identity of servants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I pay the moderate bill and thank the waiting staff, before heading outside and walking to our car.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lancer, do you happen to remember where the plane crush and sequentially, the location of Saber&amp;#39;s Noble Phantasm occurred?&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;I ask, as shamefully the details of that feel distant to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, sure, I&amp;#39;ll drive on to it. Gotta admit, these steel carriages of your time have some kick to &amp;#39;em!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer remarks, as he completely disregards reasonable speeding laws in the outer roads of Fuyuki. I don&amp;#39;t think it&amp;#39;s that bad though, since he&amp;#39;s kept to everything else...we&amp;#39;re such middle-aged men, aren&amp;#39;t we?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We soon arrive at the crash site to see most of the rubble and debris already cleared. The landscape is destroyed where it crashed and a few police officers are still investigating the scene.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can&amp;#39;t say I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting this, it has been a while, after all. I guess I just wanted to write this off on my list for completion&amp;#39;s sake. Concentrating a little, there&amp;#39;s not even any trace of prana to be found in the air.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Looks like there&amp;#39;s nothing for us here, unless you feel particularly obliged to interrogate the police.&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;I half-heartedly remark to Lancer, who now stands at my side with straw hat hung on his back like something I recall seeing on the TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, maybe we should just try the good &amp;#39;ol &amp;#39;returning to the scene of the crime&amp;#39; method if we wanna get somewhere.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back to the place we fought last night then...it&amp;#39;s likely we&amp;#39;ll run into some other masters there, not that it&amp;#39;s a bad thing. If we can&amp;#39;t get anywhere with investigation today, it might be better to observe others tomorrow night, instead of putting ourselves on the line. Rider&amp;#39;s true capabilities are still unknown, and the fact Berserker forced a Saber as famous as Sir Gawain of the round table to use his Noble Phantasm doesn&amp;#39;t bode well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Giving a short not in approval, we head back into the car and drive to a parking space nearest to the destroyed car park from last night, before walking to it. The scene before us is similar to the plane crash; lots of debris and a few cops investigating. They look really high strung and are looking for suspicious individuals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the number of police investigating, it&amp;#39;s not wise to hang around, however I do want to try and at least spot some other masters investigating...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I locate a nearby cafe alongside Lancer in order to observe the location for a while, and not long after he informs me that he feels the presence of the servant who fought Saber at the crash site on the first night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Likely to be Berserker then...why is his master taking him out during the daytime? This is bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lancer, we&amp;#39;re going to the crash site - We can&amp;#39;t trust Berserker&amp;#39;s master to not try something that may harm civilians or the police investigating.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I say, while quickly exiting the cafe through its door and walking onto the gloomy streets. Lancer, still materialized and in his choice clothing, follows behind me with a grim expression on his face before sighing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why&amp;#39;s it always gotta be this pattern of endangering the townspeople followed by regular fights in th&amp;#39; grail war? Really begins to wear you down, y&amp;#39;know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I doubt he&amp;#39;s expecting an answer from me, but I share his sentiments. In the past two days we&amp;#39;ve had far too many catastrophic accidents to my liking. It makes me feel like I&amp;#39;m the only reasonable master in this war, though I know that can&amp;#39;t be the case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berserker is easily found digging through the rubble in the wreck of the car park. He seems disinterested in us, but the powerful bloodlust of the Berserker class is permeating from him, nonetheless.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is he trying to find something...or someone buried in the rubble? Right now he seems to pose no threat, and starting a fight will simply escalate the situation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll keep observing him for now. If you think he&amp;#39;s up to something dangerous then feel free to attack him immediately.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer, now in his battle raiment with spear in hand, has a tenseness which emanates from his body. Berserker is the most unpredictable and awkward of all the servant classes, yet everyone has to respect its power.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As Berserker turns, his glowing red visor boring into us, I give berserker a little mocking wave, followed up by the &amp;#39;I&amp;#39;m watching you&amp;#39; gesture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer can&amp;#39;t help but give a small snicker in response, but this is mostly an act. Coming into the war, Berserker was the servant class I was most wary of, due to its unpredictable nature and overbearing strength. However, preventing further damage to the town is more important than my own fears. Lancer&amp;#39;s grip on his spear tightens slightly, betraying his carefree demeanour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berserker soon returns to his digging, before eventually finding a lamppost and running off with it, not looking like he is seeking combat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing Berserker flee suspiciously, I&amp;#39;m half tempted to chase after him. However, I still don&amp;#39;t truly trust any master that I don&amp;#39;t know personally, and having a servant appear in broad daylight to collect a piece of rubble either speaks for his master&amp;#39;s eccentricity...or the servant can use such an object in an effective manner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Weighing the options in my head, I decide it&amp;#39;s best to follow Berserker for a short while, making sure he isn&amp;#39;t doing anything untoward during daytime before leaving him. Lancer begins following Berserker at a distance, not showing a threatening presence but equally making himself known.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berserker turns behind him and makes an inarticulate gargle, and Lancer could swear he just got flipped off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Man, this guy&amp;#39;s one hell of a cheeky bastard.&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;Lancer remarks, ensuring Berserker&amp;#39;s in earshot, before turning back on the mad servant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Against my own expectations, it seems neither Berserker nor his master are up to anything untoward...though such a reckless action doesn&amp;#39;t seem to worth obtaining...a lamppost? I&amp;#39;m still wary of the servant, but it seems that at the least his master has him under control, which will change my priorities a little.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moving to our next course of action, I decide to regroup with Lancer and have him drive us to the docks. It seems to be a hotspot in running into servants of late, and I&amp;#39;m hoping I can gain information on any fights which may have happened while we were absent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arriving at the docks, Lancer soon feels the presence of another servant, this time our combatant from last night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So Rider it is...I&amp;#39;m not sure she&amp;#39;ll be willing to fight during daytime, but of all the servants I&amp;#39;ve fought or seen fighting extensively so far, she&amp;#39;s the only one which is a mystery. Perhaps we can glean some information from her or her master.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s head toward her, you can materialize in your casuals for this, might help the image of peace.&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;I tell Lancer, to which he grins heartily.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can&amp;#39;t help but enjoy today so far. It&amp;#39;s one thing to learn and know a person through constant battles for your life, but another to simply enjoy yourselves with one-another. Ever since coming to Clocktower, the closest things I&amp;#39;ve had to friends has been both him and Catia, the latter of which forgot what I looked like within a few months. Though it&amp;#39;s a bitter reminder of what I sacrificed by leaving Atlas to pursue a speciality derived from my craft, it makes it all the more refreshing in the time I have now. I might even be able to fight tonight with a smile on my face, though that&amp;#39;s probably the alcohol talking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing the non-threatening attitude, it seems Rider is approaching on our location, but is soon drowned out by a very familiar aura - that of our favourite black-and-red mad knight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even I can feel the more...vicious presence of Berserker this time. This may be bad, but multiple servants getting into a fight increases the odds of being able to team up and take down one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I begin to speak to Lancer, but he seems to have picked up on the situation quicker than I have, and is now dressed in his military garb with Durindana&amp;#39;s tip leaning against the ground menacingly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sheesh, we haven&amp;#39;t exactly been getting anywhere today and now I get that kinda feeling that we&amp;#39;re being jerked around a little...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer remarks, keeping his eyes peeled on his surroundings for both Rider and Berserker. A fight is becoming more and more likely, and being tired so early in the day will make bad tidings for what happens tonight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I bring out half of Pure Orichalcum&amp;#39;s mass and form it into a function shield, holding it in my right hand while leaving Lancer to guard my left. With two Servants in the vacinity and no idea of their true capabilities and grievances, I&amp;#39;m not taking any chances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With Rider nowhere to be seen, Berserker makes a mad lunge toward Lancer with his previously-witnessed street pole.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer quickly responds by cutting through the inferior material of the opposing weapon, but even faster than he can react, Berserker twirls the remains of his weapon and knocks Lancer&amp;#39;s spear upward, before grabbing it with his free hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My own servant attempts to distance his weapon from the grasping hand, before kicking Berserker in the chest, but finds the mad knight pouncing on him and forcing him to the ground.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shit, this is bad, Lancer can&amp;#39;t beat Berserker in a battle of raw strength, and I&amp;#39;m certain this is the exact situation Berserker want to be in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer, by power of this command seal, I order you, throw Berserker off of you!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Through the power of your Command Seal, Lancer successfully pushes Berserker off of him and through a wall of a warehouse building. Moment&amp;#39;s later, six precise water pipes come piercing through the wall in a rapid succession, moving as fast as a bullet and aiming straight for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simultaneously, Berserker comes crashing through the same wall while mounted atop an enhanced forklift.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taking immediate action, I shift my body to dodge most of the pipes while blocking the remainder with my formed shield. Taking in the impact, I&amp;#39;m tossed back several meters and off my feet, showing the clear power behind the throw.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Upon getting a new view of the situation, I find Berserker once again attacking Lancer using one of the &amp;#39;forks&amp;#39; from the vehicle, while the industrial transport itself is driving straight toward me at max speed-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer, feeling the clear difference in strength, tries to keep as much distance from Berserker as possible while keeping him at bay with safe, non-committal jabs with his spear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, I take out the remaining mass of Pure Orichalcum and form it into a sturdy ramp over my head, spanning the size of the forklift&amp;#39;s wheelspan, with the intention of redirecting the vehicle and launching it over my head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No words can or need to be said to Lancer. This is a do or die situation in which both of us must use our utmost capabilities to emerge with our lives. I can&amp;#39;t reflect on it in this moment, but the first few seconds of this encounter reinforced this sole fact:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berserker is a foe Lancer and I cannot defeat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The forklift safely soars over my head, riding off the makeshift ramp, while Lancer&amp;#39;s opponent makes a mad grab for his head. Lancer tries to back further off and make a cut at Berserker&amp;#39;s arms in response, hoping to buy more time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I suddenly spot Rider moving in to intervene with the fight, shouting:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Only animals interrupt the conversations of others!&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I weren&amp;#39;t currently fighting for my life, I&amp;#39;d call Rider out on how lame that line was. Right now, Lancer needs all the help he can get. In spite of that, I can&amp;#39;t do anything...if the nature of Berserker&amp;#39;s noble phantasm is that anything he touches becomes it, even my own Mystic Code will simply be giving him an advantage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All I can do now is trust in Lancer to pull through.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I hope you have a plan lancer otherwise it&amp;#39;s just honest fighting again.&amp;quot; Rider calls to lancer.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The two are now caught up in a deadly dance with the mad servant, each using their long-reach weapons to hold him at bay while creating opportunities to lands hits in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeaaaah well, to be honest, this guy likes to get a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; close for comfort when it comes to these sort of things. Even a-&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;Lancer stops his banter for a short moment to dodge an attempt at his neck by Berserker, before continuing,&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Even a fun-loving guy like me has limits to personal space, and he&amp;#39;s crossed all of &amp;#39;em. Several times.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even being Lancer&amp;#39;s master myself, I can&amp;#39;t help but marvel at Lancer&amp;#39;s ability to act cool even during a situation like this. However, I can&amp;#39;t let my guard down. I spy a man walking toward me at a leisurely pace in the midst of the combat, I can&amp;#39;t help but be wary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;State your identity and business!&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;I shout, one eye on them while the other desperately trying to follow the conflict between the three legendary heroes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I watch as Rider gets kicked across the entire length of the docks by Berserker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rider emerged from the rubble which she was knocked into. &amp;quot;Hmm so no plan at all. Perfect.&amp;quot;, she comments, before jumping back into the fray launching mid range attacks at Berserker&amp;#39;s back to try lessen his pressure on Lancer. &amp;quot;I doubt this is a servant normal fighting can beat. I do recall him losing an arm a few days ago, look at him now.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shortly after, Berserker begins to ignore Rider&amp;#39;s attacks and charges Lancer with a powerful swing, weapon in hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The approaching man stopped and held up both hands up. &amp;quot;Woow, I&amp;#39;m unarmed.&amp;quot;, he says with a level of disbelief.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hmm names right? I am Revolutionary Lye but you would know me as master of Rider. I believe you came to talk before that black monster attacked though I must ask if you guys brought him here along the way?&amp;quot; He speaks in a casual tone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;That thing&amp;#39;s master isn&amp;#39;t here in any case.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re suspecting of this being a set-up, then I&amp;#39;m just as surprised to have him come out of nowhere as you are.&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;I say, retracting the spear I drew as a precautionary back into Pure Orichalcum&amp;#39;s main mass, but keeping the shield on hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I only threatened him as a precaution for if he actually happened to be Berserker&amp;#39;s master or Assassin with some sort of disguise. As far as I care, Rider and her master are allies at the moment, and I can do with all the help I can get.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I watch as the black beast manages to send Rider halfway across the docks, before already charging back toward Lancer, undeterred. There&amp;#39;s no doubt that Berserker is one of, if not the strongest servant in the war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lancer&amp;#39;s already established he can&amp;#39;t be Berserker one on one, and his Noble Phantasm is useless against Berserker while he&amp;#39;s in the state he&amp;#39;s in. What I&amp;#39;m saying is if you don&amp;#39;t want to servants to be killed by him, you&amp;#39;re the one who needs to play the trump cards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All the while, Lancer cuts the length of Berserker&amp;#39;s makeshift weapon which he uses to attack the servant in half, leaving him essentially unarmed. Rider throws her chains and temporarily restricts his left arm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Master of Lancer, you still haven&amp;#39;t told me why you came to talk before Berserker attacked. You ask much of me to play my trump cards while me and my servant can escape easily. I do not wish to abandon someone so quickly but I currently have little incentive to commit so much in this fight.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hmm, though I see his point, my reasoning is going to be rather flimsy in comparison.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In all honesty, I just was fishing for information. Give some sort of equivalent exchange, then we could both go off on our ways with better information concerning our foes in the war. If it came down to it, I&amp;#39;d offer a straight fight with your servant, considering last night was a little unsatisfactory for Lancer and I.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I say, giving him a sceptical look. I can only try to convey the disdain in my voice in levelling an entire car park in an attempt to harm his opponents, which would obviously be futile against a servant worth their salt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Plus, to be entirely honest, my Lancer&amp;#39;s an easier foe than Berserker. If we can team up to take out a heavyweight in the war now, then both of us won&amp;#39;t have to fret over him in the future. With your full assistance, I can guarantee we will be capable of defeating him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have a little hesitation in my voice, I do not truly know the full capabilities of Rider, however I have to give a confident sales pitch now if I want any chance of killing Berserker today. This whole deal has done nothing but prove that servant is my top priority if I want any chance in winning the war with Lancer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He smiles a little at the response. &amp;quot;You aren&amp;#39;t the only one unsatisfied with last night&amp;#39;s fight. True Berserker&amp;#39;s actions do not sit well with me. I have a feeling its master has a pretty deep mana pool or is just insane. I guess a temporary truce is fine until Berserker is taken care of.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He calls out to Rider. &amp;quot;Rider you are allowed to use your noble phantasm against Berserker. I don&amp;#39;t know what it does but try not to destroy our safe house. We don&amp;#39;t want a large firework display calling everyone.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turning back to he asks- &amp;quot;What is the name of the man I will work with for now? Also tell lancer to be careful I honestly don&amp;#39;t know what rider is going to do, but what ever it is make sure Berserker doesn&amp;#39;t escape from it.&amp;quot; He begins to slowly back away from the area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Meanwhile, Berserker manages to grab one of Rider&amp;#39;s chains and pulls him close to him with his immense strength. At the same time, Lancer successfully lands a clean slash across Berserker&amp;#39;s fight shoulder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Lancer help me get some distance and get ready. Our masters have come to an agreement.&amp;quot;, Rider calls to Lancer, with a hint of urgency as she is overpowered by Berserker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lancer, you heard her. Occupy Berserker for as long as possible then haul your ass out of there once her Noble Phantasm has been unleashed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I order Lancer through our mental connection, content with the cooperation of Rider&amp;#39;s master. The next few moments will be key, but pleasantries can come first. Turning back to Rider&amp;#39;s master, I greet him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Kishtar Andar Tahwil, an Alchemist from Atlas and by extension a magus from Clocktower. Pleased to meet your acquaintance, though I&amp;#39;d prefer it if you call me Kishtar.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I perhaps feel slightly uneasy about his ignorance of Rider&amp;#39;s Noble Phantasm, however. Do they have some form of tension between them, or is he bluffing in order to trick me? I&amp;#39;m too far invested in this battle at the moment to consider the possibilities, but I can just weigh all my chances on the coming moments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hmm nice to meet you Kishtar. The clocktower is no friend of mine though Atlas is fine I guess.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer helps free Rider by slicing the chain between her and Berserker.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was hoping the chain didn&amp;#39;t have to be destroyed. Anyway get back lancer!&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;Rider calls out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After making some distance from Berserker, Rider slices her throat and a sigil quickly forms from the blood spraying out her neck. I feel an intense surge of magical energy and have to cover my eyes to avoid being blinded by a white streak of light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer sprints away from Berserker as fast as he can manage, responding to Rider&amp;#39;s slightly grotesque means of preparing her Noble Phantasm.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Jeez, I never knew you were into that kinda play, Rider...&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;He can&amp;#39;t help but comment jokingly as his vision begins to get blurred by the white light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lancer,&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;, I start, realizing I should warn him before the moment arrives,&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot;Be prepared to secure Berserker&amp;#39;s death with your Noble Phantasm if necessary. You should know when it&amp;#39;s appropriate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I catch a glimpse of a goatee&amp;#39;d nod before I can no longer see lancer through the daze of Rider&amp;#39;s Noble Phantasm activating. For safety, I hold up my morphed shield and try to block out the glare of light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The blinding disappears as quickly as it came. Rider had not moved, and Berserker is nowhere to be seen. It seems as though he was saved by the power of a Command Seal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My eyes eventually recover from their temporary blindness, and spot my very short-lived ally still by my side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Hmmm how disappointing, another lukewarm end to a fight. It looks like Berserker&amp;#39;s master is pretty tactical to use command seal right then, not a psycho then.&amp;quot; I say to Kistar. &amp;quot;What now? I guess we can have a proper talk now Berserker is gone or something.&amp;quot; He calls out to Rider asking her to come to his side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer moves to my side after his short retreat without being asked. I can&amp;#39;t say that I wasn&amp;#39;t expecting the command seal to be used, but I&amp;#39;m disappointed we couldn&amp;#39;t kill Berserker or draw out something to compromise his identity. Lancer has a similar disappointed expression, but it seems to be more focused on Rider than anyone else...interesting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Would you be willing to trade information? In the current stages of the war I have no interest in an alliance, though I wouldn&amp;#39;t mind giving help in taking down the likes of Berserker or Saber should it come down to it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I feel like it would be...some form of cheating to enter an open alliance or even truce with another master while I still have my current one with Cat, even if it could be advantageous. Speaking of Cat, I haven&amp;#39;t seen her since Caster&amp;#39;s death last night...her Servant seems competent, but I hope she&amp;#39;s safe regardless.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Something else also pops into mind-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How odd, I gave you my name but I don&amp;#39;t remember ever asking for yours, Master of Rider.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Too many faces remain without names due to my inability to give common courtesy of late, a minor but irritating downfall of mine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even so, Lancer seems unusually solemn for someone who keeps up a constant mask. Has this loss really gotten him that down or is it something to do with Rider? I swear, if it&amp;#39;s him being lecherous I&amp;#39;ll be the one to give him a clear scolding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;I am a Child of the Phoenix, a dying group whose only wish is to save the world. I do not know what name my parents gave me but I was called Lye. when I swore to carry the will of the Phoenix I was given the title Revolutionary so I now am Revolutionary Lye.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Yea an alliance is definitely impossible now but the actions of team Berserker intrigues me. It honestly makes me wants to burn them slowly so the souls are deeply cleansed though they definitely will be troublesome to defeat. I am up for working together but only to defeat Berserker.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Honestly the only information I have worth giving are the circumstances of team Saber, Rider tell them.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rider nods and continues. &amp;quot;The Master was on a commercial plane coming to participate in the war when everyone else on board was rendered unconscious probably by magic. Even Saber, someone who undoubtedly has an excellent riding skill was unable to control the disabled plane. After escaping the plane they were attacked by Berserker who forced the use of Excalibur Galatine from Saber. The attacked forced Berserker to escape after taking out his right arm.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Thank you Rider, that&amp;#39;s all I can offer for now, but it begs the question of whether Berserker&amp;#39;s attack after the plane crash was a mere coincidence&amp;quot;, Lye finally concludes his supply of information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So in summary, a religious nutjob. Just what I need. A savior for the world can&amp;#39;t be found in focus groups with eccentric madmen, it&amp;#39;s found in single madmen with great focus in their speciality. There&amp;#39;s a reason no heroic spirit can be summoned as more than one or two people. Groups never succeed as single legends.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That information regarding Saber of yours is pretty interesting. The best guess of mine would be that Caster was the one to attack the airline, but could not predict Saber&amp;#39;s capabilities as a heroic spirit, and decided not to further her attack once Berserker engaged.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I take a short break in voicing my thoughts, when Lancer actually picks up where I left off. It seems he got out of his reverie, and is now wearing his regular dumbass grin and lax demeanour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All that really ends up tellin&amp;#39; ya is that Caster and her master were here &amp;#39;fore the war really got goin...not that it matters with the witch bein&amp;#39; dead n all. Guess we have to spill the beans &amp;#39;bout our compadre, eh Kishtar?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at him, getting all fancy with his vocabulary. Were it not for the need to look good in front of Lye, I&amp;#39;d probably be wrestling him to the ground by now. Even now, the good spirit brought to me from this afternoon remains in my behaviour.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yeah, the only real person I can give worthwhile information about is Archer&amp;#39;s master.&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;I pause for a moment, considering how to approach. Cat is still my friend and ally, so I can&amp;#39;t spill everything about her, especially not the identity of her servant...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s a magus from a minor bloodline, and doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be affiliated with Clocktower, in spite of studying there. She uses some branch of non-offensive wind magecraft, and she summoned Archer in the docks of the town on the first day. She doesn&amp;#39;t seem particularly experienced in the war or fighting in general, but her servant seems skilled and versatile.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That&amp;#39;s about as much as I can offer to the enemy master. Perhaps I&amp;#39;d be more willing to talk about other topics were he someone I feel I can get along with, but people with grand visions without reasonable means to reach it just strike me as deluded. Consider your ability to save one person or a hundred being thinking you can save the entire human race...not that I&amp;#39;d say that in person, reserved as I am.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Yea that&amp;#39;s right Caster is dead but her master still lives. She still could do something reckless as a final push for the war... I know I would.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rider cuts in to stop her Master&amp;#39;s rambling, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry Lancer I will protect my master at all cost, as much as I also want to finish our fight, my master&amp;#39;s safety and wishes take priority. First thing being the defeat of Berserker, after that maybe we can finish things.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Master continues;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;O Rider you can say strange things, anyway Kishtar how would I contact you for anything related to team Berserker as temporary as this friendship is.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A way of contact? I suppose I could be creative...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I form a small ball bearing out of Pure Orichalcum the size of a typical marble, and throw it to him, before adding:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That piece of metal will be naturally obliged to rejoin with my Mystic Code. Keep it contained in a pocket or something else safe, then release it if you want to talk. We&amp;#39;ll meet at the Copenhagen in downtown, it has some decent drinks from my own experience.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If that&amp;#39;s all you wish to talk about, I suppose we&amp;#39;ll be heading off...though the fact you don&amp;#39;t know the nature of your servant&amp;#39;s Noble Phantasm is interesting, to say the least...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer, seeing the intention of the rest of my sentence, decides to cut in for me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I still wanna finish our fight from the other day, so keep yer master safe, alright Rider? You...nah, nevermind. It&amp;#39;s not my business.&amp;quot;, &lt;em&gt;He seems to almost try to say something meaningful before trailing off into a whisper. I&amp;#39;m not even sure Lye could hear it, but Rider&amp;#39;s excellent senses must have picked it up. Lancer certainly knows something about her.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lancer and I begin walking back to our car, while I check my watch to check the time. Our next course of action is still up in the air.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#39;s that. The conclusion of this perspective will be the next part in:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KISHTAR&amp;#39;S BIZARRE ADVENTURE PART 4: MYSTIC CODE IS UNBREAKABLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

With vodka, you're just looking for purity... it is scientifically possible to make a perfect vodka.  Please never pay much for vodka.\n |Here's *the worst scam I've ever heard*: a marketer buys bulk Grain Neutral Spirits from a provider (there are lots).  This gets shipped at 95%abv.  The marketer receives it, and then cuts it down with local water.  Once you cut down the GNS to 40%abv, presto, you have vodka.  Pass it through some still you picked up and all of a sudden you can say \"Locally Distilled Vodka with Fresh Local Water\"\n |**Edit:** My response to huxley2112 got buried, so putting it here. In my example I used GNS interchangably with high proof bulk vodka, and perhaps I shouldn't, but in my context of misleading labeling it's the same deal: i.e., pretending that a spirit was distilled somewhere it wasn't.

Wineries got a lot of political clout during the end of the last century, and successfully lobbied their state gov'ts to let them sell direct to visitors.  This started in the west coast.  Then along came NY and MI, who did the same for their wineries, but still forbid out-of-state wineries from shipping into the state.  So if you lived in NYC and visited a winery in the Finger Lakes, you could go home and call them up for direct shipment, but not a winery you visited in California.  Out of state wineries would still first have to get their product listed by an NY wholesaler.\n |In a weird split (not ideological), 5 Supreme Court Justices said this kind of discrimination violated the commerce clause.  The reason it was only 5 was because Section 2 of the 21st Amendment actually gave states a lot of leeway to develop insane parochial laws.\n |Happy to go on and talk about ramifications here... it's a very interesting landscape that's shifting all the time.\n[Cheers! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1alo38/im_owneroperator_of_a_liquor_store_am_overwhelmed/c8yprx4?context=5)|Texas fiercely defends its domestic distribution channels (mainly at the behest of Texas-licensed wholesalers), so they don't let people ship into their state.\n[Do you see the future of liquor laws being more or less restrictive in this regard (selling across state lines directly from the manufacturer\\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1alo38/im_owneroperator_of_a_liquor_store_am_overwhelmed/c8yqoow?context=5)|The trend has been to a more liberalized market for wineries (per the Supreme Court's **order**).  But retailers have been losing ground (i.e., fewer states they can ship to).  Breweries and distilleries have been forgotten altogether.  The main reason is because the plaintiffs in the 2005 Scotus case were wineries, so the states have decided to implement the Scotus decision as narrowly as possible by only opening inter-state commerce to wineries.\n[Where does this come from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1alo38/im_owneroperator_of_a_liquor_store_am_overwhelmed/c8yk251?context=5)|Very good question and I'm glad you asked because I realize it's listed on my site now (may have to remove that product page).

Putting that aside though, I'm at the point where I really prefer high proof spirits... 45%abv-62.5%abv (often called \"cask strength\").\n |I've got a sweet tooth and I like complexity, so I look for a diverse mash bill.  A \"single malt\" (reading that to mean 100% malted barley) could be a bit boring on its own.  My favorite mash bill for unaged whiskey is Wasmund's Rye Spirit: 2/3rds rye (sweet), 1/3 malted barley (smoky).\n[Which liquors are actually worth the money for the more expensive stuff?  Rums?

Personally, I'm not remotely impressed by claims of 10year+ ageing.  One company, called Terressentia (I've visited their plant), has a process for removing unpleasant congeners (rapid ageing, but better).  They can take white dog whiskey, put it through their machines, and 6 hours later it'll beat a 20yo Scotch in a blind taste test.  So truth be told, I don't think liquor should ever be too expensive (check your region's taxes though).\n |I have locavore tendencies - I'm happy to pay a premium to support a nearby farmer and a nearby distiller.  It's actually amazing to me that micro-distillers can make a gin for $30 and still squeak out a profit, compared to major-labels which buy bulk GNS for $2 a liter.\n[Would Johnny walker blue label be considered overpriced as compared to say, red label or chivas (or any other similar whisky\\), or is it actually worth it?

Prices do not reflect cost to the producer, they reflect what the market will pay.\n |For Single Malt whiskey that is distilled &amp; bottled by a certain distillery, the prices are more likely to be grounded in actual supply &amp; demand.\n[How do you feel about underage drinking?

Is it better than those that aren't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1alo38/im_owneroperator_of_a_liquor_store_am_overwhelmed/c8yn5w4?context=5)|The government taxes beverage alcohol the moment it's created... for liquor it's a whopping $13.50 a gallon; in Canada it's $11 a liter!  These production taxes are called excise taxes.\n |So if you're operating a still, you owe that money to the government the moment the liquor flows off the still.  Obviously paying the excise tax that moment isn't viable.  So the way it works is that you (the distiller) procure a bond, and you assign the right to the bond to the government.  The amount of the bond will depend on the size of your still and your theoretical production capacity in a given month.  The point is that the bond should cover all the excise taxes that would be owed if you ran your still non-stop for a month and then went on the lamb.  So when the revenue agent comes to get their money and you're gone, at least they can recover from your bond issuer (who will in turn then hunt you down).\n |Inside your distillery you'll have a \"bonded warehouse\".  Within this space you're expected to store all your alcohol, because once it's removed from the bonded warehouse, you owe the excise tax (unless you put it on a bonded truck for export out of the country).\n[With this all given, what are the indicators of stuff that's actually worth the money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1alo38/im_owneroperator_of_a_liquor_store_am_overwhelmed/c8yjjxa?context=5)|Thankfully it's 2013, and it's not hard to check out if something's legit. Best answer is check out the distillery's Facebook page.  Most distillers want to show off their work.  If they've only got one small still, and you can't find their product, then the scarcity can certainly be real.\n |IMO ageing is way, way overhyped by the established industry, who are sitting on warehouses full of the stuff.\n[Alright, truth be told, I'm clueless for the most part about spirits, but I know that I enjoy them more than I enjoy beer.

I like bourbon a lot, but I tend to like them all.  The gov't is pretty strict about using the word bourbon (min 51% corn and stored at not more than 62.5% abv (125 proof) in charred new oak containers).

But what you need to know is that vodka is a neutral spirit, it's not supposed to have any flavor.  All beverage alcohol is a chemical solution of some sort, you never get to 100% alcohol in the commercial marketplace.  For vodka though, the alcohol should be as thoroughly distilled as possible (congeners removed), and then cut back down with water with a specific ph level.  Getting that high degree of distillation costs more than a lower level, which a fuel ethanol refinery could just do on the side for you.\n |Whiskey is different, you want a lot of the congeners from the grain to carry over during the distillation.\n[Do you have an opinion on the Wiggle Whiskey being made in Pittsburgh?

Then along came NY and MI, who did the same for their wineries, but still forbid out-of-state wineries from shipping into the state.  So if you lived in NYC and visited a winery in the Finger Lakes, you could go home and call them up for direct shipment, but not a winery you visited in California.

But retailers have been losing ground (i.e., fewer states they can ship to).  Breweries and distilleries have been forgotten altogether.  The main reason is because the plaintiffs in the 2005 Scotus case were wineries, so the states have decided to implement the Scotus decision as narrowly as possible by only opening inter-state commerce to wineries.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1alo38/im_owneroperator_of_a_liquor_store_am_overwhelmed/c8yk251?context=5\"&gt;Where does this come from?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Very good question and I&amp;#39;m glad you asked because I realize it&amp;#39;s listed on my site now (may have to remove that product page).

Putting that aside though, I&amp;#39;m at the point where I really prefer high proof spirits... 45%abv-62.5%abv (often called &amp;quot;cask strength&amp;quot;).&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I&amp;#39;ve got a sweet tooth and I like complexity, so I look for a diverse mash bill.  A &amp;quot;single malt&amp;quot; (reading that to mean 100% malted barley) could be a bit boring on its own.  My favorite mash bill for unaged whiskey is Wasmund&amp;#39;s Rye Spirit: 2/3rds rye (sweet), 1/3 malted barley (smoky).&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1alo38/im_owneroperator_of_a_liquor_store_am_overwhelmed/c8yk3m6?context=5\"&gt;Which liquors are actually worth the money for the more expensive stuff?  Rums?  Whiskey?   &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Well, that&amp;#39;s tough to say.  Personally, I&amp;#39;m not remotely impressed by claims of 10year+ ageing.  One company, called Terressentia (I&amp;#39;ve visited their plant), has a process for removing unpleasant congeners (rapid ageing, but better).  They can take white dog whiskey, put it through their machines, and 6 hours later it&amp;#39;ll beat a 20yo Scotch in a blind taste test.  So truth be told, I don&amp;#39;t think liquor should ever be too expensive (check your region&amp;#39;s taxes though).&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I have locavore tendencies - I&amp;#39;m happy to pay a premium to support a nearby farmer and a nearby distiller.

Obviously paying the excise tax that moment isn&amp;#39;t viable.  So the way it works is that you (the distiller) procure a bond, and you assign the right to the bond to the government.  The amount of the bond will depend on the size of your still and your theoretical production capacity in a given month.  The point is that the bond should cover all the excise taxes that would be owed if you ran your still non-stop for a month and then went on the lamb.  So when the revenue agent comes to get their money and you&amp;#39;re gone, at least they can recover from your bond issuer (who will in turn then hunt you down).&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Inside your distillery you&amp;#39;ll have a &amp;quot;bonded warehouse&amp;quot;.

Do you agree/could you explain this a little better to me?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Yes, I&amp;#39;ve heard the same, that the science doesn&amp;#39;t support GG&amp;#39;s success.  But what you need to know is that vodka is a neutral spirit, it&amp;#39;s not supposed to have any flavor.  All beverage alcohol is a chemical solution of some sort, you never get to 100% alcohol in the commercial marketplace.  For vodka though, the alcohol should be as thoroughly distilled as possible (congeners removed), and then cut back down with water with a specific ph level.  Getting that high degree of distillation costs more than a lower level, which a fuel ethanol refinery could just do on the side for you.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Whiskey is different, you want a lot of the congeners from the grain to carry over during the distillation.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1alo38/im_owneroperator_of_a_liquor_store_am_overwhelmed/c8ymciz?context=5\"&gt;Do you have an opinion on the Wiggle Whiskey being made in Pittsburgh?  I love the idea of artisanal spirits but I&amp;#39;m afraid my wallet does not. Lol &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried it and liked it a lot, from what I know they seem legit (meme reference not intended!).

With Federal Spirits though, I&amp;#39;m trying to bring more diversity to the marketplace, so am sourcing from small upstarts doing their own distilling.

I&amp;#39;ve been on a Glen Morangie 10-year-old tear lately, but am wondering what else is out there at that price point.  (BTW I live in DC, so this likely would result in a sale.)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;If you like Scotch, pick up a bottle of Wasmund&amp;#39;s Single Malt Spirit, distilled in Virginia.  The barley was developed at Virginia Tech in their seed development farm, and he malts it himself.  You can also pick it up aged, as Wasmund&amp;#39;s Single Malt Whisky: &lt;a href=\"http://www.virginialiving.com/articles/made-in-virginia-awards-2012-wasmunds\"&gt;Link to www.virginialiving.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http://www.federalspirits.com/collections/vendors?q=Copper+Fox+Distillery\"&gt;Link to www.federalspirits.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1alo38/im_owneroperator_of_a_liquor_store_am_overwhelmed/c8yoojr?context=5\"&gt;Always wanted to know this, and I&amp;#39;m sure its an easy answer: but why are certain liquors not sold in the US or hard to get in the US? I guess some examples that come to mind would be Johnny Walker Double Black (which is now widely available in the US) or Hennessy White. I always thought it was due to alcoholic content being too high, but its exactly the same here. What standards do they follow in choosing what can be sold in the US?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I think that&amp;#39;d be entirely decisions of their brand owners, not any regulatory issue.  Both Diageo (Walker) and LVMH have no problem with U.S. distribution channels.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1alo38/im_owneroperator_of_a_liquor_store_am_overwhelmed/c8yoqhb?context=5\"&gt;I heard if you put cheap whiskey through a britta water filter a few times, it should give you less of a hangover. Is this true?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Not sure, but wouldn&amp;#39;t think so.  The congeners that give you a hang over would be a bit harder to get at... and most distillers are already using like a 1-micron filter.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1alo38/im_owneroperator_of_a_liquor_store_am_overwhelmed/c8ykh4w?context=5\"&gt;My buddy works for Vermont Spirits!

I know there are many different kind of beers with the same ingredients, but I wonder if it&amp;#39;s the same with rum.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Beyond feedstock, other things can affect the taste, most notably the size and type of still, and I guess ageing, but it&amp;#39;s tough to say.  The ingredients could have been slightly different... rum can be from the fermented juice of sugar cane, sugar cane syrup, sugar cane molasses or other sugar cane by-products.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I had Dogfish Head Brown Honey Rum - really liked it.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1alo38/im_owneroperator_of_a_liquor_store_am_overwhelmed/c8ykek7?context=5\"&gt;I might have to swing by and check out your store this weekend.  Edit: Nevermind you only sell online.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;I would love to have a B&amp;amp;M store some day and do tastings.  If I did that now though, overhead pressure would demand that I have a ton of volume, and most micro distillers aren&amp;#39;t in a position to be sending one B&amp;amp;M shop a pallet a week.&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last updated: 2013-03-23 23:17 UTC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was generated by a robot!
