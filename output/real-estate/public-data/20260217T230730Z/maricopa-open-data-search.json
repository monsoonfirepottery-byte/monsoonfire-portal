In jurisdictional and presidential preference elections, voting precincts or parts of voting precincts may be grouped together into consolidated precincts. In this dataset, there are 956 voting precincts which were approved by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors on October 1, 2025 and then effective for use on Jan 2, 2026. Within this set of voting precincts, there are 6 NVP precincts. These NVP precincts were created due to the misalignment of LD and CD boundaries from the Arizona Redistricting Commission in 2022, and also due to the way the new CD and LD boundaries intertwined with Supervisor District and Justice Precinct boundaries. This is 17 less NVP precincts than the previous set of voting precincts, which was accomplished with the help of the Justice Courts modifying the Justice Precinct boundaries at the same time as the Voting Precincts. In prior reprecincting efforts, the voting precincts were re-numbered, 1-N, based on each precinct name and its alphabetical order. This set of voting precincts did not follow that pattern and was not renumbered. Any new precincts added in this set re-used voting precinct numbers associated with precincts that had been removed (NVP precincts &amp; Clover precinct) or new numbers beyond the previous maximum number of 935.</span></span></p>",
