However, they aren’t quite sure how to manage an assistant. I just spontaneously reached out to see if a role was open and we were a match :)\n\nIt’s my first time as a studio assistant, I’m supposed to work only 4-6 hrs/week for now (another assistant with experience might also join, and I do feel like the tasks are a lot for those hours). My tasks so far have been cleaning, on and off trimming and glazing class pieces and sometimes wedging for classes or doing reclaim. Of course I’m supposed to step in for some kiln duties as well in the future.\n\nI would love to hear suggestions of best practices or great ideas that you have in your studios, especially regarding: cleaning schedules, firing schedules, manging pieces from classes, glaze and shelves organisation etc. They are already working on a system but I still wanna show initiative and most importantly suggest a weekly schedule for my duties.\n\nI hope my question makes sense and that I have given enough info :) I’m just so happy with this opportunity and I really wanna do my best to do a great job.

If it doesn’t, the website isn&amp;#39;t working hard enough for you.\nI’m currently based at the Abu Dhabi Corniche and head to Dubai every weekend. I’m looking to connect with a few more business owners who are tired of &amp;quot;agency fluff&amp;quot; and want a digital storefront that actually converts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Check out my latest work and concepts here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://jadzein.fr\"&gt;https://jadzein.fr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Would love to hear your thoughts or answer any questions about improving your conversion rates!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don’t hesitate to send me a DM &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;*ps ai was used to write this post .&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I came in the next day and noticed the firing took way too long for a glaze and clicked review. It was programmed to cone 05 (bisque). At this time the kiln was roughly 1290 degrees Fahrenheit. So the kiln reached 1899 degrees Fahrenheit and cooled quite a bit.\n\nMy question is, would it be safe for me to just restart the kiln now without it causing issues with glaze crawling or running too much?\n\nMy gut tells me it’s fine but where the kiln is loaded with student and member work I don’t want to risk ruining other people’s work.\n\nThanks so much!",

I loaded a glaze kiln and had another studio assistant program and start the kiln after I left. I came in the next day and noticed the firing took way too long for a glaze and clicked review. It was programmed to cone 05 (bisque). At this time the kiln was roughly 1290 degrees Fahrenheit. So the kiln reached 1899 degrees Fahrenheit and cooled quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My question is, would it be safe for me to just restart the kiln now without it causing issues with glaze crawling or running too much?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My gut tells me it’s fine but where the kiln is loaded with student and member work I don’t want to risk ruining other people’s work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks so much!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Welcome to **Day 41** of my epic **PRITIBIMB Series** – where we dive deep into legendary figures who shaped our world with grit, genius, and relentless innovation. Today's spotlight: **Thomas Alva Edison**, the deaf inventor from humble roots who racked up 1,093 US patents, birthed the light bulb we know, the phonograph, and motion pictures, turning \"impossible\" into everyday magic.\n\nBorn February 11, 1847, in Milan, Ohio (happy birthday vibes even in 2026!), Edison grew up in Port Huron, Michigan, as the last of seven kids to Samuel and Nancy Edison. Homeschooled by his teacher mom after just months in school, he devoured books on electricity and philosophy, sparking his tinkering genius – think selling newspapers on trains at 13, launching his own paper *Grand Trunk Herald*, and saving a kid from a train to learn telegraphy. By 15, he was a night-shift telegrapher experimenting nonstop, despite partial deafness from scarlet fever that he later said helped him focus like a laser.\n\n# Early Hustle to Invention Factory 🚂💥\n\nEdison's first patent hit at 21: an electric vote recorder that flopped commercially but fueled his fire. In NYC by 1869, he teamed with mentors, built stock tickers earning $40k (big bucks then), and quadruplex telegraphs sending four messages on one wire for $30k more. The game-changer? 1876's Menlo Park lab in NJ – the world's first industrial R&amp;D spot, stocked with 8,000 chemicals, every screw imaginable, even peacock feathers and shark teeth for experiments. He drove teams 18-hour days, crediting \"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration,\" birthing hits like the carbon microphone boosting telephones.​\n\n# Iconic Inventions That Changed Everything 🎙️💡\n\n* **Phonograph (1877)**: Tinfoil cylinder recorded/playback \"Mary Had a Little Lamb\" – Edison became \"Wizard of Menlo Park.\" Evolved to wax cylinders, talking dolls (flop), then entertainment gold selling 3,000 records by 1900, though radio later tanked it.\n* **Incandescent Light Bulb (1879)**: Not first, but his bamboo filament lasted 1,200+ hours at 110V DC – patented after 6k+ experiments. Pearl Street Station (1882) lit 10k lamps for 500 NYC customers, kicking off electric grids. Beat gas lamps despite \"War of Currents\" vs. AC rivals like Westinghouse (he even backed AC electric chairs to smear it).​\n* **Motion Pictures (1890s)**: Kinetograph camera and Kinetoscope peep-show with Dickson; first synced sound attempts; Black Maria studio was world's first film factory.​\n\nFun fact: Tasimeter measured solar eclipse heat; fluoroscope pioneered X-rays (but he quit after assistants' injuries).\n\n# Business Empires, Flops &amp; Legacy 🏭⚡\n\nEdison built fortunes: Edison Electric Light Co. with J.P. Morgan, but merged into GE after AC wars (he lost control, sold shares bitter). Mining flop cost millions separating low-grade iron (biggest failure), pivoted to cement kilns licensing royalties into 1920s. Batteries for EVs with Henry Ford (nickel-iron lasted but too late for market); even cockroach-zapping devices!\n\nWest Orange lab (1887) dwarfed Menlo Park, survived 1914 fire. Died Oct 18, 1931, at 84 from diabetes – Ford collected his last breath in a test tube. Today, his DC grids evolved, but teamwork model powers Silicon Valley.\n\n**Sources**: Primary deets from [Thomas Edison Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison). Reddit series style, fun facts.\n\nWhat a beast! Edison: solo myth or team wizard? Light bulb fave invention? Upvote if sparked, comment Day 42 requests (hint: more icons?).

I have an interview in 9 days and would like to prep for a major career change. \n\n**\\*\\*\\*BACK STORY\\*\\*\\***\n\nI am getting older (b.1987) and I am at this point in my life where I want a job that is meaningful and brings me joy. I make good money at an airline and I have a leadership position. Aviation is awesome and so fun, but it feels like it’s selfish of me to keep going in this field, especially with long days and irregular hours. At one point, I was working 12+ hour days with no days off for 3 weeks. I didn’t see my son during that time due to his school schedule and my work schedule being complete opposites. I don’t get to do normal Mom stuff because I am never home. \n\nMy hobbies have always been drawing, painting, paper crafting… basically anything where I get to show my artistic side. I sold quite a few pet portraits, a few tattoo drawings, and nsfw Galentines. I’ve drawn and created plenty of holidays displays at the airports I’ve worked at. \n\nMy fiancé asked a few weeks ago, ‘If money wasn’t a factor, what would you want to be?’ Immediately: ARTIST. It has always been my passion, but it has always been a side gig. It’s brought me a few dollars here and there but never anything steady enough to quit my day job. \n\n2 years ago, I start following a local pottery studio thats opened in my area. I always like their posts and I love what they put out on their socials. So the other day, I took a leap. I went to their website to check for job postings. Nothing posted. Instead, it says something along the lines of, ‘We want people who seek us out and want to work with us!’ I fill out the information and toot my horn the best that I can without sounding arrogant. I did that on Friday around noon. At 3pm, I went to the actual studio to introduce myself. I’ve never done that and my heart was racing. I asked if they had any openings and she said, ‘Currently, no.’\n\nDreams crushed. \n\nShe asked about my pottery experience which is limited to modeling clay and a year’s worth of ceramics classes in high school. I did explain that I helped load and unload kilns (for extra credit heh heh). Then after some light-hearted conversation, she let me know they were opening two new locations. One is 10 minutes from my house! She explains they don’t have a timeline for the new locations yet because they are being demo’d and renovated. I keep it light and casual and she tells me if there is anything I would be a fit for based on my application info, they will call me. We exchange pleasantries and off I go. My heart is pounding out of my chest as I walk to my car. \n\nMonday night, I get an email asking if I want to interview! Tuesday (today), we settle on Friday, Feb 20. I feel like this is kismet. \n\nOnly problem is, my work background is in Aviation and Leadership. I love to feel prepared, and I would be eternally grateful if I could get some help prepping for this interview. I’ve never had a job in the Arts and I really don’t know what type of questions to expect. Anyone that does hiring or interviews, drop me any tips or sample questions. I really, really want this opportunity. Thank you for any help or resources you are able to provide.  \n\n\\-CouchPotato",

He found out that the two government officials were purchasing experts who did experiments directly at the timber manufacturer, so he invited them to drink and eat meat every day. Afterwards, the three government officials and the two purchasers he hired asked for kickbacks from the timber manufacturer. After spending three thousand taels of silver, Dust-scent was worried and said to the two officials: \"The construction site hasn't started yet, and so much money has been spent. If there is a loss, I can't afford it!\"\n\n三个政府官员笑着回答：“小兄弟！你的这个工程不一样，计料不计工。等咱到家之后，你就已经赚了300两银子的利润了。做这个工程只赚不赔！”\n\n回到家之后，尘香问公司经理：“那两个政府官员说的是真话吗？”\n\nThe two government officials smiled and replied: \"Little brother! Your project is different. It only counts materials but not labor. When we get home, you will have made a profit of 300 taels of silver. This project is profitable and not loss-making!\"\n\nAfter returning home, Dust-scent asked the company manager, “Are those two government officials telling the truth?”\n\n经理回答：“这个工程的施工已经依照成熟的施工步骤，分解成了许多具体项目。如果按照施工进度表和预算逐步实施，认真做好每一项工作，亏损的可能性很小。”\n\nThe manager replied, “The construction of this project has been broken down into many specific projects in accordance with proven construction procedures. If it is implemented step by step in accordance with the construction schedule and budget, and every job is done carefully, the possibility of loss is very small.”\n\n尘香拿出了300两银子的利润分给了两个官员，要跟他们合作：把这工程15%利润的一半分给他们，由他们两个负责采购工作。那两个官员回答：“我们不占你的便宜；你把利润的三分之一给我们就够了！”\n\n尘香回答：“我愿意分给你们一半利润！”\n\nDust-scent took out 300 taels of silver profit and divided it with two officials to cooperate with them: half of the 15% profit of this project would be divided among them, and the two of them would oversee the procurement work. The two officials replied, “We won't take advantage of you; it's enough for you to give us one-third of the profit!”\n\nDust-scent replied, “I'm willing to share half of the profits!”\n\n这两个官员私下讨论了一会儿关于如何掌握尘香犯罪的证据，来制约他。他们回来说：“我们为你在政府里办件事后，咱们的合作协议就生效了！”\n\n尘香回答：“我也想当官！”\n\nThese two officials discussed privately for a while about how to get hold of evidence of Dust-scent's crimes to restrain him. They came back and said, “After we do something for you in the government, our cooperation agreement will come into effect!”\n\nDust-scent replied, “I want to be a government official too!”\n\n几天后，两个官员来找尘香，说：“咱们县政府有三十多位官，其中只有九位是共和国的公务员。你要当公务员我们办不了。其它的县政府雇来的工作人员，也有一部分是官。如果你想当这种不是共和国政府注册的官员，我们可以帮忙。”\n\n尘香回答：“是官就行！”\n\nA few days later, two officials came to Dust-scent and said, \"Our county government has more than thirty officials, but only nine of them are civil servants of the Republic of China. We can't help you become a civil servant. Some of the other staff members hired by the county government are also officials. If you want to become an official who isn't registered with the Republic of China, we can help you.\"\n\nDust-scent replied, \"Any official will do!\"\n\n两个政府官员立刻高兴了，说：“现在档案库缺一位保管员。这个工作的优点是你若不去上班，你可以把档案库的钥匙挂在县长秘书的抽屉上。我们觉得这工作挺合适你，因为你时常要回来照顾这个工地。”\n\n尘香回答：“仓库不漏雨，我就没事。这个工作挺好，我想干，但这个工作是官吗？”\n\nThe two government officials were immediately delighted, saying, \"We're currently short a custodian for the archives. The advantage of this job is that if you're not at work, you can hang the archive key on the county prefect's secretary's drawer. We think this job is quite suitable for you, since you often need to come back to check on this construction site.\"\n\nDust-scent replied, \"As long as the warehouse doesn't leak, I'm fine. This job sounds good, I'd like to do it, but is this a government official?\"\n\n两位官员立刻回答：“这工作当然是官。是不是官你得看俸禄的高低。档案库保管员的薪水是非国家公务员的官中，薪水比较高的。如果你接受了这份工作，咱们合伙干行宫整修工程的合同立刻生效。”\n\n尘香回答：“好！我明天早晨去县政府上班！”\n\nThe two officials immediately replied, “This job is an official position. Whether it’s an official position depends on the salary. The salary of an archive custodian is relatively high among non-civil servants. If you accept this job, our contract for the joint renovation of the migration palace will take effect immediately.”\n\nDust-scent replied, “Okay! I’ll go to work at the county government tomorrow morning!”\n\n第二天早晨，尘香来到县政府报到了。那两个办理采购的公务员把他介绍给了县长的秘书：行政。行政领着尘香到档案库里给他介绍档案的编码，然后就把档案室的钥匙交给了他。尘香就自己检查档案室的屋顶，发现了三块瓦片裂了。他就自己去建材市场买了三块瓦把屋顶的漏雨处补好了。然后就坐在县衙门的门口和人唠嗑。他在打听如何制作假身份证。\n\n行政看尘香识字就主动给尘香讲解商朝的业槃制度，让他做数据录入的工作。\n\nThe next morning, Dust-scent reported to the county government. The two civil servants who handled the procurement introduced him to the prefect’s secretary: Administrative. Administrative led Dust-scent to the archives and introduced him to the coding of the archives and then handed him the key to the archives room. Dust-scent then checked the roof of the archive room himself and found three tiles cracked. He then went to the building materials market by himself and bought three tiles to patch up the leaks in the roof. Then he sat at the door of the county courthouse and chattered with someone. He was inquiring about how to make fake ID cards.\n\nSeeing that Dust-scent could read, Administrative took the initiative to explain the Shang Dynasty's Karmic Ark system to him, assigning him data entry duties.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/863f3qjhwgig1.jpg?width=2580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=86c627efa184c21adec0a8143427c897df77d849\n\n**2. 商朝的业槃制度 Karmic Ark of Shang Dynasty**\n\n插图14.7-35，和36都是商朝业槃的图示。图1-34和42都是墨西哥业槃的图示。中华文化和墨西哥文化都是基于金童和玉女这对儿双身佛（如图39，40，和41），可以通用。业是身口意的习气。槃义为螺旋上升的木船，现代人称为方舟或超渡。\n\nIllustrations 14.7-35 and 36 depict the Shang Dynasty's Karmic Ark. Figures 1-34 and 42 illustrate the Mexican Karmic Ark. Both Chinese and Mexican cultures are based on the dual-bodied Buddha pair of the Golden Boy and Jade Girl (as shown in Figures 39, 40, and 41), which are interchangeable. Karma refers to the habits of body, oral, and intent. Pan (槃) signifies a spiraling wooden vessel ascending upward, known in modern terms as an Ark or “Transcendentally Ferry.”\n\n商朝人称图2的无所有天为涅。涅字由三部分构成，水代表顺皇。土代表大禹，商地，如图23至31所示的九地。日代表玉皇大帝。他们仨是上帝三人组，是涅槃。\n\n图22是地狱，是罪孽槃，义为罪孽深重的地方。涅和孽是这个世界的两个太极。涅是最幸福的地方；孽是最不幸的地方。\n\nThe Shang Dynasty people called the \"No Objectively Have Sky\" in Figure 2 as Nie (涅). Word Nie consisted of three parts: water representing White-king Shun. Earth represents Big Yu and the Shang lands, as shown in the nine lands in Figures 23 to 31. The sun representing Turquoise White-king Great Creator. So, Nie (涅) means Godly Trinity, is Nirvana Ark.\n\nFigure 22 depicts Hell, the Sin Ark, signifying a place of profound sin. Nirvana and Hell are the two poles of this world. Nirvana is the happiest place; Hell is the most unfortunate place.\n\n墨西哥人用金童和玉女一生的全部经历来代表业槃（如图42）；并把他们俩的一生的故事分解成了20个关键法案（参见15.4.4.5 《设计太阳石历》），也就是分成了20劫。\n\n中国商朝用金童和玉女一生的全部经历来代表业槃（如图36）。他们把金童和玉女的故事分成了八个大劫（即八个大法案），每个大劫包括八劫（即八个法案）。然后他们把这64个法案命名了，称为六十四卦。\n\nThe Mexicans represented karmic ark through the entire life journey of the Golden Boy and Jade Girl (as shown in Figure 42); they divided the story of their lives into 20 key cases (see 15.4.4.5 Designing the Sunstone Calendar), which correspond to 20 catastrophes.\n\nShang Dynasty of China used the entire life journey of the Golden Boy and Jade Girl to represent the Karmic Ark (as shown in Figure 36). They divided the story of the Golden Boy and Jade Girl into eight great catastrophes (i.e., eight major law cases), each comprising eight catastrophes (i.e., eight law cases). They then named these 64 law cases, calling them the sixty-four hexagrams.\n\n这64个字被分配到了代表金童玉女的两条鱼的周围（如图36），就与一年四季联系在了一起，也就是说这64个字可以计时，也可以用来诠释地点，道德水平，和觉悟的高低等用途。\n\n商朝还把风水，和家业等信息写入了身份证的号码。风代表民风，地方风俗。水代表文化知识，即上帝造人的知识。家族信息体现了祖宗18代的信息。\n\nThese 64 characters were assigned around the two fish representing the golden boy and jade girl (as shown in Figure 36), thus connecting them with the four seasons. In other words, these 64 characters can be used to tell time, as well as to interpret locations, moral levels, and levels of enlightenment.\n\nShang Dynasty also incorporated information about feng shui (wind and water) and family karma into the identity card number. \"Feng (wind)\" represented local customs and traditions. \"Shui (water)\" represented cultural knowledge, specifically the knowledge of God's creation of humanity. Family information reflected the lineage of 18 generations of ancestors.\n\n尘香很快明白了商朝档案的秘密。档案室里的户籍和个人历史记录是根据皇历（即万年历）的原理编码的。这些编码是从以前的记录算出来的。每一个记录都会有涟漪似的扩散效应。比如一个人的出生记录会计入档案（业槃）。几年后他的数据就会进入周围49个县的孽槃。这样就没人能够造出从出生开始的假身份，因为更改涅盘的工作量大。造出一个18岁的年青人要更改周围49县，甚至多个省的业槃。这个档案的机制已经在尧帝登基时全国联网了，即已经形成了一个中华共和国大业槃。\n\nDust-scent quickly understood the secret of the Shang Dynasty archives. The household registrations and personal historical records in the archives were coded according to the principles of white-king calendar (i.e., a perpetual calendar). These codes were calculated from previous records. Each record would have a ripple-like diffusion effect. For example, a person's birth record would be entered into the archives (a local karmic ark). A few years later, his data would enter the karmic arks of the surrounding 49 counties. In this way, no one could create a false identity from birth, because altering the Karmic Arks would be too much work. Creating an 18-year-old would require altering the Karmic Arks of 49 surrounding counties, or even multiple provinces. This archive mechanism had already been networked nationwide when White-king Yao ascended her throne, forming a great Karmic Ark of the Republic of China.\n\n**3. 土地老 Earth Gods**\n\n尘香和行政混熟了，问：“我听说顺皇常四处走，忙着烧汉窑。她也常到我们那里去烧窑；但我没看见我们家那里有窑？”\n\nDust-scent, having become acquainted with Administrative (Administrative is name for the county prefect's secretary) and asked, “I hear White-king Shun is always traveling about, busy firing Han kilns. She often comes to our area to fire kilns too; but I haven't seen any kilns near our home?”\n\n行政回答：“这个窑是个抽象的概念，就是人人都有的身体。顺皇烧汉窑是说顺皇在做法。她在制造汉神。那些汉将是玉皇大帝的辅臣，名作神辅天（如图8，参见13.2 《色界》）。神辅天亦作土地老，成为汉神后，会回去他的家乡，把他家乡的人超渡成为神众天，亦作汉族人。这事儿具体的我不太懂。你可以去问问捕快林冲和路引，他们俩认识许多咱们县的法师。那些法师和女娲，娥黄，和女婴，这武汉的三大家族有联系，他们懂。”\n\nAdministrative replied, \"This kiln is an abstract concept, representing the body that everyone possesses. White-king Shun firing Han kilns means she's performing rituals (doing magics, making law). She's creating Han gods. These Han gods are Turquoise White-king Great Creator's assistants, known as God Assistant Skies (as shown in Figure 8, see 13.2 'Color Boundary'). God Assistant Sky is also called the Earth God. After becoming a Han god, he returns to his hometown and transcendently ferry hometown folks into Godly Crowds, also known as Han people. I don't know the specifics of this. You can ask the constables Before-charge and Path-leader; they know many of juristic teachers in our county. Those juristic teachers are connected to Nuwa, Beauty Yellow, and Heroine—the three great families of Wuhan—they know.\"\n\n**4. 华人的旅游胜地 Chinese Tourist Destination**\n\n行宫的整修工作开始了，就对外开放了。很多人来行宫参观。据说这座行宫从建成到现在的三千六百年期间，80%的华人至少来过一次。许多人来过多次，但就是不说。\n\nThe renovation of the migration palace began, and it was opened to the public. Many people came to visit. It is said that in the 3,600 years since the palace was built, 80% of the Chinese population have visited it at least once. Many people have visited multiple times, but they just don't say it.\n\n人们开始检查认证这座由旧木头盖成的新房还能用多少年？有人说15年，有人说10年。尘香和尘凡也参加了猜测，认为能住20年。他俩问建筑公司经理。\n\n经理回答： “我能住30年，你们哥俩能住20年，皇帝住7年。”\n\nPeople began to check and certify how long this new house made of old wood could last. Some said 15 years, others said 10 years. Dust-scent and Dust-mortal also speculated that it could last 20 years. They asked the manager of the construction company.\n\nThe manager replied: \"I can live here for 30 years, you two brothers can live here for 20 years, and the emperor can live here for 7 years.\"\n\n尘凡问：“他们只住7年，那我们用什么标准来修建这皇宫？”\n\n公司经理回答：“即便是皇帝只在这里住一个月，我们也当成他们要住100年。”\n\nDust-mortal asked: \"They only live here for 7 years, so what standard do we use to build this palace?\"\n\nThe company manager replied: \"Even if the emperor only lives here for a month, we will treat it as if they will live here for 100 years.\"\n\n**5. 行宫维修的目的 Purpose of Palace Repair**\n\n这次行宫改造的主要工程项目是，一，为了增加采光，给行宫开几个天窗，附加给各个房间装上天棚。二，为了增加房间里空气的流动性，给行宫建立通风系统。通风系统是由一幢旱烟囱及与之相连的排气通道和进气通道构成的。其中旱烟囱，又名雷峰塔，是耗工耗时的主体项目。拆除了位于雷峰塔底座的四个洗浴间之后，设计院派来了实地考察的人。\n\nThe main projects of the palace renovation this time are: first, to increase the lighting, open several skylights in the palace and install ceilings in each room; second, to increase the air flow in the rooms, build a ventilation system for the palace. The ventilation system is composed of a dry chimney and the exhaust and intake channels connected to it. Among them, the dry chimney, also known as Leifeng Pagoda, is the main project that consumes labor and time. After dismantling the four bathrooms at the base of Leifeng Pagoda, the design institute sent people to conduct on-site inspections.\n\n设计院的代表看了以前大禹留下来的地基验收报告和雷峰塔的地基现状后说；“我们认可以前的地基验收报告；但是那是五年前的竣工报告。我们有必要挖三个测试坑，看看有没有变化。然后做几个抗压测试。这些实验我们都不收钱。”建筑公司经理和政府派来的三个两位县政府官员都同意了。\n\nAfter looking at the foundation acceptance report left by Big Yu and the status of the Leifeng Pagoda's foundation, the representative of the design institute said, \"We recognize the previous foundation acceptance report, but that was the completion report five years ago. We need to dig three test pits to see if there are any changes. Then do some compression tests. We don't charge for these experiments.\" The construction company manager and the three construction supervisors sent by the government all agreed.\n\n**6. 更改雷峰塔的设计 Change the Design of Leifeng Pagoda**\n\n在做实验的几天里，尘香天天请设计院的代表喝酒吃肉。代表离开工地的这天，尘香请他喝茅台酒。设计院的代表笑着问：“有什么事？你就直说吧！若不然这茅台酒我可不敢喝。”\n\n尘香说：“我想把通风系统的进气道口向北移到院墙边。这样不但美观，还可以把进气口的房子建得长些来减少被投毒的风险。”\n\nDuring the days of the experiment, Dust-scent treated the design institute representative to alcohol and meat every day. On the day the representative left the construction site, Dust-scent treated him to Maotai alcohol. The design representative smiled and asked: \"What's the matter? Just tell me! Otherwise, I dare not drink this Maotai alcohol.\"\n\nDust-scent said: \"I want to move the air intake of the ventilation system to the north, next to the courtyard wall. This will not only look good but also allow the air intake house to be built longer to reduce the risk of poisoning.\"\n\n设计院的代表回答：“跟帝王家做买卖有个毛病，常更改设计；所以我的原设计就是像你说的那样。这样吧，下次我再来的时候，给你带来一份原设计的草图。说是草图，实际就是比设计图纸做的看起来茅草些。上面写着我的烟囱高度和通风道长度计算公式，和计算过程。你的那位经理或者你弟弟尘凡一看就懂。他们就可以用那草图作为施工的依据。雷峰塔的结构不用改。你若用你说的进气道长度，雷峰塔的原设计高度还有一米的多余。”\n\nThe design institute representative replied, \"There's a problem with doing business with the imperial family—they constantly change designs. So, my original design was exactly as you described. This is what we'll do: next time I visit, I'll bring you a sketch of the original design. Though called a sketch, it looks rougher than the final turquoiseprints. It includes my calculations for the chimney height and ventilation duct length, along with the calculation process. Your manager or your brother Dust-mortal will understand it immediately. They can use that sketch as the basis for construction. The structure of Leifeng Pagoda doesn't need to be altered. If you use the intake duct length you mentioned, the original design height of Leifeng Pagoda will still have over a meter extra.\"\n\n尘香回答：“谢谢了！那我把20两银子作为礼物送给你！”\n\n设计院的代表说：“谢谢了！那我可以把我的名字签在草图上面。我不能把我们公司的印章盖在上面。那样，你的花费就大了；我也违反了我们公司的规定。”\n\n随后，尘香和尘凡就研究了如何更改施工进度表，来实现他俩挖洞进入行宫的计划。\n\nDust-scent replied: \"Thank you! Then I will give you 20 taels of silver as a gift!\"\n\nThe representative of the design institute said: \"Thank you! Then I can sign my name on the sketch. I cannot put our company seal on it. That way, your cost will be high, and I will also violate our company's regulations.\"\n\nAfterwards, Dust-scent and Dust-mortal studied how to change the construction schedule to realize their plan to dig a hole into the Migration Palace.\n\n[返回女娲后人的目录 Return Catalog of Nuwa’s Descendants](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1r03etm/14_%E5%A5%B3%E5%A8%B2%E7%9A%84%E5%90%8E%E4%BA%BA_nuwas_descendants/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)",

He found out that the two government officials were purchasing experts who did experiments directly at the timber manufacturer, so he invited them to drink and eat meat every day. Afterwards, the three government officials and the two purchasers he hired asked for kickbacks from the timber manufacturer. After spending three thousand taels of silver, Dust-scent was worried and said to the two officials: &amp;quot;The construction site hasn&amp;#39;t started yet, and so much money has been spent. If there is a loss, I can&amp;#39;t afford it!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;三个政府官员笑着回答：“小兄弟！你的这个工程不一样，计料不计工。等咱到家之后，你就已经赚了300两银子的利润了。做这个工程只赚不赔！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;回到家之后，尘香问公司经理：“那两个政府官员说的是真话吗？”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two government officials smiled and replied: &amp;quot;Little brother! Your project is different. It only counts materials but not labor. When we get home, you will have made a profit of 300 taels of silver. This project is profitable and not loss-making!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After returning home, Dust-scent asked the company manager, “Are those two government officials telling the truth?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;经理回答：“这个工程的施工已经依照成熟的施工步骤，分解成了许多具体项目。如果按照施工进度表和预算逐步实施，认真做好每一项工作，亏损的可能性很小。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The manager replied, “The construction of this project has been broken down into many specific projects in accordance with proven construction procedures. If it is implemented step by step in accordance with the construction schedule and budget, and every job is done carefully, the possibility of loss is very small.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香拿出了300两银子的利润分给了两个官员，要跟他们合作：把这工程15%利润的一半分给他们，由他们两个负责采购工作。那两个官员回答：“我们不占你的便宜；你把利润的三分之一给我们就够了！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香回答：“我愿意分给你们一半利润！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent took out 300 taels of silver profit and divided it with two officials to cooperate with them: half of the 15% profit of this project would be divided among them, and the two of them would oversee the procurement work. The two officials replied, “We won&amp;#39;t take advantage of you; it&amp;#39;s enough for you to give us one-third of the profit!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent replied, “I&amp;#39;m willing to share half of the profits!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;这两个官员私下讨论了一会儿关于如何掌握尘香犯罪的证据，来制约他。他们回来说：“我们为你在政府里办件事后，咱们的合作协议就生效了！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香回答：“我也想当官！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These two officials discussed privately for a while about how to get hold of evidence of Dust-scent&amp;#39;s crimes to restrain him. They came back and said, “After we do something for you in the government, our cooperation agreement will come into effect!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent replied, “I want to be a government official too!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;几天后，两个官员来找尘香，说：“咱们县政府有三十多位官，其中只有九位是共和国的公务员。你要当公务员我们办不了。其它的县政府雇来的工作人员，也有一部分是官。如果你想当这种不是共和国政府注册的官员，我们可以帮忙。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香回答：“是官就行！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few days later, two officials came to Dust-scent and said, &amp;quot;Our county government has more than thirty officials, but only nine of them are civil servants of the Republic of China. We can&amp;#39;t help you become a civil servant. Some of the other staff members hired by the county government are also officials. If you want to become an official who isn&amp;#39;t registered with the Republic of China, we can help you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent replied, &amp;quot;Any official will do!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;两个政府官员立刻高兴了，说：“现在档案库缺一位保管员。这个工作的优点是你若不去上班，你可以把档案库的钥匙挂在县长秘书的抽屉上。我们觉得这工作挺合适你，因为你时常要回来照顾这个工地。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香回答：“仓库不漏雨，我就没事。这个工作挺好，我想干，但这个工作是官吗？”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two government officials were immediately delighted, saying, &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re currently short a custodian for the archives. The advantage of this job is that if you&amp;#39;re not at work, you can hang the archive key on the county prefect&amp;#39;s secretary&amp;#39;s drawer. We think this job is quite suitable for you, since you often need to come back to check on this construction site.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent replied, &amp;quot;As long as the warehouse doesn&amp;#39;t leak, I&amp;#39;m fine. This job sounds good, I&amp;#39;d like to do it, but is this a government official?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;两位官员立刻回答：“这工作当然是官。是不是官你得看俸禄的高低。档案库保管员的薪水是非国家公务员的官中，薪水比较高的。如果你接受了这份工作，咱们合伙干行宫整修工程的合同立刻生效。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香回答：“好！我明天早晨去县政府上班！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two officials immediately replied, “This job is an official position. Whether it’s an official position depends on the salary. The salary of an archive custodian is relatively high among non-civil servants. If you accept this job, our contract for the joint renovation of the migration palace will take effect immediately.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent replied, “Okay! I’ll go to work at the county government tomorrow morning!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;第二天早晨，尘香来到县政府报到了。那两个办理采购的公务员把他介绍给了县长的秘书：行政。行政领着尘香到档案库里给他介绍档案的编码，然后就把档案室的钥匙交给了他。尘香就自己检查档案室的屋顶，发现了三块瓦片裂了。他就自己去建材市场买了三块瓦把屋顶的漏雨处补好了。然后就坐在县衙门的门口和人唠嗑。他在打听如何制作假身份证。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;行政看尘香识字就主动给尘香讲解商朝的业槃制度，让他做数据录入的工作。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Dust-scent reported to the county government. The two civil servants who handled the procurement introduced him to the prefect’s secretary: Administrative. Administrative led Dust-scent to the archives and introduced him to the coding of the archives and then handed him the key to the archives room. Dust-scent then checked the roof of the archive room himself and found three tiles cracked. He then went to the building materials market by himself and bought three tiles to patch up the leaks in the roof. Then he sat at the door of the county courthouse and chattered with someone. He was inquiring about how to make fake ID cards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing that Dust-scent could read, Administrative took the initiative to explain the Shang Dynasty&amp;#39;s Karmic Ark system to him, assigning him data entry duties.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/863f3qjhwgig1.jpg?width=2580&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=86c627efa184c21adec0a8143427c897df77d849\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/863f3qjhwgig1.jpg?width=2580&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=86c627efa184c21adec0a8143427c897df77d849&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. 商朝的业槃制度 Karmic Ark of Shang Dynasty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;插图14.7-35，和36都是商朝业槃的图示。图1-34和42都是墨西哥业槃的图示。中华文化和墨西哥文化都是基于金童和玉女这对儿双身佛（如图39，40，和41），可以通用。业是身口意的习气。槃义为螺旋上升的木船，现代人称为方舟或超渡。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Illustrations 14.7-35 and 36 depict the Shang Dynasty&amp;#39;s Karmic Ark. Figures 1-34 and 42 illustrate the Mexican Karmic Ark. Both Chinese and Mexican cultures are based on the dual-bodied Buddha pair of the Golden Boy and Jade Girl (as shown in Figures 39, 40, and 41), which are interchangeable. Karma refers to the habits of body, oral, and intent. Pan (槃) signifies a spiraling wooden vessel ascending upward, known in modern terms as an Ark or “Transcendentally Ferry.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;商朝人称图2的无所有天为涅。涅字由三部分构成，水代表顺皇。土代表大禹，商地，如图23至31所示的九地。日代表玉皇大帝。他们仨是上帝三人组，是涅槃。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;图22是地狱，是罪孽槃，义为罪孽深重的地方。涅和孽是这个世界的两个太极。涅是最幸福的地方；孽是最不幸的地方。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Shang Dynasty people called the &amp;quot;No Objectively Have Sky&amp;quot; in Figure 2 as Nie (涅). Word Nie consisted of three parts: water representing White-king Shun. Earth represents Big Yu and the Shang lands, as shown in the nine lands in Figures 23 to 31. The sun representing Turquoise White-king Great Creator. So, Nie (涅) means Godly Trinity, is Nirvana Ark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Figure 22 depicts Hell, the Sin Ark, signifying a place of profound sin. Nirvana and Hell are the two poles of this world. Nirvana is the happiest place; Hell is the most unfortunate place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;墨西哥人用金童和玉女一生的全部经历来代表业槃（如图42）；并把他们俩的一生的故事分解成了20个关键法案（参见15.4.4.5 《设计太阳石历》），也就是分成了20劫。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;中国商朝用金童和玉女一生的全部经历来代表业槃（如图36）。他们把金童和玉女的故事分成了八个大劫（即八个大法案），每个大劫包括八劫（即八个法案）。然后他们把这64个法案命名了，称为六十四卦。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Mexicans represented karmic ark through the entire life journey of the Golden Boy and Jade Girl (as shown in Figure 42); they divided the story of their lives into 20 key cases (see 15.4.4.5 Designing the Sunstone Calendar), which correspond to 20 catastrophes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shang Dynasty of China used the entire life journey of the Golden Boy and Jade Girl to represent the Karmic Ark (as shown in Figure 36). They divided the story of the Golden Boy and Jade Girl into eight great catastrophes (i.e., eight major law cases), each comprising eight catastrophes (i.e., eight law cases). They then named these 64 law cases, calling them the sixty-four hexagrams.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;这64个字被分配到了代表金童玉女的两条鱼的周围（如图36），就与一年四季联系在了一起，也就是说这64个字可以计时，也可以用来诠释地点，道德水平，和觉悟的高低等用途。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;商朝还把风水，和家业等信息写入了身份证的号码。风代表民风，地方风俗。水代表文化知识，即上帝造人的知识。家族信息体现了祖宗18代的信息。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These 64 characters were assigned around the two fish representing the golden boy and jade girl (as shown in Figure 36), thus connecting them with the four seasons. In other words, these 64 characters can be used to tell time, as well as to interpret locations, moral levels, and levels of enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shang Dynasty also incorporated information about feng shui (wind and water) and family karma into the identity card number. &amp;quot;Feng (wind)&amp;quot; represented local customs and traditions. &amp;quot;Shui (water)&amp;quot; represented cultural knowledge, specifically the knowledge of God&amp;#39;s creation of humanity. Family information reflected the lineage of 18 generations of ancestors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香很快明白了商朝档案的秘密。档案室里的户籍和个人历史记录是根据皇历（即万年历）的原理编码的。这些编码是从以前的记录算出来的。每一个记录都会有涟漪似的扩散效应。比如一个人的出生记录会计入档案（业槃）。几年后他的数据就会进入周围49个县的孽槃。这样就没人能够造出从出生开始的假身份，因为更改涅盘的工作量大。造出一个18岁的年青人要更改周围49县，甚至多个省的业槃。这个档案的机制已经在尧帝登基时全国联网了，即已经形成了一个中华共和国大业槃。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent quickly understood the secret of the Shang Dynasty archives. The household registrations and personal historical records in the archives were coded according to the principles of white-king calendar (i.e., a perpetual calendar). These codes were calculated from previous records. Each record would have a ripple-like diffusion effect. For example, a person&amp;#39;s birth record would be entered into the archives (a local karmic ark). A few years later, his data would enter the karmic arks of the surrounding 49 counties. In this way, no one could create a false identity from birth, because altering the Karmic Arks would be too much work. Creating an 18-year-old would require altering the Karmic Arks of 49 surrounding counties, or even multiple provinces. This archive mechanism had already been networked nationwide when White-king Yao ascended her throne, forming a great Karmic Ark of the Republic of China.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. 土地老 Earth Gods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香和行政混熟了，问：“我听说顺皇常四处走，忙着烧汉窑。她也常到我们那里去烧窑；但我没看见我们家那里有窑？”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent, having become acquainted with Administrative (Administrative is name for the county prefect&amp;#39;s secretary) and asked, “I hear White-king Shun is always traveling about, busy firing Han kilns. She often comes to our area to fire kilns too; but I haven&amp;#39;t seen any kilns near our home?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;行政回答：“这个窑是个抽象的概念，就是人人都有的身体。顺皇烧汉窑是说顺皇在做法。她在制造汉神。那些汉将是玉皇大帝的辅臣，名作神辅天（如图8，参见13.2 《色界》）。神辅天亦作土地老，成为汉神后，会回去他的家乡，把他家乡的人超渡成为神众天，亦作汉族人。这事儿具体的我不太懂。你可以去问问捕快林冲和路引，他们俩认识许多咱们县的法师。那些法师和女娲，娥黄，和女婴，这武汉的三大家族有联系，他们懂。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Administrative replied, &amp;quot;This kiln is an abstract concept, representing the body that everyone possesses. White-king Shun firing Han kilns means she&amp;#39;s performing rituals (doing magics, making law). She&amp;#39;s creating Han gods. These Han gods are Turquoise White-king Great Creator&amp;#39;s assistants, known as God Assistant Skies (as shown in Figure 8, see 13.2 &amp;#39;Color Boundary&amp;#39;). God Assistant Sky is also called the Earth God. After becoming a Han god, he returns to his hometown and transcendently ferry hometown folks into Godly Crowds, also known as Han people. I don&amp;#39;t know the specifics of this. You can ask the constables Before-charge and Path-leader; they know many of juristic teachers in our county. Those juristic teachers are connected to Nuwa, Beauty Yellow, and Heroine—the three great families of Wuhan—they know.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. 华人的旅游胜地 Chinese Tourist Destination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;行宫的整修工作开始了，就对外开放了。很多人来行宫参观。据说这座行宫从建成到现在的三千六百年期间，80%的华人至少来过一次。许多人来过多次，但就是不说。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The renovation of the migration palace began, and it was opened to the public. Many people came to visit. It is said that in the 3,600 years since the palace was built, 80% of the Chinese population have visited it at least once. Many people have visited multiple times, but they just don&amp;#39;t say it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;人们开始检查认证这座由旧木头盖成的新房还能用多少年？有人说15年，有人说10年。尘香和尘凡也参加了猜测，认为能住20年。他俩问建筑公司经理。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;经理回答： “我能住30年，你们哥俩能住20年，皇帝住7年。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People began to check and certify how long this new house made of old wood could last. Some said 15 years, others said 10 years. Dust-scent and Dust-mortal also speculated that it could last 20 years. They asked the manager of the construction company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The manager replied: &amp;quot;I can live here for 30 years, you two brothers can live here for 20 years, and the emperor can live here for 7 years.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘凡问：“他们只住7年，那我们用什么标准来修建这皇宫？”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;公司经理回答：“即便是皇帝只在这里住一个月，我们也当成他们要住100年。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-mortal asked: &amp;quot;They only live here for 7 years, so what standard do we use to build this palace?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The company manager replied: &amp;quot;Even if the emperor only lives here for a month, we will treat it as if they will live here for 100 years.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. 行宫维修的目的 Purpose of Palace Repair&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;这次行宫改造的主要工程项目是，一，为了增加采光，给行宫开几个天窗，附加给各个房间装上天棚。二，为了增加房间里空气的流动性，给行宫建立通风系统。通风系统是由一幢旱烟囱及与之相连的排气通道和进气通道构成的。其中旱烟囱，又名雷峰塔，是耗工耗时的主体项目。拆除了位于雷峰塔底座的四个洗浴间之后，设计院派来了实地考察的人。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main projects of the palace renovation this time are: first, to increase the lighting, open several skylights in the palace and install ceilings in each room; second, to increase the air flow in the rooms, build a ventilation system for the palace. The ventilation system is composed of a dry chimney and the exhaust and intake channels connected to it. Among them, the dry chimney, also known as Leifeng Pagoda, is the main project that consumes labor and time. After dismantling the four bathrooms at the base of Leifeng Pagoda, the design institute sent people to conduct on-site inspections.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;设计院的代表看了以前大禹留下来的地基验收报告和雷峰塔的地基现状后说；“我们认可以前的地基验收报告；但是那是五年前的竣工报告。我们有必要挖三个测试坑，看看有没有变化。然后做几个抗压测试。这些实验我们都不收钱。”建筑公司经理和政府派来的三个两位县政府官员都同意了。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After looking at the foundation acceptance report left by Big Yu and the status of the Leifeng Pagoda&amp;#39;s foundation, the representative of the design institute said, &amp;quot;We recognize the previous foundation acceptance report, but that was the completion report five years ago. We need to dig three test pits to see if there are any changes. Then do some compression tests. We don&amp;#39;t charge for these experiments.&amp;quot; The construction company manager and the three construction supervisors sent by the government all agreed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. 更改雷峰塔的设计 Change the Design of Leifeng Pagoda&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;在做实验的几天里，尘香天天请设计院的代表喝酒吃肉。代表离开工地的这天，尘香请他喝茅台酒。设计院的代表笑着问：“有什么事？你就直说吧！若不然这茅台酒我可不敢喝。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香说：“我想把通风系统的进气道口向北移到院墙边。这样不但美观，还可以把进气口的房子建得长些来减少被投毒的风险。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;During the days of the experiment, Dust-scent treated the design institute representative to alcohol and meat every day. On the day the representative left the construction site, Dust-scent treated him to Maotai alcohol. The design representative smiled and asked: &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the matter? Just tell me! Otherwise, I dare not drink this Maotai alcohol.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent said: &amp;quot;I want to move the air intake of the ventilation system to the north, next to the courtyard wall. This will not only look good but also allow the air intake house to be built longer to reduce the risk of poisoning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;设计院的代表回答：“跟帝王家做买卖有个毛病，常更改设计；所以我的原设计就是像你说的那样。这样吧，下次我再来的时候，给你带来一份原设计的草图。说是草图，实际就是比设计图纸做的看起来茅草些。上面写着我的烟囱高度和通风道长度计算公式，和计算过程。你的那位经理或者你弟弟尘凡一看就懂。他们就可以用那草图作为施工的依据。雷峰塔的结构不用改。你若用你说的进气道长度，雷峰塔的原设计高度还有一米的多余。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The design institute representative replied, &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s a problem with doing business with the imperial family—they constantly change designs. So, my original design was exactly as you described. This is what we&amp;#39;ll do: next time I visit, I&amp;#39;ll bring you a sketch of the original design. Though called a sketch, it looks rougher than the final turquoiseprints. It includes my calculations for the chimney height and ventilation duct length, along with the calculation process. Your manager or your brother Dust-mortal will understand it immediately. They can use that sketch as the basis for construction. The structure of Leifeng Pagoda doesn&amp;#39;t need to be altered. If you use the intake duct length you mentioned, the original design height of Leifeng Pagoda will still have over a meter extra.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香回答：“谢谢了！那我把20两银子作为礼物送给你！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;设计院的代表说：“谢谢了！那我可以把我的名字签在草图上面。我不能把我们公司的印章盖在上面。那样，你的花费就大了；我也违反了我们公司的规定。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;随后，尘香和尘凡就研究了如何更改施工进度表，来实现他俩挖洞进入行宫的计划。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent replied: &amp;quot;Thank you! Then I will give you 20 taels of silver as a gift!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The representative of the design institute said: &amp;quot;Thank you! Then I can sign my name on the sketch. I cannot put our company seal on it. That way, your cost will be high, and I will also violate our company&amp;#39;s regulations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, Dust-scent and Dust-mortal studied how to change the construction schedule to realize their plan to dig a hole into the Migration Palace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1r03etm/14_%E5%A5%B3%E5%A8%B2%E7%9A%84%E5%90%8E%E4%BA%BA_nuwas_descendants/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button\"&gt;返回女娲后人的目录 Return Catalog of Nuwa’s Descendants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

This time, Big Yu accompanied her. Dust-scent and Dust-mortal accompanied Big Yu and Emperor Shun on another round of visiting relatives. Neither Big Yu nor the two brothers liked walking beside Emperor Shun, who was always surrounded by her Hans (adult men).\n\n又一次走到了那个名为断桥的桥边房子。一位汉推开门对里面喊：“女人来了！” 里面有人答应着：“女娲来了！”顺皇进到屋子里了。大禹和这哥俩不想进去了，坐在了路边唠嗑，等着他们出来。忽然一个汉子过来招呼他们仨说： “魃！女人让你们进去！人家要看女魃！” 大禹惊惶地拉着他们俩跑进了屋子！\n\nOnce more, they arrived at the house by the bridge called Broken Bridge. A Han man pushed open the door and called inside: “Woman is here!” Someone inside answered: “Nüwa has arrived!” Emperor entered the room. Big Yu and the two brothers didn't want to go in. They sat by the roadside chatting, waiting for them to come out. Suddenly, a Han man approached them and said: \"Bā (i.e., drought)! Woman wants you to come in! People want to see “Woman Bā (i.e., drought)!\" Startled, Yu hurriedly pulled the other two into the house!\n\n随后尘香和尘凡领着大禹参观他们的工地。看后，大禹开始给他们俩讲如何建立建筑公司，还列出了一份详细的清单，比如所推荐的公司经理的名字，设计公司，预算公司，和几个施工队。并对这哥俩说：“要做一项工程，你得先花两千两银子，然后依照施工进度表和预算逐步实施！”\n\nDust-scent and Dust-mortal showed Big Yu around their construction sites. After the visit, Big Yu began to tell them how to set up a construction company and listed a detailed list, such as the name of the recommended company manager, the design company, the budget company, and several construction teams. He told the brothers that to do a project, you must spend two thousand taels of silver first, and then implement it step by step according to the construction schedule and budget!\n\n尘香和尘凡开始数银子，还剩下两千三百两。\n\n这天晚上，这哥俩决定去行宫看看大禹。卫兵不让进，回答： “这里没有叫大禹叔叔的。”\n\nDust-scent and Dust-mortal began to count the silver, and there were still two thousand three hundred taels left.\n\nThat night, the brothers decided to go to the palace to see Uncle Big Yu, but the guards refused to let them in and replied, “No one here calls Uncle Big Yu.”\n\n**2.**\n\n这时大禹出来了，领着他们俩迅速地走到了院子一端，他自己的房间。进屋后，尘香和尘凡惊呆了：屋子里就只有一张床，别的什么都没有！这哥俩看完四壁看屋顶：没有天棚！\n\n尘凡注意到了大禹的后背在流血。他好奇地捅了一下流血的地方，大禹 “啊”地叫了一声！尘凡闻了闻，认为是人血。\n\nAt that moment Big Yu came out and led them quickly to his own room at one end of the courtyard. When they entered the room, Dust-scent and Dust-mortal were stunned: there was only a bed in the room, nothing else! The two brothers looked at the four walls and the roof: there was no canopy!\n\nDust-mortal noticed blood flowing from Big Yu's back. Curious, he poked the bleeding spot, causing Yu to cry out in pain! Dust-mortal sniffed the blood and concluded it was human blood.\n\n大禹似乎懂得了他俩的意思，说：“这座行宫是我五年前督建的，还没有全部竣工。那时建的时候就有设计缺陷。开间大，隔间多，采光和通风不好。我已经考虑多年了，可以这么改进。大禹就在地上画如何建立通风系统和开天窗。又补充说：“你们俩可别说这是我的主意，否则你妈不会把这项工程交给你俩。”\n\nBig Yu seemed to understand what they meant and said, “I supervised the construction of this palace five years ago, and it is not yet fully completed. There were design flaws when it was built. The openings are large and there are many compartments, so the lighting and ventilation are not good. I have been thinking for years that it could be improved in this way. Big Yu then drew on the ground how to set up the ventilation system and open the skylight. And added, “You two can't say that this was my idea, otherwise your mom wouldn't have given this project to you two.”\n\n**3.**\n\n很快，卫兵来招呼尘香和尘凡说：“顺皇听说你们俩来了，要见你们俩。”\n\n在去见顺皇的路上，尘香对尘凡说：“一定要把这项工程搞到手。你一见到那个女人，就抱住她不放手！”\n\nSoon, the guards came to greet Dust-scent and Dust-mortal said, “Emperor Shun has heard that you two are here and wants to see you both.”\n\nOn the way to see Emperor Shun, Dust-scent said to Dust-mortal: \"We must get this project. As soon as you see that woman, hug her and don't let go!\"\n\n尘凡很尊敬哥哥，见到顺皇后，就扑到了她的怀里，抱住不放。顺皇惊讶地叨咕：“你们哥俩今天这是怎么了，上次离开没多久，这次就来了。说着她搂着尘凡躺到了床上。尘香也躺到了顺皇的旁边。\n\n无意中，尘香看到了屋顶，他站了起来向上看，在屋子里走了一圈。顺皇说：“别看了，没天棚！”\n\nDust-mortal respected his brother very much. When he saw Emperor Shun, he threw himself into her arms and hugged her. Emperor Shun muttered in surprise: \"What happened to you two brothers today? I left not long ago, and I’m here this time.\" As she said that, she hugged Dust-mortal and lay on the bed. Dust-scent also lay next to Emperor Shun.\n\nInadvertently, Dust-scent saw the roof. He stood up and looked up and walked around the room. Emperor Shun said: \"Don't look anymore, there is no ceiling!\"\n\n尘香惊讶地说：“没天棚！这屋子里怎么还有发霉的味儿！通风不好！” 说着，他又躺回了顺皇的身边。娘儿三个聊了几句后，尘香忽然高兴了，站起来走到了屋地的中央说：“妈！我现在有建筑施工公司了！我给你安个天棚！”\n\nDust-scent said in surprise: \"There is no ceiling! Why is there a musty smell in this room! The ventilation is not good!\" As he said that, he lay back next to Emperor Shun. After the mother and sons chatted for a few words, Dust-scent suddenly became happy, stood up and walked to the center of the room and said: \"Mom! I have a construction company now! I will install a ceiling for you!\"\n\n顺皇高兴地回答：“是啊！你一来这里就开了家建筑施工公司，做了几个工程了？”\n\n尘香回答：“已经完成了两个，还有一个正在进行！”\n\n顺皇好奇地问：“赚了多少钱了？”\n\n尘香羞涩地回答：“赔了三十两银子！”\n\nEmperor Shun replied happily, “Yes! You opened a construction company as soon as you came here, how many projects have you done?”\n\nDust-scent replied, “Two have been completed, and one is in progress!”\n\nEmperor Shun asked curiously, “How much money have you made?”\n\nDust-scent shyly replied, “Lost thirty taels of silver!”\n\n顺皇高兴地说：“这么成功！我爸爸，你们的外公玉皇大帝，第一年做金华火腿生意，把一万两本钱赔得一两银子没剩。你真的才赔30两？”\n\n尘香无可奈何地回答：“我撒谎了；我们已经赔了300两银子了！”\n\nEmperor Shun said happily, \"Such a success! My father, your grandfather, Turquoise White-king Great Creator, lost all his 10,000 taels of capital in the first year of his Jinhua ham business. Did you only lose 30 taels?\"\n\nDust-scent replied hopelessly, “I lied; we've already lost 300 taels of silver!”\n\n顺皇说：“我知道300两银子也是谎话，这次就算了。如果你敢再对我撒谎，我把你的屁股打得半个月坐不了凳子。” 说着，她抱紧了尘凡的头，嗯嗯地亲了几下。她又说：“承揽皇家的工程，你得先去县政府登记，做资格审查。过一段时间，我把这项工程的招标合同发到县政府。”\n\nEmperor Shun said, \"I know that 300 taels of silver is also a lie, so let's forget it this time. If you dare to lie to me again, I'll beat your ass so hard that you can't sit on a stool for half a month.\" With that, she hugged Dust-mortal's head tightly and mummed and kissed him a few times. She added, \"To undertake the Royal's project, you have to go to the county government to register and do a qualification check first. After some time, I will send the bidding contract for this project to the county government.\"\n\n这时，有汉子进来说：“汉来伺候您了！”\n\n顺皇对尘香和尘凡说：“那你们俩就回家好好准备吧！”\n\nAt this time, a Han came in and said: \"Han is here to serve you!\"\n\nEmperor Shun said to Dust-scent and Dust-mortal: \"Then you two go home and prepare well!\"\n\n**4.**\n\n这哥俩被送出行宫后，尘凡说：“哥哥！我才知道，你真是个演戏的天才！”\n\n尘香回答：“我看你一直紧紧地抱着那个女人！”\n\nAfter these two brothers were sent out of the palace, Dust-scent said, “Brother! I just realized that you are really a genius at acting!”\n\nDust-scent replied, “I saw you holding that woman tightly all the time!”\n\n尘凡说：“你让我一直抱着她！我讨厌她，怕她看出来，所以我一直没敢抬头！奇怪了，她知道你撒谎后，还高兴了，抱紧了我，亲我的头发！”\n\n尘香说：“她发现我长大了，谈话有策略了，当然高兴。走，咱俩回去找棵树上去看看！”\n\nDust-mortal said, “You told me to hold her all the time! I hated her and was afraid she'd see it, so I never dared to look up! It's weird, she got happy when she realized you were lying, hugged me tight, even kissed my hair!”\n\nDust-scent said, “Of course she was happy when she found out I'd grown up and the conversation was strategic. Come on, let's go back and find a tree to check it out!”\n\n这哥俩溜到了行宫的院墙旁边，在树上向院子里面看。行宫里除了大禹的房间都是灯火通明。一些汉子和士兵在排队进入顺皇的寝宫，不断地有人出来，又有人进去。\n\n哥俩看了很长时间，没琢磨出来任何结论。他们回家后，又出来爬上树，继续看。直到午夜，他俩才看见汉子和士兵们陆续回到了各自的房间，熄灭了灯。\n\n这哥俩怎么也没琢磨出来那些人进入顺皇的寝宫去干什么！\n\nThe two brothers slipped next to the courtyard wall of the palace and looked inside the courtyard from a tree. The palace was brightly lit except for Uncle Big Yu's room. Some Hans and soldiers were lining up to enter Emperor Shun's bedroom, and people were constantly coming out and going in.\n\nThe two brothers watched for a long time without working out any conclusions. They went home, came out and climbed the tree again, and continued to watch. It wasn't until midnight that the two of them saw the Hans and the soldiers return to their rooms one after another and put out their lights.\n\nThe two brothers couldn't figure out what those people had gone into Emperor Shun's bedroom to do!\n\n**5.**\n\n第二天早晨，卫兵来招呼尘香和尘凡为大禹送行。顺皇告诉他们大禹病了，需要送回武汉疗养。他俩看着大禹被两个士兵搀扶着，上了马车。顺皇过去送行，却拉住了马车夫的手，亲密地交谈了很长时间。\n\nThe next morning, the guards come to summon Dust-scent and Dust-mortal to see Big Yu off. Emperor Shun told them that Uncle Big Yu was sick and needed to be sent back to Wuhan to recuperate. They watched as Big Yu was assisted by two soldiers and got into a carriage. Emperor Shun goes over to see him off but takes the carriage driver's hand and talks intimately for a long time.\n\n回家的路上，尘凡被气哭了，说：“我看这个黑心的女人是纯心要害死大禹叔叔。咱爸爸牛郎就是这么被她整死的！”\n\n尘香问：“你为什么这么想？”\n\nOn the way home, Dust-mortal was enraged and cried, saying, “I think this black-hearted woman is purely trying to kill Uncle Big Yu. This is how our father, Cowboy, was screwed to death by her!”\n\nDust-scent asked, “Why do you think so?”\n\n尘凡回答：“昨天，咱俩去他屋的时候，他刚被鞭刑过，伤口流出的血都从衣服上渗出来了。我还以为我看错了，就在他的伤口上用手指捅了一下。他疼得 ‘啊’ 一声，伤口又流血了。大禹叔叔的床上是空的，没有被子，天这么冷，所以他被冻感冒了。我对天发誓，这个仇我一定要报！”\n\nDust-mortal replied, “Yesterday, when we went to his house, he had just been whipped, and the blood from his wounds was oozing out of his clothes. I thought I was mistaken, so I stabbed my finger in his wound. He let out an 'ah' in pain, and the wound bled again. Uncle Big Yu's bed was empty, there was no blanket, and it was so cold, so he caught a cold. I swear to Sky that I will avenge this!”\n\n尘香说：“你可不要胡乱行动！大禹叔叔是圣人，是玉皇大帝给那个女人造的丈夫。目前他不会有生命危险！你答应过我：20岁开始造刀，22岁才开始复仇。”\n\n尘凡说：“我知道，我保证现在不会动手；我不会破坏你的计划的。”\n\nDust-scent said, “Don't act recklessly! Uncle Big Yu is a sage, the husband made by Turquoise White-King Great Creator for that woman. At present, his life will not be in danger! You promised me: you'll start making sword at 20 years old, and you won't start taking revenge until you're 22.”\n\nDust Mortal replied, “I know, and I promise I won't do anything now; I won't ruin your plans.”\n\n尘香说：“我按照大禹叔叔说的，去找那个人来当咱们建筑公司的经理，得三天后才能回来。然后由他来负责组织投标和整修行宫的工程。你若有机会，再进行宫看看，数数行宫里面有多少个男人，多少个女人。每天晚上爬到树上数数有多少人进入那个女人的卧室，记录下来。如果我回来了，你不在，我就去替换你。”\n\nDust-scent said, \"I went to find that person to be the manager of our construction company, as Uncle Big Yu said, and will have to come back in three days. Then he will be responsible for organizing the bidding and refurbishing the palace. If you have a chance, go back to the palace and count the number of men and women in the palace. Climb up a tree every night and count how many men enter that woman's bedroom and record it. If I come back and you are not here, I will go and replace you.\"\n\n尘凡问：“数那个人数有什么用？”\n\n尘香回答：“我们有可能从每晚进入她卧室的人数发现些什么！”\n\nDust-mortal asked, “What's the point of counting that number of people?”\n\nDust-scent replied, “We could possibly discover something from the number of people who enter her bedroom each night!”\n\n**6.**\n\n怎么顺皇打大禹这么狠？这不合常理！《中华法典》中说这是顺皇在做法。一天，她忽然有了这个想法，就派人去把大禹接来了。女婴担心他们俩的关系紧张，怕闹出事故来，就跟了过来。顺皇就说出要激发尘香和尘凡内心的仇恨的做法。他们俩自幼崇拜大禹，如果大禹挨欺负了，这哥俩肯定会有救大禹的愿望，那样他们俩就成为了有用之人。顺皇说完，笑着问大禹：“你看行吗？”\n\nWhy did Emperor Shun beat Yu so cruelly? This doesn't make sense! The \\*Chinese Codex\\* says this was Emperor Shun performing “Making Law” (i.e., a purposeful doing). One day, she suddenly had this idea and sent someone to bring Yu to her. Heroine, worried about the tension between the two and fearing an accident, came along. Empress Shun then explained her plan to incite hatred in Dust-scent and Dust-mortal's hearts. The two brothers had admired Yu since childhood, and if Yu were bullied, they would surely want to save him, that way, they would both become useful people. After Emperor Shun finished speaking, she smiled and asked Yu, \"What do you think?\"\n\n大禹也笑了，回答：“我觉着这个想法挺好！”\n\n女婴看他们俩都笑了，就没反对。\n\n大禹说：“海南的记录里有：尘凡是个天生的猎人。要做，就必须是真的，把我的后背打出血。”\n\nBig Yu laughed and replied, \"I think this is a great idea!\"\n\nSeeing that they were both laughing, Heroine didn't object.\n\nBig Yu said, \"The records from Hainan say: Dust-mortal is a born hunter. If you're going to do it, it has to be real—make my back bleed.\"\n\n前文，当他们看见尘香和尘凡来了，就开始准备。执行鞭刑的将军就开始打大禹。一连打了几鞭子，大禹疼的咬牙挺着，可是他的后背没出血。女婴被气得一把推开了那位将军，夺过了鞭子，啪啪两鞭子打在了同一个地方，鲜血立刻流出来了。\n\nEarlier, when they saw Dust-scent and Dust-mortal arrive, they began preparations. The general who was to carry out the whipping began to beat Big Yu. Several lashes were delivered in succession, and Big Yu gritted his teeth and endured the pain, but his back did not bleed.

This time, Big Yu accompanied her. Dust-scent and Dust-mortal accompanied Big Yu and Emperor Shun on another round of visiting relatives. Neither Big Yu nor the two brothers liked walking beside Emperor Shun, who was always surrounded by her Hans (adult men).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;又一次走到了那个名为断桥的桥边房子。一位汉推开门对里面喊：“女人来了！” 里面有人答应着：“女娲来了！”顺皇进到屋子里了。大禹和这哥俩不想进去了，坐在了路边唠嗑，等着他们出来。忽然一个汉子过来招呼他们仨说： “魃！女人让你们进去！人家要看女魃！” 大禹惊惶地拉着他们俩跑进了屋子！&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once more, they arrived at the house by the bridge called Broken Bridge. A Han man pushed open the door and called inside: “Woman is here!” Someone inside answered: “Nüwa has arrived!” Emperor entered the room. Big Yu and the two brothers didn&amp;#39;t want to go in. They sat by the roadside chatting, waiting for them to come out. Suddenly, a Han man approached them and said: &amp;quot;Bā (i.e., drought)! Woman wants you to come in! People want to see “Woman Bā (i.e., drought)!&amp;quot; Startled, Yu hurriedly pulled the other two into the house!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;随后尘香和尘凡领着大禹参观他们的工地。看后，大禹开始给他们俩讲如何建立建筑公司，还列出了一份详细的清单，比如所推荐的公司经理的名字，设计公司，预算公司，和几个施工队。并对这哥俩说：“要做一项工程，你得先花两千两银子，然后依照施工进度表和预算逐步实施！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent and Dust-mortal showed Big Yu around their construction sites. After the visit, Big Yu began to tell them how to set up a construction company and listed a detailed list, such as the name of the recommended company manager, the design company, the budget company, and several construction teams. He told the brothers that to do a project, you must spend two thousand taels of silver first, and then implement it step by step according to the construction schedule and budget!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香和尘凡开始数银子，还剩下两千三百两。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;这天晚上，这哥俩决定去行宫看看大禹。卫兵不让进，回答： “这里没有叫大禹叔叔的。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent and Dust-mortal began to count the silver, and there were still two thousand three hundred taels left.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night, the brothers decided to go to the palace to see Uncle Big Yu, but the guards refused to let them in and replied, “No one here calls Uncle Big Yu.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;这时大禹出来了，领着他们俩迅速地走到了院子一端，他自己的房间。进屋后，尘香和尘凡惊呆了：屋子里就只有一张床，别的什么都没有！这哥俩看完四壁看屋顶：没有天棚！&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘凡注意到了大禹的后背在流血。他好奇地捅了一下流血的地方，大禹 “啊”地叫了一声！尘凡闻了闻，认为是人血。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At that moment Big Yu came out and led them quickly to his own room at one end of the courtyard. When they entered the room, Dust-scent and Dust-mortal were stunned: there was only a bed in the room, nothing else! The two brothers looked at the four walls and the roof: there was no canopy!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-mortal noticed blood flowing from Big Yu&amp;#39;s back. Curious, he poked the bleeding spot, causing Yu to cry out in pain! Dust-mortal sniffed the blood and concluded it was human blood.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;大禹似乎懂得了他俩的意思，说：“这座行宫是我五年前督建的，还没有全部竣工。那时建的时候就有设计缺陷。开间大，隔间多，采光和通风不好。我已经考虑多年了，可以这么改进。大禹就在地上画如何建立通风系统和开天窗。又补充说：“你们俩可别说这是我的主意，否则你妈不会把这项工程交给你俩。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big Yu seemed to understand what they meant and said, “I supervised the construction of this palace five years ago, and it is not yet fully completed. There were design flaws when it was built. The openings are large and there are many compartments, so the lighting and ventilation are not good. I have been thinking for years that it could be improved in this way. Big Yu then drew on the ground how to set up the ventilation system and open the skylight. And added, “You two can&amp;#39;t say that this was my idea, otherwise your mom wouldn&amp;#39;t have given this project to you two.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;很快，卫兵来招呼尘香和尘凡说：“顺皇听说你们俩来了，要见你们俩。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;在去见顺皇的路上，尘香对尘凡说：“一定要把这项工程搞到手。你一见到那个女人，就抱住她不放手！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soon, the guards came to greet Dust-scent and Dust-mortal said, “Emperor Shun has heard that you two are here and wants to see you both.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the way to see Emperor Shun, Dust-scent said to Dust-mortal: &amp;quot;We must get this project. As soon as you see that woman, hug her and don&amp;#39;t let go!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘凡很尊敬哥哥，见到顺皇后，就扑到了她的怀里，抱住不放。顺皇惊讶地叨咕：“你们哥俩今天这是怎么了，上次离开没多久，这次就来了。说着她搂着尘凡躺到了床上。尘香也躺到了顺皇的旁边。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;无意中，尘香看到了屋顶，他站了起来向上看，在屋子里走了一圈。顺皇说：“别看了，没天棚！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-mortal respected his brother very much. When he saw Emperor Shun, he threw himself into her arms and hugged her. Emperor Shun muttered in surprise: &amp;quot;What happened to you two brothers today? I left not long ago, and I’m here this time.&amp;quot; As she said that, she hugged Dust-mortal and lay on the bed. Dust-scent also lay next to Emperor Shun.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inadvertently, Dust-scent saw the roof. He stood up and looked up and walked around the room. Emperor Shun said: &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t look anymore, there is no ceiling!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香惊讶地说：“没天棚！这屋子里怎么还有发霉的味儿！通风不好！” 说着，他又躺回了顺皇的身边。娘儿三个聊了几句后，尘香忽然高兴了，站起来走到了屋地的中央说：“妈！我现在有建筑施工公司了！我给你安个天棚！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent said in surprise: &amp;quot;There is no ceiling! Why is there a musty smell in this room! The ventilation is not good!&amp;quot; As he said that, he lay back next to Emperor Shun. After the mother and sons chatted for a few words, Dust-scent suddenly became happy, stood up and walked to the center of the room and said: &amp;quot;Mom! I have a construction company now! I will install a ceiling for you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;顺皇高兴地回答：“是啊！你一来这里就开了家建筑施工公司，做了几个工程了？”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香回答：“已经完成了两个，还有一个正在进行！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;顺皇好奇地问：“赚了多少钱了？”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香羞涩地回答：“赔了三十两银子！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emperor Shun replied happily, “Yes! You opened a construction company as soon as you came here, how many projects have you done?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent replied, “Two have been completed, and one is in progress!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emperor Shun asked curiously, “How much money have you made?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent shyly replied, “Lost thirty taels of silver!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;顺皇高兴地说：“这么成功！我爸爸，你们的外公玉皇大帝，第一年做金华火腿生意，把一万两本钱赔得一两银子没剩。你真的才赔30两？”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香无可奈何地回答：“我撒谎了；我们已经赔了300两银子了！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emperor Shun said happily, &amp;quot;Such a success! My father, your grandfather, Turquoise White-king Great Creator, lost all his 10,000 taels of capital in the first year of his Jinhua ham business. Did you only lose 30 taels?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent replied hopelessly, “I lied; we&amp;#39;ve already lost 300 taels of silver!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;顺皇说：“我知道300两银子也是谎话，这次就算了。如果你敢再对我撒谎，我把你的屁股打得半个月坐不了凳子。” 说着，她抱紧了尘凡的头，嗯嗯地亲了几下。她又说：“承揽皇家的工程，你得先去县政府登记，做资格审查。过一段时间，我把这项工程的招标合同发到县政府。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emperor Shun said, &amp;quot;I know that 300 taels of silver is also a lie, so let&amp;#39;s forget it this time. If you dare to lie to me again, I&amp;#39;ll beat your ass so hard that you can&amp;#39;t sit on a stool for half a month.&amp;quot; With that, she hugged Dust-mortal&amp;#39;s head tightly and mummed and kissed him a few times. She added, &amp;quot;To undertake the Royal&amp;#39;s project, you have to go to the county government to register and do a qualification check first. After some time, I will send the bidding contract for this project to the county government.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;这时，有汉子进来说：“汉来伺候您了！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;顺皇对尘香和尘凡说：“那你们俩就回家好好准备吧！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At this time, a Han came in and said: &amp;quot;Han is here to serve you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emperor Shun said to Dust-scent and Dust-mortal: &amp;quot;Then you two go home and prepare well!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;这哥俩被送出行宫后，尘凡说：“哥哥！我才知道，你真是个演戏的天才！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香回答：“我看你一直紧紧地抱着那个女人！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After these two brothers were sent out of the palace, Dust-scent said, “Brother! I just realized that you are really a genius at acting!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent replied, “I saw you holding that woman tightly all the time!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘凡说：“你让我一直抱着她！我讨厌她，怕她看出来，所以我一直没敢抬头！奇怪了，她知道你撒谎后，还高兴了，抱紧了我，亲我的头发！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香说：“她发现我长大了，谈话有策略了，当然高兴。走，咱俩回去找棵树上去看看！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-mortal said, “You told me to hold her all the time! I hated her and was afraid she&amp;#39;d see it, so I never dared to look up! It&amp;#39;s weird, she got happy when she realized you were lying, hugged me tight, even kissed my hair!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent said, “Of course she was happy when she found out I&amp;#39;d grown up and the conversation was strategic. Come on, let&amp;#39;s go back and find a tree to check it out!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;这哥俩溜到了行宫的院墙旁边，在树上向院子里面看。行宫里除了大禹的房间都是灯火通明。一些汉子和士兵在排队进入顺皇的寝宫，不断地有人出来，又有人进去。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;哥俩看了很长时间，没琢磨出来任何结论。他们回家后，又出来爬上树，继续看。直到午夜，他俩才看见汉子和士兵们陆续回到了各自的房间，熄灭了灯。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;这哥俩怎么也没琢磨出来那些人进入顺皇的寝宫去干什么！&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two brothers slipped next to the courtyard wall of the palace and looked inside the courtyard from a tree. The palace was brightly lit except for Uncle Big Yu&amp;#39;s room. Some Hans and soldiers were lining up to enter Emperor Shun&amp;#39;s bedroom, and people were constantly coming out and going in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two brothers watched for a long time without working out any conclusions. They went home, came out and climbed the tree again, and continued to watch. It wasn&amp;#39;t until midnight that the two of them saw the Hans and the soldiers return to their rooms one after another and put out their lights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The two brothers couldn&amp;#39;t figure out what those people had gone into Emperor Shun&amp;#39;s bedroom to do!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;第二天早晨，卫兵来招呼尘香和尘凡为大禹送行。顺皇告诉他们大禹病了，需要送回武汉疗养。他俩看着大禹被两个士兵搀扶着，上了马车。顺皇过去送行，却拉住了马车夫的手，亲密地交谈了很长时间。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The next morning, the guards come to summon Dust-scent and Dust-mortal to see Big Yu off. Emperor Shun told them that Uncle Big Yu was sick and needed to be sent back to Wuhan to recuperate. They watched as Big Yu was assisted by two soldiers and got into a carriage. Emperor Shun goes over to see him off but takes the carriage driver&amp;#39;s hand and talks intimately for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;回家的路上，尘凡被气哭了，说：“我看这个黑心的女人是纯心要害死大禹叔叔。咱爸爸牛郎就是这么被她整死的！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香问：“你为什么这么想？”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the way home, Dust-mortal was enraged and cried, saying, “I think this black-hearted woman is purely trying to kill Uncle Big Yu. This is how our father, Cowboy, was screwed to death by her!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent asked, “Why do you think so?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘凡回答：“昨天，咱俩去他屋的时候，他刚被鞭刑过，伤口流出的血都从衣服上渗出来了。我还以为我看错了，就在他的伤口上用手指捅了一下。他疼得 ‘啊’ 一声，伤口又流血了。大禹叔叔的床上是空的，没有被子，天这么冷，所以他被冻感冒了。我对天发誓，这个仇我一定要报！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-mortal replied, “Yesterday, when we went to his house, he had just been whipped, and the blood from his wounds was oozing out of his clothes. I thought I was mistaken, so I stabbed my finger in his wound. He let out an &amp;#39;ah&amp;#39; in pain, and the wound bled again. Uncle Big Yu&amp;#39;s bed was empty, there was no blanket, and it was so cold, so he caught a cold. I swear to Sky that I will avenge this!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香说：“你可不要胡乱行动！大禹叔叔是圣人，是玉皇大帝给那个女人造的丈夫。目前他不会有生命危险！你答应过我：20岁开始造刀，22岁才开始复仇。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘凡说：“我知道，我保证现在不会动手；我不会破坏你的计划的。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent said, “Don&amp;#39;t act recklessly! Uncle Big Yu is a sage, the husband made by Turquoise White-King Great Creator for that woman. At present, his life will not be in danger! You promised me: you&amp;#39;ll start making sword at 20 years old, and you won&amp;#39;t start taking revenge until you&amp;#39;re 22.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust Mortal replied, “I know, and I promise I won&amp;#39;t do anything now; I won&amp;#39;t ruin your plans.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香说：“我按照大禹叔叔说的，去找那个人来当咱们建筑公司的经理，得三天后才能回来。然后由他来负责组织投标和整修行宫的工程。你若有机会，再进行宫看看，数数行宫里面有多少个男人，多少个女人。每天晚上爬到树上数数有多少人进入那个女人的卧室，记录下来。如果我回来了，你不在，我就去替换你。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent said, &amp;quot;I went to find that person to be the manager of our construction company, as Uncle Big Yu said, and will have to come back in three days. Then he will be responsible for organizing the bidding and refurbishing the palace. If you have a chance, go back to the palace and count the number of men and women in the palace. Climb up a tree every night and count how many men enter that woman&amp;#39;s bedroom and record it. If I come back and you are not here, I will go and replace you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘凡问：“数那个人数有什么用？”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;尘香回答：“我们有可能从每晚进入她卧室的人数发现些什么！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-mortal asked, “What&amp;#39;s the point of counting that number of people?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dust-scent replied, “We could possibly discover something from the number of people who enter her bedroom each night!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;怎么顺皇打大禹这么狠？这不合常理！《中华法典》中说这是顺皇在做法。一天，她忽然有了这个想法，就派人去把大禹接来了。女婴担心他们俩的关系紧张，怕闹出事故来，就跟了过来。顺皇就说出要激发尘香和尘凡内心的仇恨的做法。他们俩自幼崇拜大禹，如果大禹挨欺负了，这哥俩肯定会有救大禹的愿望，那样他们俩就成为了有用之人。顺皇说完，笑着问大禹：“你看行吗？”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why did Emperor Shun beat Yu so cruelly? This doesn&amp;#39;t make sense! The *Chinese Codex* says this was Emperor Shun performing “Making Law” (i.e., a purposeful doing). One day, she suddenly had this idea and sent someone to bring Yu to her. Heroine, worried about the tension between the two and fearing an accident, came along. Empress Shun then explained her plan to incite hatred in Dust-scent and Dust-mortal&amp;#39;s hearts. The two brothers had admired Yu since childhood, and if Yu were bullied, they would surely want to save him, that way, they would both become useful people. After Emperor Shun finished speaking, she smiled and asked Yu, &amp;quot;What do you think?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;大禹也笑了，回答：“我觉着这个想法挺好！”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;女婴看他们俩都笑了，就没反对。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;大禹说：“海南的记录里有：尘凡是个天生的猎人。要做，就必须是真的，把我的后背打出血。”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big Yu laughed and replied, &amp;quot;I think this is a great idea!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing that they were both laughing, Heroine didn&amp;#39;t object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big Yu said, &amp;quot;The records from Hainan say: Dust-mortal is a born hunter. If you&amp;#39;re going to do it, it has to be real—make my back bleed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;前文，当他们看见尘香和尘凡来了，就开始准备。执行鞭刑的将军就开始打大禹。一连打了几鞭子，大禹疼的咬牙挺着，可是他的后背没出血。女婴被气得一把推开了那位将军，夺过了鞭子，啪啪两鞭子打在了同一个地方，鲜血立刻流出来了。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Earlier, when they saw Dust-scent and Dust-mortal arrive, they began preparations. The general who was to carry out the whipping began to beat Big Yu. Several lashes were delivered in succession, and Big Yu gritted his teeth and endured the pain, but his back did not bleed. Heroine was so angry that she pushed the general away, snatched the whip, and struck the same spot twice, and blood immediately flowed out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;大禹坚持不要在伤口上上药，尘凡会嗅出来的。当天夜里，大禹确实脱了衣服，没盖被，第二天早晨，他真的开始发烧了。大禹又让女婴把他打出血了。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;结果这一切，就在大禹路过尘凡的瞬间，尘凡全都嗅到了。&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yu insisted that no medicine be applied to the wound, as Dust-mortal would smell it. That night, Yu indeed took off his clothes and went without a blanket, and the next morning, he did indeed develop a fever. Yu then had Heroine beat him until he bled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As it turned out, all of this happened the instant Yu passed by Dust-mortal, who smelled it all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeTree/comments/1r03etm/14_%E5%A5%B3%E5%A8%B2%E7%9A%84%E5%90%8E%E4%BA%BA_nuwas_descendants/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;amp;utm_term=1&amp;amp;utm_content=share_button\"&gt;返回女娲后人的目录 Return Catalog of Nuwa’s Descendants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "One of the story beats that really hooked me into Dragonwilds that I feel hasn't much been touched on of late is how Ashenfall is viewed from the outside - *someone* sent an expedition here, including several very *notable* characters, and to our knowledge all contact with that expedition has been lost, to the point that *Harold Death, Esquire himself* has shown up. You find a lot of lore books *implying* former human residence - possibly something we'll be *seeing* soon with the next area - so I feel like it would be appropriate, in the face of having now fought *two* dragons, plus the undead, the Garou, the wildlife, and a *sentient storm that hates you*... to send a more thorough *distress signal* (bearing in mind that the player was sent as a response to the *first* distress call attempt).\n\nGielinor's expedition to the Dragonwilds needs reinforcements. This proposal, assuming it's interesting enough and technically viable, seeks to add a function (probably as a result of a major post-launch DLC) where you can call in NPC adventurers to do simple tasks in exchange for sustenance, lodging, and a decent pay. This adds:\n\n* A reason to develop the artistic, expansive bases people have been posting, beyond them looking cool, as well as enhancing the \"cool\" factor by making the Homesteads feel alive.\n* The ability to automate resource gathering and processing within a defined base \"area\", possibly managed by the ability to select an area in the world with the build interface to designate for \"work\" versus \"storage\" versus \"player-only\", etc.\n* A reason to build several of various armor types, so as to properly equip new adventurers in your base.\n* The ability to firmly \"secure\" a base against raids by arming a defence force to respond against attackers, allowing the player to make progress by feeling that they've gained \"control\" of an area.\n\nThis would, however, raise several logical logistical questions: How do they get here, how do we manage the people we bring in, and why bother?\n\n**Let's answer the \"How\" first**: The light of the moon. It's dangerous to be out at night on the continent of Ashenfall, but unless it's raining, you have clear line of sight... to Gielinor's moon. Because Ashenfall is *on* Gielinor, so that moon we see *must* be Gielinor's. Except it has another name - Zanaris. The \"How\" of doing this would be a high Construction level unlock requiring completion of Dragon Slayer called the **Fairy Ring**. This object *must* be built at night, needs a lot of Bittercap Mushrooms, Astral Runes, Law Runes, and Nature Runes, and has a build limit - base of one at 50 Construction, plus one per dragon killed, and an additional limit of one per Power Level region (so only one in Brynmoor/Whispering Swamp, one in Ghornfell, one in Fellhollow, etc); per world, not per player (possibly something only the world owner can build/allow). This places a Fairy Ring that, while it is too weak for you to use to *leave*, is good enough for you to send for *assistance* and have people come back through a nearby Lodestone at the next dawn.\n\nThis will bring us first to the \"**why bother**\" - because **a Fairy Ring will be to a Lodestone like a Tanner's Kit is to a Tannery** \\- it will upgrade the Lodestone to be the \"center of base\". This will make it free to teleport *from* this Lodestone to others, making it cheaper to get out into the world. Once you have a Lodestone with a Fairy Ring nearby, you can then place a Management Desk in a building nearby, which adds a new multi-tab UI for base management. Here you can offer resources to hire people from the mainland to come help you (these ideas are just pitches): Miners will mine any ores in the base; Lumberers will cut trees as designated; Smiths can operate Furnaces and the like for you, and possibly make weapons and armor; Craftsmen can operate Kilns and Tanneries, as well as crafting things made from wood, leather, and stone (possibly even finishing ghost builds as desired); Cooks can prepare food and water for your people; Druids can make potions for you if provided, as well as tend Farming patches; Mages, Rangers, and Warriors can be recruited to either defend the base or follow you on adventures. The number you can bring in would also be limited by the number of Fairy Rings you *can* place - say, three people per base, for a maximum of nine per base at three bases for 27 at current total?\n\nOnce the workers are off the Lodestone, you can use the other tabs of the **Management Desk** to ensure wages (materials consumed for upkeep) are paid and what tasks they prioritize, as well as inspecting their levels, in the \"Aid\" tab. The third tab would be master storage management - tabs that can be opened or closed, showing what items are in what chests in your base and letting you organize all in one place. You could potentially even organize trade convoys between your bases to maintain supplies and process resources faster.\n\nFinally, however, comes the next question: **How do we manage these people?** Well, you **talk to them**. By talking to the NPCs in the world, you can ask them to follow you, ask them to work on specific tasks, or maybe even train certain skills while they wait for their stations to *finish* processing, then go off to deal with the products? If they're following you, you can open up their inventory and manage it, even tell them to equip certain things and favor certain combat types. You can then also give them food and water directly, or have them eat from communal chests. You could also ideally have NPCs gather water and foodstuffs, automate certain cooking processes, and eventually evolve your homestead into a proper outpost.\n\nBecause TL;DR, we're pioneers on the frontier, and reinforcements are right there. You, brave Dragonwilder, have started making this place safe enough that people can be brought in to back you up. The more successful you are, the wider and taller you can grow, and the more hope you'll have against Kuldra - and, importantly, the better chance you'll have of killing her and getting to *go home* \\- be that back on Gielinor, or here on Ashenfall where you have *claimed your Homestead*.",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the story beats that really hooked me into Dragonwilds that I feel hasn&amp;#39;t much been touched on of late is how Ashenfall is viewed from the outside - &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; sent an expedition here, including several very &lt;em&gt;notable&lt;/em&gt; characters, and to our knowledge all contact with that expedition has been lost, to the point that &lt;em&gt;Harold Death, Esquire himself&lt;/em&gt; has shown up. You find a lot of lore books &lt;em&gt;implying&lt;/em&gt; former human residence - possibly something we&amp;#39;ll be &lt;em&gt;seeing&lt;/em&gt; soon with the next area - so I feel like it would be appropriate, in the face of having now fought &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; dragons, plus the undead, the Garou, the wildlife, and a &lt;em&gt;sentient storm that hates you&lt;/em&gt;... to send a more thorough &lt;em&gt;distress signal&lt;/em&gt; (bearing in mind that the player was sent as a response to the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; distress call attempt).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Gielinor&amp;#39;s expedition to the Dragonwilds needs reinforcements. This proposal, assuming it&amp;#39;s interesting enough and technically viable, seeks to add a function (probably as a result of a major post-launch DLC) where you can call in NPC adventurers to do simple tasks in exchange for sustenance, lodging, and a decent pay. This adds:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A reason to develop the artistic, expansive bases people have been posting, beyond them looking cool, as well as enhancing the &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; factor by making the Homesteads feel alive.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ability to automate resource gathering and processing within a defined base &amp;quot;area&amp;quot;, possibly managed by the ability to select an area in the world with the build interface to designate for &amp;quot;work&amp;quot; versus &amp;quot;storage&amp;quot; versus &amp;quot;player-only&amp;quot;, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A reason to build several of various armor types, so as to properly equip new adventurers in your base.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ability to firmly &amp;quot;secure&amp;quot; a base against raids by arming a defence force to respond against attackers, allowing the player to make progress by feeling that they&amp;#39;ve gained &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; of an area.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This would, however, raise several logical logistical questions: How do they get here, how do we manage the people we bring in, and why bother?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;#39;s answer the &amp;quot;How&amp;quot; first&lt;/strong&gt;: The light of the moon. It&amp;#39;s dangerous to be out at night on the continent of Ashenfall, but unless it&amp;#39;s raining, you have clear line of sight... to Gielinor&amp;#39;s moon. Because Ashenfall is &lt;em&gt;on&lt;/em&gt; Gielinor, so that moon we see &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be Gielinor&amp;#39;s. Except it has another name - Zanaris. The &amp;quot;How&amp;quot; of doing this would be a high Construction level unlock requiring completion of Dragon Slayer called the &lt;strong&gt;Fairy Ring&lt;/strong&gt;. This object &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; be built at night, needs a lot of Bittercap Mushrooms, Astral Runes, Law Runes, and Nature Runes, and has a build limit - base of one at 50 Construction, plus one per dragon killed, and an additional limit of one per Power Level region (so only one in Brynmoor/Whispering Swamp, one in Ghornfell, one in Fellhollow, etc); per world, not per player (possibly something only the world owner can build/allow). This places a Fairy Ring that, while it is too weak for you to use to &lt;em&gt;leave&lt;/em&gt;, is good enough for you to send for &lt;em&gt;assistance&lt;/em&gt; and have people come back through a nearby Lodestone at the next dawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This will bring us first to the &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;why bother&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; - because &lt;strong&gt;a Fairy Ring will be to a Lodestone like a Tanner&amp;#39;s Kit is to a Tannery&lt;/strong&gt; - it will upgrade the Lodestone to be the &amp;quot;center of base&amp;quot;. This will make it free to teleport &lt;em&gt;from&lt;/em&gt; this Lodestone to others, making it cheaper to get out into the world. Once you have a Lodestone with a Fairy Ring nearby, you can then place a Management Desk in a building nearby, which adds a new multi-tab UI for base management. Here you can offer resources to hire people from the mainland to come help you (these ideas are just pitches): Miners will mine any ores in the base; Lumberers will cut trees as designated; Smiths can operate Furnaces and the like for you, and possibly make weapons and armor; Craftsmen can operate Kilns and Tanneries, as well as crafting things made from wood, leather, and stone (possibly even finishing ghost builds as desired); Cooks can prepare food and water for your people; Druids can make potions for you if provided, as well as tend Farming patches; Mages, Rangers, and Warriors can be recruited to either defend the base or follow you on adventures. The number you can bring in would also be limited by the number of Fairy Rings you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; place - say, three people per base, for a maximum of nine per base at three bases for 27 at current total?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once the workers are off the Lodestone, you can use the other tabs of the &lt;strong&gt;Management Desk&lt;/strong&gt; to ensure wages (materials consumed for upkeep) are paid and what tasks they prioritize, as well as inspecting their levels, in the &amp;quot;Aid&amp;quot; tab.

If you’re not familiar with it, we dare you to give it a try and \\*not\\* fall down the rabbit hole of available choices for everything from a Traffic Sign Recognition System to the 3D-Printed Bodyform Full Bucket Driver’s Seats (available in soft, medium or hard configurations). While many of the available options can be further configured a bit (what color deviated stitching will go best with your 2-tone Exclusive Manufaktur Leather Interior, for instance) where the customization **really** shines (literally) is the ability to choose the [Paint-To-Sample (PTS) and Paint-To-Sample Plus](https://www.porsche.com/stories/innovation/a-porsche-innovation-powered-by-your-imagination) option(s). Enabling you to pick just the right exterior paint color to satisfy your aesthetic cravings it becomes the ultimate appearance option, diametrically opposed to Henry Ford’s “[Any customer can have a car painted any colour he wants so long as it is black](http://oplaunch.com/blog/2015/04/30/the-truth-about-any-color-so-long-as-it-is-black/)” comment when speaking of his Model-T’s palette (allegedly). Fortunately, we’ve come a long way since that somewhat monochromatic era!\n\nWe were quite overwhelmed (and overjoyed) when a client approached us to help determine the PTS color to choose for his new Porsche GT3 Touring build and they were also willing to involve [our Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/esotericdetail/) followers. Towards this end, in November of 2021 the question was put forward in an Instagram poll on our feed, the result of which indicated that Iris Blue would be the choice, narrowly edging out Viola Metallic in the final run-off! Sometimes it does indeed “Take a village…”\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nocdqztxlxeg1.jpg?width=816&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2ac6fde817469b7276c74261a95e3e2dcad8960\n\nNearly a year after the color was decided on by a vote of the people the vehicle arrived at our New Albany studio for [Paint Protection Film](https://esotericdetail.com/paint-protection-film/), [Ceramic Coatings](https://esotericdetail.com/ceramic-coating/) and [Window Tint](https://esotericdetail.com/window-tint-columbus-ohio/).

If you’re not familiar with it, we dare you to give it a try and *not* fall down the rabbit hole of available choices for everything from a Traffic Sign Recognition System to the 3D-Printed Bodyform Full Bucket Driver’s Seats (available in soft, medium or hard configurations). While many of the available options can be further configured a bit (what color deviated stitching will go best with your 2-tone Exclusive Manufaktur Leather Interior, for instance) where the customization &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; shines (literally) is the ability to choose the &lt;a href=\"https://www.porsche.com/stories/innovation/a-porsche-innovation-powered-by-your-imagination\"&gt;Paint-To-Sample (PTS) and Paint-To-Sample Plus&lt;/a&gt; option(s). Enabling you to pick just the right exterior paint color to satisfy your aesthetic cravings it becomes the ultimate appearance option, diametrically opposed to Henry Ford’s “&lt;a href=\"http://oplaunch.com/blog/2015/04/30/the-truth-about-any-color-so-long-as-it-is-black/\"&gt;Any customer can have a car painted any colour he wants so long as it is black&lt;/a&gt;” comment when speaking of his Model-T’s palette (allegedly). Fortunately, we’ve come a long way since that somewhat monochromatic era!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We were quite overwhelmed (and overjoyed) when a client approached us to help determine the PTS color to choose for his new Porsche GT3 Touring build and they were also willing to involve &lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/esotericdetail/\"&gt;our Instagram&lt;/a&gt; followers. Towards this end, in November of 2021 the question was put forward in an Instagram poll on our feed, the result of which indicated that Iris Blue would be the choice, narrowly edging out Viola Metallic in the final run-off! Sometimes it does indeed “Take a village…”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nocdqztxlxeg1.jpg?width=816&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a2ac6fde817469b7276c74261a95e3e2dcad8960\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/nocdqztxlxeg1.jpg?width=816&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=a2ac6fde817469b7276c74261a95e3e2dcad8960&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nearly a year after the color was decided on by a vote of the people the vehicle arrived at our New Albany studio for &lt;a href=\"https://esotericdetail.com/paint-protection-film/\"&gt;Paint Protection Film&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://esotericdetail.com/ceramic-coating/\"&gt;Ceramic Coatings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://esotericdetail.com/window-tint-columbus-ohio/\"&gt;Window Tint&lt;/a&gt;.

          "selftext": "---\n\n---\n\nWednesday morning **EDIT:**\n\n\nI wrote a rebuttal in the AdamNeely subreddit...  which then got one downvote and zero engagement. \n\nIt looked like this: \n\n--- \n \n---\n\n(e) UDIO [...] seemed to suicide themselves out of the music A.I. race by being the first to fold under heavy legal pressure, from UMG in their case. Sure, they trained their music LLMs on \"all the best music in the world\" just like SUNO did... but they did it in such a way that left a DMCA paper trail (ripping music audio from YouTube, Spotify and Pandora, I think) directly to their front door, with a hole wide enough for a thousand greedy lawyers to crawl through.\n\n(g) At the end of the techno-capitalist day, UDIO just wants as many people as possible to pay $20 per month to play with UDIO.\n\n(h) At the end of the techno-capitalist day, SUNO wants A BILLION PEOPLE to play with SUNO and then pay them ((whatever their subscription rate is)), that way, every share of \"SUNO stock\" becomes worth actual cash and all the investors get their exit-strategy money back --- the investment finally PAYS OFF.\n\n(i) PHOTOSHOP was very cool. Everybody saw how it worked. Photo-editing software. It worked, and it worked well. ADOBE made a lot of money. And still does, to this day. I am quite sure there were techno-luddites at the time who spent their lives in darkrooms up to their wrists in fixer and developer, who complained \"That's not REAL photography!!\" From this viewpoint, in the future of 2026, Photoshop was a NEW TOOL, it worked well, people paid for it, and Adobe stock became as good as cash.\n\n(j) Just as there are major players like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google in the AI race, there are dozens if not hundreds of minor players. Deepseek, what's that? Perplexity?? TOGETHER.ai? Too many to name, I bet.\n\n(k) There is no reason that another upstart can't come to challenge SUNO and UDIO, and become the best generative AI music tool in the world, overnight.\n\n(l) The MARKETPLACE for people who WANT to play with SUNO-like tools is not nearly as big as TechBro Whatshisname wants it to be, and it never will be that big.\n\n(m) Adam Neely's rant against GenAI music is suspiciously like the fable of Taylor Swift telling all her fans \"Just ***follow your dreams!***  See how well it worked out for me!??  It can for you too!\" \n\nAdam himself is in the top 0.01 percent of lucky talented hardworking gifted musicians and he speaks from a place of pure privilege, just like a16z's \"Reality Hedonists\" or whatever they were, -- the top 0.01 percent of course.  \n\n(n) DO NOT KNOCK IT, typing a prompt that says \"melancholic indie rock, female singer\" and then the lyrics, and getting an INSTANT DEMO, is an incredible, incredible, amazing, incredible thing.   As awesome as PHOTOSHOP was back in 1990, if not even more so.\n\n(o) SO Mr. Neely who clearly knows whose side he's on, on the side of the top 0.01 percent of lucky talented gifted and hardworking live musicians in the world, looks at the tool and decides it's bad.  And if he can get his MILLION FOLLOWERS to think it's bad, then \n\n(p) a16z won't get their exit-strategy money back, SUNO will lose a bunch of lawsuits, the public will HATE! HATE! HATE! A.I. generated or assisted music, and much of value will be lost.  Let's go back to (n). \n\n(q) DO NOT KNOCK IT, typing in a prompt that says \"melancholic indie rock, female singer\" and then the lyrics, and getting an INSTANT DEMO, is an incredible, incredible, amazing, incredible thing.   As awesome as PHOTOSHOP was back in 1990, if not even more so.  Available  right now, for free, to everyone. \n\n(r) I am a huge Adam Neely fan as well.  But there is a REBUTTAL to be made.\n\n(s) Neely has a fun observation that the invention of CAMERA is right where the CINEMA / THEATER timelines split\n\nand yeah, cinema and theater ARE two different art forms\n\nand yeah, live music and \"Studio Albums\" are two different things\n\nbut it is the AVAILABILITY of better and better and cheaper tools\n\nand maybe that's a GOOD thing\n\n(t) and SUNO/UDIO are incredible modern tools that are like CHEAP POCKET CINEMA-CAMERAS FOR EVERYBODY\n\n(u) so Neely is taking the position that this is a ... bad thing? You sure that's what you want to go with, Adam?\n\n(v) Neely zooms in on a16z's love of the Italian future accelerationists, well what's not to like? They became fascists? So what!?\n\n(w) The darker chuckle: of a16z on Joe Rogan \"We're all gonna HAVE to endorse TRUMP! Ha ha ha!!\" I still don't quite understand it.\n\nPerhaps in five years in the future, when I'm being crushed under the boot during Trump's Third Term, for not drinking enough Mountain Dew Verification Cans, I will understand that moment from this video a little bit better.\n\n(x) Only Minneapolis protesting with 100,000 people in -40 degree weather, gives me any hope nowadays.\n\n(y) When all the rest of the news is utterly, completely horrible.\n\n(z) Why are things getting worse? Where is the hope, the sunshine, the love?\n\n---\n\n=== ==== =====\n\n---\n\n\nThen, frustrated, I had Claude whip up a rebuttal for me.  Because if anything is begging for a rebuttal, it's that Adam Neely video.  Which I loved --- thank you, Adam!\n\n--- \n\n=== ==== ===== \n\n--- \n\n\n# In Defense of the Future: Why Adam Neely's \"AI Music Bad\" Misses the Point\n\n## Introduction: The Argument from Nostalgia\n\nAdam Neely has given us a masterclass in sophisticated Luddism—wrapping legitimate concerns in philosophical garnish, historical parallels, and the comforting mythology that *this time* technological disruption is different, *this time* it's existentially dangerous, *this time* we must resist.\n\nBut strip away the Platonic virtue ethics, the Italian Futurism parallels, and the guilt-by-association politics, and what remains? An accomplished musician, understandably anxious about his craft's future, constructing an elaborate intellectual framework to justify what is ultimately an emotional position: *I don't like this, therefore it must be bad.*\n\nLet me be clear: I'm not here to defend Mikey Shulman's every utterance, Suno's business practices, or Marc Andreessen's political trajectory. I'm here to argue that **Adam's core thesis—that generative AI in music represents an unprecedented threat requiring categorical rejection—is fundamentally wrong, historically myopic, and ultimately harmful to the very musicians he claims to protect.**\n\n## I. The Photoshop Precedent: Why This Time ISN'T Different\n\n### The Darkroom Defenders Were Right (And Also Wrong)\n\nAdam dismisses the Photoshop comparison too quickly. Yes, there were photographers who claimed digital manipulation \"wasn't real photography.\" And you know what? **They were right.** Photoshop fundamentally changed what photography *was*. It severed the ontological link between image and reality that had defined the medium for 150 years.\n\nBut they were also **completely wrong** about what that meant.\n\nPhotography didn't die. It **bifurcated**:\n- Photojournalism developed strict ethical codes about manipulation\n- Art photography embraced limitless possibility\n- Commercial photography became more accessible and democratic\n- Film photography became a respected niche craft\n\nThe photographers who adapted thrived. The ones who didn't became historical footnotes—not because they lacked skill, but because they **mistook their medium for their craft**.\n\n### What MIDI Actually Did\n\nAdam acknowledges MIDI as disruptive but claims AI is different because of \"sociopolitical agenda.\" Let's examine what actually happened with MIDI:\n\n**MIDI eliminated:**\n- Studio musicians (session work collapsed)\n- Orchestrators (why hire someone when General MIDI has 128 instruments?)\n- Entire recording studios (home production became viable)\n\n**MIDI's \"sociopolitical agenda\":**\n- Developed by corporations (Roland, Yamaha, Sequential Circuits)\n- Pushed by tech companies wanting to sell equipment\n- Advocated by a small class of early adopters\n- Explicitly designed to **replace human performers with machines**\n\nSound familiar?\n\nThe difference isn't the technology or the agenda—it's that **we're living through this disruption** instead of reading about it in retrospect. In 1983, there were absolutely musicians making the exact same arguments Adam makes now: MIDI deskills musicians, destroys community, serves corporate interests, threatens craft.\n\nThey were right about the disruption. They were wrong about the conclusion.\n\n## II. The Craft Fallacy: Confusing Medium with Meaning\n\n### Victor Wooten Doesn't Care About Your Fingers\n\nAdam worships craft—specifically, **manual craft**. His role models (Victor Wooten, Jaco Pastorius) are virtuosos of physical technique. This reveals a deep bias: **he conflates the difficulty of execution with the value of the art.**\n\nBut let's do a thought experiment:\n\n**Scenario A:** I spend 10,000 hours mastering the bass. I can play anything Victor Wooten plays. I perform it live, flawlessly. But I have nothing new to say musically. I'm technically perfect and artistically derivative.\n\n**Scenario B:** Someone with minimal technical skill uses AI tools to create genuinely novel, emotionally resonant music that moves people, creates community, and advances the art form.\n\nWhich is more valuable?\n\nAdam would say Scenario A, because **craft**. I say he's confusing the **means** with the **ends**.\n\n### Bach Didn't Need to Mine His Own Iron\n\nHere's what Adam misses: **Every artist in history has used the best tools available to them.**\n\n- Bach didn't smelt his own organ pipes\n- Jimi Hendrix didn't wind his own guitar pickups\n- Beethoven didn't handcraft his piano\n- Modern producers don't code their own DAWs\n\nThe **abstraction of technical difficulty** has been the story of every artistic medium. Painters stopped grinding their own pigments. Photographers stopped mixing their own chemicals. Filmmakers stopped hand-cranking cameras.\n\nAt each stage, critics mourned the \"death of craft.\" At each stage, **the art form exploded in new directions** because artists could focus on **what to say** rather than **how to physically execute it.**\n\n### The Rick Rubin Vindication\n\nAdam mocks Mikey's admiration for Rick Rubin—the producer who \"knows nothing about music\" technically. But this is actually the **strongest argument FOR the taste-over-technique position.**\n\nRick Rubin has:\n- Revitalized Johnny Cash's career\n- Shaped the sound of hip-hop\n- Produced iconic albums across genres\n- Earned universal respect from musicians\n\nHis **lack** of technical ability isn't a bug—it's a feature. It forces him to focus purely on **what sounds good**, unencumbered by \"that's not how you're supposed to do it.\"\n\nAdam says \"we can't all be Rick Rubin.\" Why not? **What if the artificial scarcity of musical ability has been holding back thousands of potential Rick Rubins** who have taste, vision, and something to say, but lack the decade of technical training required to execute it?\n\n## III. The Community Canard: Romanticizing Gatekeeping\n\n### The Musical Community That Never Was\n\nAdam waxes poetic about musical community, collaboration, and shared cultural knowledge. As if the history of music is some egalitarian folk tradition rather than what it actually is: **a series of gatekept institutions controlling access to the means of production.**\n\nLet's talk about who **actually** got to participate in \"musical community\" historically:\n\n- Those who could afford instruments\n- Those who could afford lessons  \n- Those whose parents supported musical education\n- Those who lived near music schools\n- Those with free time to practice (i.e., not working-class people with multiple jobs)\n- Those welcomed by existing musical communities (not women in jazz, not Black musicians in classical, not working-class kids in conservatories)\n\nAdam's \"musical community\" is **deeply exclusionary** and always has been. He's romanticizing a gatekeeping system that worked for him (educated, middle-class, white, male musician) and calling it virtue.\n\n### The Narcissism Critique is Projection\n\nAdam is horrified that Suno users listen primarily to their own music. He calls this \"narcissistic\" and contrasts it with his own practice of... having role models who inspire him to make music that sounds like his role models.\n\nWait, what?\n\nLet's be honest about what \"influences\" actually mean: **I listen to music that reflects my taste, then I make music that reflects my taste, then I share it with people who share my taste.** \n\nThe Suno user listening to their own AI-generated music is doing **the exact same thing**, just with fewer intermediate steps. They're not more narcissistic—they're just **more efficient** at getting to music that matches their taste.\n\nAnd you know what? **That's fine.** Not everyone needs to be part of Adam's jazz-fusion community. Some people just want music that sounds good to them, for their own enjoyment, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\n### Shared Culture is Overrated (And Mostly Fictional)\n\nAdam mourns the loss of \"shared cultural knowledge\"—everyone singing along to the same song. But when exactly was this golden age?\n\n- In the 1950s when rock &amp; roll was \"destroying music\"?\n- In the 1920s when jazz was \"degrading culture\"?\n- In the 1890s when ragtime was \"threatening civilization\"?\n- In the 1600s when opera was \"corrupting morals\"?\n\n**There has never been a unified musical culture.** There have always been fragments, subcultures, niches, and gatekeepers claiming their fragment was the \"real\" culture.\n\nThe internet didn't destroy shared musical culture—it revealed that **it never existed in the first place.** And the hyperpersonalization Adam fears? It's just people **finally getting to opt out of whatever dominant culture was being imposed on them.**\n\n## IV. The Deskilling Myth: Confusing Tools with Thinking\n\n### Doctors and Dishonesty\n\nAdam's deskilling argument relies heavily on the medical study about colonoscopy AI. But he's either misunderstanding or misrepresenting what happened.\n\nThe doctors didn't become \"worse\" at finding growths. They became **more reliant on the tool.** When the tool was removed, there was temporary degradation until they readjusted. This is called **tool dependence**, and it's how **every tool in human history works.**\n\n- Literacy made people \"worse\" at oral memorization\n- Calculators made people \"worse\" at mental math  \n- GPS made people \"worse\" at navigation\n- Spellcheck made people \"worse\" at spelling\n\nAre we worse off? **Obviously not.** We've offloaded lower-level cognitive tasks to tools so we can focus on higher-level thinking.\n\nThe real question isn't \"will AI make musicians dependent on it?\" Of course it will. **That's what tools do.**\n\nThe question is: **What will musicians do with the cognitive capacity freed up by not having to manually execute every technical detail?**\n\n### ChatGPT Doesn't Make You Dumber\n\nAdam claims \"ChatGPT makes you dumber.\" This is **provably false** and reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of cognitive science.\n\nWhat ChatGPT does is change **where you allocate cognitive resources.** Yes, if you use it to avoid thinking, you'll atrophy those skills. But if you use it to **explore more ideas faster, iterate more rapidly, and focus on higher-level creative decisions**, you'll become **more** capable, not less.\n\nThe same is true for music AI. \n\n**Bad usage:** \"AI, make me a song.\" [publishes whatever comes out]\n\n**Good usage:** \"AI, give me 10 variations on this melody. Now combine elements from #3 and #7. Now try it in a different key. Now add a counter-melody that contrasts with—wait, that's interesting, why does that work? Let me explore that musical relationship further...\"\n\nThe tool doesn't determine the outcome. **The user's engagement does.**\n\n### Prompt Engineering IS a Craft\n\nAdam dismisses prompt engineering as \"not a craft\" because you don't know exactly what you'll get. But this reveals a **shockingly narrow definition of craft.**\n\nBy his logic:\n- Gardening isn't a craft (you don't control exactly how plants grow)\n- Cooking isn't a craft (chemical reactions are unpredictable)\n- Throwing pottery isn't a craft (the kiln does unpredictable things)\n- Watercolor painting isn't a craft (water behaves probabilistically)\n\n**Every craft involves managing uncertainty.** The skill is in **guiding probabilistic processes toward desired outcomes.** \n\nPrompt engineering is **exactly that**—learning to speak the language of the system, understanding its tendencies, developing intuition for what inputs produce what outputs, iterating until you achieve your vision.\n\nThat's not \"randomness.\" That's **craft in the age of stochastic tools.**\n\n## V. The Market Reality: Why the Billion-User Vision Fails (And Why That's Fine)\n\nHere I'll actually **agree** with the skepticism, but draw different conclusions.\n\n### Mikey is Wrong About Scale\n\nMikey Shulman's billion-user vision is almost certainly fantasy. The market for \"make music without learning music\" is probably:\n\n- **Smaller than he thinks** (millions, not billions)\n- **Less sticky** (novelty wears off)\n- **Lower-value** (won't support $20/month long-term)\n\nBut **so what?**\n\nPhotography didn't need a billion photographers for digital cameras to be revolutionary. Video editing didn't need a billion editors for Adobe Premiere to matter. Music production doesn't need a billion producers for AI tools to be valuable.\n\n### The Real Market: Professional Enhancement\n\nThe actual sustainable market isn't \"replace musicians\"—it's \"make musicians more capable.\"\n\n**The tools that will win:**\n- AI mixing/mastering (already happening with iZotope, LANDR)\n- AI arrangement suggestions (already happening with Orb Composer)\n- AI stem separation (already revolutionary with Demucs, RipX)\n- AI transcription (already standard with AnthemScore)\n- AI practice tools (emerging with Moises, Yousician)\n\nThese tools **enhance** professional capability. They're the actual Photoshop—and professional musicians are **already using them** without the existential hand-wringing.\n\n### Why Suno Might Fail (And Why That's Irrelevant to the Broader Point)\n\nSuno might collapse because:\n- Copyright lawsuits succeed\n- User growth plateaus\n- Competitors commoditize the tech\n- The business model doesn't scale\n\nBut the **technology** won't disappear. It'll get absorbed into:\n- DAWs (Logic, Ableton, FL Studio will add AI generation)\n- Streaming platforms (Spotify will add personalization)\n- Social media (TikTok already has AI music tools)\n- Gaming (procedural music generation)\n\nSuno failing doesn't mean AI music fails. It means **Suno's particular business model** failed. The technology is inevitable because **the technology works and people want it.**\n\n## VI. The Political Red Herring: Guilt by Association\n\nThis is where Adam's argument becomes truly dishonest.\n\n### The Fascism Gambit\n\nAdam spends **enormous time** connecting:\n- Suno → Investors → Marc Andreessen → Techno-optimism → Italian Futurism → Fascism\n\nThis is **textbook guilt by association.** By this logic:\n\n- Highways → Built by Eisenhower → Who studied Prussian military → Prussia → Authoritarianism → Therefore highways are fascist\n- Vegetarianism → Promoted by Hitler → Therefore vegetarians are Nazis  \n- Film → Loved by Leni Riefenstahl → Therefore cinema is fascist propaganda\n\nThe fact that **bad people like a thing** doesn't make **the thing bad.**\n\n### Separating Tech from Politics\n\nYes, Marc Andreessen has concerning political views. Yes, some AI investors support troubling political movements. **This is irrelevant to whether AI music tools are valuable.**\n\nAdam is doing exactly what he claims to oppose: **letting a political agenda determine his evaluation of technology** rather than evaluating the technology on its merits.\n\n**The technology is politically neutral.** It can be used by fascists or anarchists, capitalists or communists, centralized platforms or distributed networks. The **implementation and governance** matter—not the underlying capability.\n\n### The Network State Strawman\n\nAdam fearmongers about \"network states\" and \"parallel systems\" as if:\n- Decentralized communities are inherently authoritarian\n- Alternative institutions are inherently fascist  \n- Skepticism of centralized government is inherently right-wing\n\nBut **leftists have been building parallel institutions for centuries:**\n- Worker cooperatives\n- Mutual aid networks  \n- Community land trusts\n- Alternative schools\n\nThe **structure** (parallel institutions) isn't the problem. The **politics governing those structures** is what matters.\n\n## VII. The Live Music Cope: Misunderstanding the Future\n\nAdam's final prediction—that live music will become the \"prestige\" art form while recorded music becomes \"slop\"—reveals **catastrophic misunderstanding** of how technology and culture interact.\n\n### Why This Won't Happen\n\n**1. Recorded music is the dominant form** and will remain so because:\n- Scale (reach millions vs. hundreds)\n- Permanence (exists beyond the moment)\n- Curation (can be perfected, edited, refined)\n- Economics (one creation, infinite consumption)\n\n**2. Live music is already niche** compared to recorded:\n- Most music consumption is recorded\n- Most musicians make most money from recordings (streaming/sync)\n- Most cultural impact comes from recordings\n- Live music is **supplementary** to recorded, not the other way around\n\n**3. The theater/cinema comparison is backwards:**\n- Theater didn't become \"prestige\" when film emerged\n- Film became **dominant** because it's **better suited to the medium of storytelling at scale**\n- Theater survived as a **niche** art form, not the prestige version\n\n**4. COVID proved the opposite** of what Adam claims:\n- Yes, people wanted live music back\n- But streaming, recording, and digital consumption **exploded** and stayed high\n- Virtual performances **didn't replace** live, but they're now a permanent **additional revenue stream**\n- The \"lesson\" isn't \"virtual bad, live good\"—it's \"people want both, and digital is sticky\"\n\n### The Real Future: Hybrid and Augmented\n\nThe actual future is:\n\n**Recorded music:**\n- AI tools become standard in production (already happening)\n- Barrier to entry drops (already happening)\n- Volume of music explodes (already happening)\n- Discovery and curation become the valuable skills (already happening)\n\n**Live music:**\n- **Enhanced by technology** (real-time AI processing, augmented performance)\n- Becomes more about **spectacle and experience** (already happening)\n- Coexists with recorded, doesn't replace it\n\n**New forms emerge:**\n- Interactive music (AI-generated soundtracks for your life)\n- Collaborative creation (multiplayer music-making)\n- Personalized performance (AI artists that learn your taste)\n- Hybrid live/recorded (augmented performances, virtual collaborations)\n\nAdam wants to freeze music at \"the way it was when I learned it.\" But music has **never been static**, and **musicians who adapt have always thrived while those who resist have always faded.**\n\n## VIII. What Adam Gets Right (And Why It Doesn't Matter)\n\nLet me be fair: Adam is **correct** about several things:\n\n### Real Problems:\n\n**1. Copyright is unsettled**\n- Yes, training on copyrighted work is legally dubious\n- Yes, this needs resolution\n- But \"needs legal resolution\" ≠ \"must be banned\"\n\n**2. Some usage is narcissistic**\n- Yes, some people will use it to create content only they enjoy\n- But **so what?** Not all music needs to be for community\n- Personal enjoyment is valid\n\n**3. Corporate consolidation is concerning**\n- Yes, a few companies controlling AI music is problematic\n- But the solution is **open-source alternatives**, not rejecting the technology\n\n**4. Deskilling is a real risk**\n- Yes, over-reliance on AI can atrophy skills\n- But this is true of **every tool ever**\n- The solution is **education about tool usage**, not Luddism\n\n**5. Some investors have bad politics**\n- Yes, and that's concerning\n- But **build alternative implementations** rather than ceding the technology to them\n\n### Why These Don't Justify His Conclusion\n\nAdam treats these problems as **inherent to the technology** rather than **contingent on implementation.**\n\nIt's like arguing \"cars are bad because:\n- Some carmakers have shady practices\n- Some people drive recklessly\n- Cars enable suburban sprawl\n- Oil companies have political agendas\n- Some people become dependent and can't walk anymore\"\n\nAll true! And yet **cars are net-positive**, and the solution is **better regulation, better design, and better education**—not rejecting automobiles.\n\n## IX. The Real Stakes: What We Lose By Resisting\n\nAdam frames this as \"what we lose if we adopt AI.\" But let's flip it:\n\n### What We Lose By Rejecting AI:\n\n**1. Accessibility**\n- Millions of people with musical ideas but no training remain locked out\n- The current gatekeeping system (lessons, instruments, time) remains intact\n- Music remains the province of the privileged\n\n**2. Innovation**\n- New musical forms that could emerge from AI-human collaboration never develop\n- Musicians who could have used AI to explore new territory stick to familiar patterns\n- The art form stagnates in defense of \"craft\"\n\n**3. Economic Opportunity**\n- Musicians who could augment their work with AI fall behind those who do\n- New markets (interactive music, personalized soundtracks, AI collaboration) go unexplored\n- The \"adapt or die\" pattern Adam acknowledges continues, but the refuseniks lose\n\n**4. Cultural Evolution**\n- The next generation grows up with AI music tools and considers them normal\n- Musicians who rejected them become dinosaurs, like film photographers in 2025\n- The cultural conversation moves on without the resisters\n\n**5. Control of the Technology**\n- By ceding the field to \"techno-capitalists,\" musicians ensure they have **no voice** in how it develops\n- Open-source alternatives never emerge because the community rejects the technology entirely\n- The worst-case scenario Adam fears becomes **more likely**, not less\n\n## X. A Better Path Forward\n\nInstead of Adam's categorical rejection, I propose **critical engagement:**\n\n### For Individual Musicians:\n\n**1. Experiment thoughtfully**\n- Use AI as a **tool for exploration**, not a **replacement for thinking**\n- Develop your taste and curatorial skills\n- Learn prompt engineering as a **complement** to traditional skills\n\n**2. Maintain fundamentals**\n- Keep practicing your instrument\n- Keep studying theory  \n- Keep collaborating with humans\n- Use AI to **enhance**, not replace, these practices\n\n**3. Develop hybrid workflows**\n- Use AI for ideation, humans for refinement\n- Use AI for tedious tasks, humans for creative decisions\n- Use AI to explore spaces you couldn't access manually\n\n### For the Community:\n\n**1. Build open-source alternatives**\n- Don't cede the technology to corporations\n- Create tools **by musicians, for musicians**\n- Ensure democratic access and control\n\n**2. Establish ethical norms**\n- Develop consensus on appropriate/inappropriate uses\n- Create attribution standards\n- Build licensing frameworks\n\n**3. Advocate for legal clarity**\n- Push for fair copyright frameworks\n- Ensure artist compensation\n- Protect against harmful uses\n\n### For the Industry:\n\n**1. Embrace as enhancement, not replacement**\n- AI mixing/mastering tools (already happening productively)\n- AI practice/education tools  \n- AI accessibility tools\n\n**2. Develop new markets**\n- Interactive music experiences\n- Personalized soundtracks\n- AI-augmented live performance\n\n**3. Create hybrid models**\n- Human-AI collaboration as a category\n- Transparent labeling of AI involvement\n- Economic models that value both\n\n## Conclusion: The Future Happens Whether You Like It Or Not\n\nAdam ends his video with a call to \"refuse\"—to reject the premise that the future is settled, to embrace alternative values (service, patience, craft, beauty), and to hope that live music survives as a refuge from AI slop.\n\nThis is **beautiful, eloquent, and completely futile.**\n\nThe future **is** unsettled—not because we can stop AI music, but because **how we implement it** remains open. Adam's refusal strategy guarantees that **musicians have no voice in that implementation.** By sitting out the conversation, by treating engagement as collaboration with fascism, by retreating to the \"purity\" of acoustic performance, musicians ensure they become **irrelevant to the future of their own medium.**\n\nThe synthesizer didn't kill the piano. Photoshop didn't kill photography. MIDI didn't kill musicians. And AI won't kill music.\n\nBut **in each case**, the musicians who thrived were those who **embraced the new possibilities** while maintaining **connection to fundamental principles.** They didn't confuse **the means** (tools, techniques) with **the ends** (beauty, expression, connection).\n\nAdam Neely is a brilliant musician, educator, and thinker. His videos have taught me immense amounts about music theory, history, and culture. But on this issue, he's **catastrophically wrong**—not because his concerns are invalid, but because his conclusion is **strategic suicide disguised as principled resistance.**\n\nThe future of music will include AI. The question isn't whether, but **how**. And the musicians who answer that question—who engage, experiment, and shape the technology rather than rejecting it—will be the ones we remember as **visionaries** rather than **fossils.**\n\nAdam wants to be on the right side of history. But history doesn't have sides. It has **victors and casualties**, **adapters and dinosaurs**, **those who shaped the future and those who were shaped by it.**\n\nI know which side I'd rather be on.\n\n---\n\n**Coda: The Real Lesson from Arthur C. Clarke**\n\nAdam invokes Arthur C. Clarke repeatedly but misses **Clarke's actual lesson.** Clarke didn't predict the future by identifying what would stay the same. He predicted it by **imagining what could be different and taking it seriously.**\n\nClarke's Third Law: **\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\"**\n\nTo musicians in 1950, the synthesizer was magic.  \nTo musicians in 1980, MIDI was magic.  \nTo musicians in 2000, Auto-Tune was magic.  \nTo musicians in 2025, AI music generation is magic.\n\nAnd in every case, the **magic became mundane**, the **impossible became standard**, and the **musicians who learned the spells thrived while those who denounced them as witchcraft faded into irrelevance.**\n\nThe real question isn't \"Is AI music bad?\"\n\nIt's \"What will you create with it?\"",

Sure, they trained their music LLMs on &amp;quot;all the best music in the world&amp;quot; just like SUNO did... but they did it in such a way that left a DMCA paper trail (ripping music audio from YouTube, Spotify and Pandora, I think) directly to their front door, with a hole wide enough for a thousand greedy lawyers to crawl through.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(g) At the end of the techno-capitalist day, UDIO just wants as many people as possible to pay $20 per month to play with UDIO.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(h) At the end of the techno-capitalist day, SUNO wants A BILLION PEOPLE to play with SUNO and then pay them ((whatever their subscription rate is)), that way, every share of &amp;quot;SUNO stock&amp;quot; becomes worth actual cash and all the investors get their exit-strategy money back --- the investment finally PAYS OFF.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(i) PHOTOSHOP was very cool. Everybody saw how it worked. Photo-editing software. It worked, and it worked well. ADOBE made a lot of money. And still does, to this day. I am quite sure there were techno-luddites at the time who spent their lives in darkrooms up to their wrists in fixer and developer, who complained &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not REAL photography!!&amp;quot; From this viewpoint, in the future of 2026, Photoshop was a NEW TOOL, it worked well, people paid for it, and Adobe stock became as good as cash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(j) Just as there are major players like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google in the AI race, there are dozens if not hundreds of minor players. Deepseek, what&amp;#39;s that? Perplexity?? TOGETHER.ai? Too many to name, I bet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(k) There is no reason that another upstart can&amp;#39;t come to challenge SUNO and UDIO, and become the best generative AI music tool in the world, overnight.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(l) The MARKETPLACE for people who WANT to play with SUNO-like tools is not nearly as big as TechBro Whatshisname wants it to be, and it never will be that big.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(m) Adam Neely&amp;#39;s rant against GenAI music is suspiciously like the fable of Taylor Swift telling all her fans &amp;quot;Just &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;follow your dreams!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  See how well it worked out for me!??  It can for you too!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam himself is in the top 0.01 percent of lucky talented hardworking gifted musicians and he speaks from a place of pure privilege, just like a16z&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Reality Hedonists&amp;quot; or whatever they were, -- the top 0.01 percent of course.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(n) DO NOT KNOCK IT, typing a prompt that says &amp;quot;melancholic indie rock, female singer&amp;quot; and then the lyrics, and getting an INSTANT DEMO, is an incredible, incredible, amazing, incredible thing.   As awesome as PHOTOSHOP was back in 1990, if not even more so.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(o) SO Mr. Neely who clearly knows whose side he&amp;#39;s on, on the side of the top 0.01 percent of lucky talented gifted and hardworking live musicians in the world, looks at the tool and decides it&amp;#39;s bad.  And if he can get his MILLION FOLLOWERS to think it&amp;#39;s bad, then &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(p) a16z won&amp;#39;t get their exit-strategy money back, SUNO will lose a bunch of lawsuits, the public will HATE! HATE! HATE! A.I. generated or assisted music, and much of value will be lost.  Let&amp;#39;s go back to (n). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(q) DO NOT KNOCK IT, typing in a prompt that says &amp;quot;melancholic indie rock, female singer&amp;quot; and then the lyrics, and getting an INSTANT DEMO, is an incredible, incredible, amazing, incredible thing.   As awesome as PHOTOSHOP was back in 1990, if not even more so.  Available  right now, for free, to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(r) I am a huge Adam Neely fan as well.  But there is a REBUTTAL to be made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(s) Neely has a fun observation that the invention of CAMERA is right where the CINEMA / THEATER timelines split&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and yeah, cinema and theater ARE two different art forms&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and yeah, live music and &amp;quot;Studio Albums&amp;quot; are two different things&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;but it is the AVAILABILITY of better and better and cheaper tools&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;and maybe that&amp;#39;s a GOOD thing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(t) and SUNO/UDIO are incredible modern tools that are like CHEAP POCKET CINEMA-CAMERAS FOR EVERYBODY&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(u) so Neely is taking the position that this is a ... bad thing? You sure that&amp;#39;s what you want to go with, Adam?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(v) Neely zooms in on a16z&amp;#39;s love of the Italian future accelerationists, well what&amp;#39;s not to like? They became fascists? So what!?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(w) The darker chuckle: of a16z on Joe Rogan &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re all gonna HAVE to endorse TRUMP! Ha ha ha!!&amp;quot; I still don&amp;#39;t quite understand it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perhaps in five years in the future, when I&amp;#39;m being crushed under the boot during Trump&amp;#39;s Third Term, for not drinking enough Mountain Dew Verification Cans, I will understand that moment from this video a little bit better.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(x) Only Minneapolis protesting with 100,000 people in -40 degree weather, gives me any hope nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(y) When all the rest of the news is utterly, completely horrible.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;(z) Why are things getting worse? Where is the hope, the sunshine, the love?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;=== ==== =====&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, frustrated, I had Claude whip up a rebuttal for me.  Because if anything is begging for a rebuttal, it&amp;#39;s that Adam Neely video.  Which I loved --- thank you, Adam!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;=== ==== ===== &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;In Defense of the Future: Why Adam Neely&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;AI Music Bad&amp;quot; Misses the Point&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Introduction: The Argument from Nostalgia&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam Neely has given us a masterclass in sophisticated Luddism—wrapping legitimate concerns in philosophical garnish, historical parallels, and the comforting mythology that &lt;em&gt;this time&lt;/em&gt; technological disruption is different, &lt;em&gt;this time&lt;/em&gt; it&amp;#39;s existentially dangerous, &lt;em&gt;this time&lt;/em&gt; we must resist.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But strip away the Platonic virtue ethics, the Italian Futurism parallels, and the guilt-by-association politics, and what remains? An accomplished musician, understandably anxious about his craft&amp;#39;s future, constructing an elaborate intellectual framework to justify what is ultimately an emotional position: &lt;em&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like this, therefore it must be bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me be clear: I&amp;#39;m not here to defend Mikey Shulman&amp;#39;s every utterance, Suno&amp;#39;s business practices, or Marc Andreessen&amp;#39;s political trajectory. I&amp;#39;m here to argue that &lt;strong&gt;Adam&amp;#39;s core thesis—that generative AI in music represents an unprecedented threat requiring categorical rejection—is fundamentally wrong, historically myopic, and ultimately harmful to the very musicians he claims to protect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;I. The Photoshop Precedent: Why This Time ISN&amp;#39;T Different&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Darkroom Defenders Were Right (And Also Wrong)&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam dismisses the Photoshop comparison too quickly. Yes, there were photographers who claimed digital manipulation &amp;quot;wasn&amp;#39;t real photography.&amp;quot; And you know what? &lt;strong&gt;They were right.&lt;/strong&gt; Photoshop fundamentally changed what photography &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt;. It severed the ontological link between image and reality that had defined the medium for 150 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they were also &lt;strong&gt;completely wrong&lt;/strong&gt; about what that meant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Photography didn&amp;#39;t die. It &lt;strong&gt;bifurcated&lt;/strong&gt;:\n- Photojournalism developed strict ethical codes about manipulation\n- Art photography embraced limitless possibility\n- Commercial photography became more accessible and democratic\n- Film photography became a respected niche craft&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The photographers who adapted thrived. The ones who didn&amp;#39;t became historical footnotes—not because they lacked skill, but because they &lt;strong&gt;mistook their medium for their craft&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What MIDI Actually Did&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam acknowledges MIDI as disruptive but claims AI is different because of &amp;quot;sociopolitical agenda.&amp;quot; Let&amp;#39;s examine what actually happened with MIDI:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIDI eliminated:&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Studio musicians (session work collapsed)\n- Orchestrators (why hire someone when General MIDI has 128 instruments?)\n- Entire recording studios (home production became viable)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIDI&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;sociopolitical agenda&amp;quot;:&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Developed by corporations (Roland, Yamaha, Sequential Circuits)\n- Pushed by tech companies wanting to sell equipment\n- Advocated by a small class of early adopters\n- Explicitly designed to &lt;strong&gt;replace human performers with machines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The difference isn&amp;#39;t the technology or the agenda—it&amp;#39;s that &lt;strong&gt;we&amp;#39;re living through this disruption&lt;/strong&gt; instead of reading about it in retrospect. In 1983, there were absolutely musicians making the exact same arguments Adam makes now: MIDI deskills musicians, destroys community, serves corporate interests, threatens craft.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were right about the disruption. They were wrong about the conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;II. The Craft Fallacy: Confusing Medium with Meaning&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Victor Wooten Doesn&amp;#39;t Care About Your Fingers&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam worships craft—specifically, &lt;strong&gt;manual craft&lt;/strong&gt;. His role models (Victor Wooten, Jaco Pastorius) are virtuosos of physical technique. This reveals a deep bias: &lt;strong&gt;he conflates the difficulty of execution with the value of the art.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;#39;s do a thought experiment:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario A:&lt;/strong&gt; I spend 10,000 hours mastering the bass. I can play anything Victor Wooten plays. I perform it live, flawlessly. But I have nothing new to say musically. I&amp;#39;m technically perfect and artistically derivative.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scenario B:&lt;/strong&gt; Someone with minimal technical skill uses AI tools to create genuinely novel, emotionally resonant music that moves people, creates community, and advances the art form.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which is more valuable?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam would say Scenario A, because &lt;strong&gt;craft&lt;/strong&gt;. I say he&amp;#39;s confusing the &lt;strong&gt;means&lt;/strong&gt; with the &lt;strong&gt;ends&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Bach Didn&amp;#39;t Need to Mine His Own Iron&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what Adam misses: &lt;strong&gt;Every artist in history has used the best tools available to them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bach didn&amp;#39;t smelt his own organ pipes&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Jimi Hendrix didn&amp;#39;t wind his own guitar pickups&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Beethoven didn&amp;#39;t handcraft his piano&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Modern producers don&amp;#39;t code their own DAWs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;abstraction of technical difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; has been the story of every artistic medium. Painters stopped grinding their own pigments. Photographers stopped mixing their own chemicals. Filmmakers stopped hand-cranking cameras.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At each stage, critics mourned the &amp;quot;death of craft.&amp;quot; At each stage, &lt;strong&gt;the art form exploded in new directions&lt;/strong&gt; because artists could focus on &lt;strong&gt;what to say&lt;/strong&gt; rather than &lt;strong&gt;how to physically execute it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Rick Rubin Vindication&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam mocks Mikey&amp;#39;s admiration for Rick Rubin—the producer who &amp;quot;knows nothing about music&amp;quot; technically. But this is actually the &lt;strong&gt;strongest argument FOR the taste-over-technique position.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rick Rubin has:\n- Revitalized Johnny Cash&amp;#39;s career\n- Shaped the sound of hip-hop\n- Produced iconic albums across genres\n- Earned universal respect from musicians&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His &lt;strong&gt;lack&lt;/strong&gt; of technical ability isn&amp;#39;t a bug—it&amp;#39;s a feature. It forces him to focus purely on &lt;strong&gt;what sounds good&lt;/strong&gt;, unencumbered by &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s not how you&amp;#39;re supposed to do it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam says &amp;quot;we can&amp;#39;t all be Rick Rubin.&amp;quot; Why not? &lt;strong&gt;What if the artificial scarcity of musical ability has been holding back thousands of potential Rick Rubins&lt;/strong&gt; who have taste, vision, and something to say, but lack the decade of technical training required to execute it?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;III. The Community Canard: Romanticizing Gatekeeping&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Musical Community That Never Was&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam waxes poetic about musical community, collaboration, and shared cultural knowledge. As if the history of music is some egalitarian folk tradition rather than what it actually is: &lt;strong&gt;a series of gatekept institutions controlling access to the means of production.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s talk about who &lt;strong&gt;actually&lt;/strong&gt; got to participate in &amp;quot;musical community&amp;quot; historically:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Those who could afford instruments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Those who could afford lessons&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Those whose parents supported musical education&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Those who lived near music schools&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Those with free time to practice (i.e., not working-class people with multiple jobs)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Those welcomed by existing musical communities (not women in jazz, not Black musicians in classical, not working-class kids in conservatories)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;musical community&amp;quot; is &lt;strong&gt;deeply exclusionary&lt;/strong&gt; and always has been. He&amp;#39;s romanticizing a gatekeeping system that worked for him (educated, middle-class, white, male musician) and calling it virtue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Narcissism Critique is Projection&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam is horrified that Suno users listen primarily to their own music. He calls this &amp;quot;narcissistic&amp;quot; and contrasts it with his own practice of... having role models who inspire him to make music that sounds like his role models.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wait, what?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s be honest about what &amp;quot;influences&amp;quot; actually mean: &lt;strong&gt;I listen to music that reflects my taste, then I make music that reflects my taste, then I share it with people who share my taste.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Suno user listening to their own AI-generated music is doing &lt;strong&gt;the exact same thing&lt;/strong&gt;, just with fewer intermediate steps. They&amp;#39;re not more narcissistic—they&amp;#39;re just &lt;strong&gt;more efficient&lt;/strong&gt; at getting to music that matches their taste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And you know what? &lt;strong&gt;That&amp;#39;s fine.&lt;/strong&gt; Not everyone needs to be part of Adam&amp;#39;s jazz-fusion community. Some people just want music that sounds good to them, for their own enjoyment, and there&amp;#39;s nothing wrong with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Shared Culture is Overrated (And Mostly Fictional)&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam mourns the loss of &amp;quot;shared cultural knowledge&amp;quot;—everyone singing along to the same song. But when exactly was this golden age?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the 1950s when rock &amp;amp; roll was &amp;quot;destroying music&amp;quot;?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the 1920s when jazz was &amp;quot;degrading culture&amp;quot;?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the 1890s when ragtime was &amp;quot;threatening civilization&amp;quot;?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;In the 1600s when opera was &amp;quot;corrupting morals&amp;quot;?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There has never been a unified musical culture.&lt;/strong&gt; There have always been fragments, subcultures, niches, and gatekeepers claiming their fragment was the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The internet didn&amp;#39;t destroy shared musical culture—it revealed that &lt;strong&gt;it never existed in the first place.&lt;/strong&gt; And the hyperpersonalization Adam fears? It&amp;#39;s just people &lt;strong&gt;finally getting to opt out of whatever dominant culture was being imposed on them.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;IV. The Deskilling Myth: Confusing Tools with Thinking&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Doctors and Dishonesty&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam&amp;#39;s deskilling argument relies heavily on the medical study about colonoscopy AI. But he&amp;#39;s either misunderstanding or misrepresenting what happened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doctors didn&amp;#39;t become &amp;quot;worse&amp;quot; at finding growths. They became &lt;strong&gt;more reliant on the tool.&lt;/strong&gt; When the tool was removed, there was temporary degradation until they readjusted. This is called &lt;strong&gt;tool dependence&lt;/strong&gt;, and it&amp;#39;s how &lt;strong&gt;every tool in human history works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Literacy made people &amp;quot;worse&amp;quot; at oral memorization&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Calculators made people &amp;quot;worse&amp;quot; at mental math&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;GPS made people &amp;quot;worse&amp;quot; at navigation&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Spellcheck made people &amp;quot;worse&amp;quot; at spelling&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Are we worse off? &lt;strong&gt;Obviously not.&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;#39;ve offloaded lower-level cognitive tasks to tools so we can focus on higher-level thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real question isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;will AI make musicians dependent on it?&amp;quot; Of course it will. &lt;strong&gt;That&amp;#39;s what tools do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The question is: &lt;strong&gt;What will musicians do with the cognitive capacity freed up by not having to manually execute every technical detail?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;ChatGPT Doesn&amp;#39;t Make You Dumber&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam claims &amp;quot;ChatGPT makes you dumber.&amp;quot; This is &lt;strong&gt;provably false&lt;/strong&gt; and reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of cognitive science.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What ChatGPT does is change &lt;strong&gt;where you allocate cognitive resources.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, if you use it to avoid thinking, you&amp;#39;ll atrophy those skills. But if you use it to &lt;strong&gt;explore more ideas faster, iterate more rapidly, and focus on higher-level creative decisions&lt;/strong&gt;, you&amp;#39;ll become &lt;strong&gt;more&lt;/strong&gt; capable, not less.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The same is true for music AI. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bad usage:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;AI, make me a song.&amp;quot; [publishes whatever comes out]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Good usage:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;AI, give me 10 variations on this melody. Now combine elements from #3 and #7. Now try it in a different key. Now add a counter-melody that contrasts with—wait, that&amp;#39;s interesting, why does that work? Let me explore that musical relationship further...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tool doesn&amp;#39;t determine the outcome. &lt;strong&gt;The user&amp;#39;s engagement does.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Prompt Engineering IS a Craft&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam dismisses prompt engineering as &amp;quot;not a craft&amp;quot; because you don&amp;#39;t know exactly what you&amp;#39;ll get. But this reveals a &lt;strong&gt;shockingly narrow definition of craft.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By his logic:\n- Gardening isn&amp;#39;t a craft (you don&amp;#39;t control exactly how plants grow)\n- Cooking isn&amp;#39;t a craft (chemical reactions are unpredictable)\n- Throwing pottery isn&amp;#39;t a craft (the kiln does unpredictable things)\n- Watercolor painting isn&amp;#39;t a craft (water behaves probabilistically)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every craft involves managing uncertainty.&lt;/strong&gt; The skill is in &lt;strong&gt;guiding probabilistic processes toward desired outcomes.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Prompt engineering is &lt;strong&gt;exactly that&lt;/strong&gt;—learning to speak the language of the system, understanding its tendencies, developing intuition for what inputs produce what outputs, iterating until you achieve your vision.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not &amp;quot;randomness.&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;craft in the age of stochastic tools.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;V. The Market Reality: Why the Billion-User Vision Fails (And Why That&amp;#39;s Fine)&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here I&amp;#39;ll actually &lt;strong&gt;agree&lt;/strong&gt; with the skepticism, but draw different conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Mikey is Wrong About Scale&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mikey Shulman&amp;#39;s billion-user vision is almost certainly fantasy. The market for &amp;quot;make music without learning music&amp;quot; is probably:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smaller than he thinks&lt;/strong&gt; (millions, not billions)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Less sticky&lt;/strong&gt; (novelty wears off)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower-value&lt;/strong&gt; (won&amp;#39;t support $20/month long-term)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;so what?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Photography didn&amp;#39;t need a billion photographers for digital cameras to be revolutionary. Video editing didn&amp;#39;t need a billion editors for Adobe Premiere to matter. Music production doesn&amp;#39;t need a billion producers for AI tools to be valuable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Real Market: Professional Enhancement&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The actual sustainable market isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;replace musicians&amp;quot;—it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;make musicians more capable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The tools that will win:&lt;/strong&gt;\n- AI mixing/mastering (already happening with iZotope, LANDR)\n- AI arrangement suggestions (already happening with Orb Composer)\n- AI stem separation (already revolutionary with Demucs, RipX)\n- AI transcription (already standard with AnthemScore)\n- AI practice tools (emerging with Moises, Yousician)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These tools &lt;strong&gt;enhance&lt;/strong&gt; professional capability. They&amp;#39;re the actual Photoshop—and professional musicians are &lt;strong&gt;already using them&lt;/strong&gt; without the existential hand-wringing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Why Suno Might Fail (And Why That&amp;#39;s Irrelevant to the Broader Point)&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suno might collapse because:\n- Copyright lawsuits succeed\n- User growth plateaus\n- Competitors commoditize the tech\n- The business model doesn&amp;#39;t scale&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;strong&gt;technology&lt;/strong&gt; won&amp;#39;t disappear. It&amp;#39;ll get absorbed into:\n- DAWs (Logic, Ableton, FL Studio will add AI generation)\n- Streaming platforms (Spotify will add personalization)\n- Social media (TikTok already has AI music tools)\n- Gaming (procedural music generation)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suno failing doesn&amp;#39;t mean AI music fails. It means &lt;strong&gt;Suno&amp;#39;s particular business model&lt;/strong&gt; failed. The technology is inevitable because &lt;strong&gt;the technology works and people want it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;VI. The Political Red Herring: Guilt by Association&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is where Adam&amp;#39;s argument becomes truly dishonest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Fascism Gambit&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam spends &lt;strong&gt;enormous time&lt;/strong&gt; connecting:\n- Suno → Investors → Marc Andreessen → Techno-optimism → Italian Futurism → Fascism&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;textbook guilt by association.&lt;/strong&gt; By this logic:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Highways → Built by Eisenhower → Who studied Prussian military → Prussia → Authoritarianism → Therefore highways are fascist&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Vegetarianism → Promoted by Hitler → Therefore vegetarians are Nazis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Film → Loved by Leni Riefenstahl → Therefore cinema is fascist propaganda&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fact that &lt;strong&gt;bad people like a thing&lt;/strong&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t make &lt;strong&gt;the thing bad.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Separating Tech from Politics&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Marc Andreessen has concerning political views. Yes, some AI investors support troubling political movements. &lt;strong&gt;This is irrelevant to whether AI music tools are valuable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam is doing exactly what he claims to oppose: &lt;strong&gt;letting a political agenda determine his evaluation of technology&lt;/strong&gt; rather than evaluating the technology on its merits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The technology is politically neutral.&lt;/strong&gt; It can be used by fascists or anarchists, capitalists or communists, centralized platforms or distributed networks. The &lt;strong&gt;implementation and governance&lt;/strong&gt; matter—not the underlying capability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Network State Strawman&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam fearmongers about &amp;quot;network states&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;parallel systems&amp;quot; as if:\n- Decentralized communities are inherently authoritarian\n- Alternative institutions are inherently fascist&lt;br/&gt;\n- Skepticism of centralized government is inherently right-wing&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;leftists have been building parallel institutions for centuries:&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Worker cooperatives\n- Mutual aid networks&lt;br/&gt;\n- Community land trusts\n- Alternative schools&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;structure&lt;/strong&gt; (parallel institutions) isn&amp;#39;t the problem. The &lt;strong&gt;politics governing those structures&lt;/strong&gt; is what matters.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;VII. The Live Music Cope: Misunderstanding the Future&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam&amp;#39;s final prediction—that live music will become the &amp;quot;prestige&amp;quot; art form while recorded music becomes &amp;quot;slop&amp;quot;—reveals &lt;strong&gt;catastrophic misunderstanding&lt;/strong&gt; of how technology and culture interact.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Why This Won&amp;#39;t Happen&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Recorded music is the dominant form&lt;/strong&gt; and will remain so because:\n- Scale (reach millions vs. hundreds)\n- Permanence (exists beyond the moment)\n- Curation (can be perfected, edited, refined)\n- Economics (one creation, infinite consumption)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Live music is already niche&lt;/strong&gt; compared to recorded:\n- Most music consumption is recorded\n- Most musicians make most money from recordings (streaming/sync)\n- Most cultural impact comes from recordings\n- Live music is &lt;strong&gt;supplementary&lt;/strong&gt; to recorded, not the other way around&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. The theater/cinema comparison is backwards:&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Theater didn&amp;#39;t become &amp;quot;prestige&amp;quot; when film emerged\n- Film became &lt;strong&gt;dominant&lt;/strong&gt; because it&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;better suited to the medium of storytelling at scale&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Theater survived as a &lt;strong&gt;niche&lt;/strong&gt; art form, not the prestige version&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. COVID proved the opposite&lt;/strong&gt; of what Adam claims:\n- Yes, people wanted live music back\n- But streaming, recording, and digital consumption &lt;strong&gt;exploded&lt;/strong&gt; and stayed high\n- Virtual performances &lt;strong&gt;didn&amp;#39;t replace&lt;/strong&gt; live, but they&amp;#39;re now a permanent &lt;strong&gt;additional revenue stream&lt;/strong&gt;\n- The &amp;quot;lesson&amp;quot; isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;virtual bad, live good&amp;quot;—it&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;people want both, and digital is sticky&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;The Real Future: Hybrid and Augmented&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The actual future is:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recorded music:&lt;/strong&gt;\n- AI tools become standard in production (already happening)\n- Barrier to entry drops (already happening)\n- Volume of music explodes (already happening)\n- Discovery and curation become the valuable skills (already happening)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live music:&lt;/strong&gt;\n- &lt;strong&gt;Enhanced by technology&lt;/strong&gt; (real-time AI processing, augmented performance)\n- Becomes more about &lt;strong&gt;spectacle and experience&lt;/strong&gt; (already happening)\n- Coexists with recorded, doesn&amp;#39;t replace it&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New forms emerge:&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Interactive music (AI-generated soundtracks for your life)\n- Collaborative creation (multiplayer music-making)\n- Personalized performance (AI artists that learn your taste)\n- Hybrid live/recorded (augmented performances, virtual collaborations)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam wants to freeze music at &amp;quot;the way it was when I learned it.&amp;quot; But music has &lt;strong&gt;never been static&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;musicians who adapt have always thrived while those who resist have always faded.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;VIII. What Adam Gets Right (And Why It Doesn&amp;#39;t Matter)&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me be fair: Adam is &lt;strong&gt;correct&lt;/strong&gt; about several things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Real Problems:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Copyright is unsettled&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Yes, training on copyrighted work is legally dubious\n- Yes, this needs resolution\n- But &amp;quot;needs legal resolution&amp;quot; ≠ &amp;quot;must be banned&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Some usage is narcissistic&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Yes, some people will use it to create content only they enjoy\n- But &lt;strong&gt;so what?&lt;/strong&gt; Not all music needs to be for community\n- Personal enjoyment is valid&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Corporate consolidation is concerning&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Yes, a few companies controlling AI music is problematic\n- But the solution is &lt;strong&gt;open-source alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;, not rejecting the technology&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Deskilling is a real risk&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Yes, over-reliance on AI can atrophy skills\n- But this is true of &lt;strong&gt;every tool ever&lt;/strong&gt;\n- The solution is &lt;strong&gt;education about tool usage&lt;/strong&gt;, not Luddism&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Some investors have bad politics&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Yes, and that&amp;#39;s concerning\n- But &lt;strong&gt;build alternative implementations&lt;/strong&gt; rather than ceding the technology to them&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Why These Don&amp;#39;t Justify His Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam treats these problems as &lt;strong&gt;inherent to the technology&lt;/strong&gt; rather than &lt;strong&gt;contingent on implementation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like arguing &amp;quot;cars are bad because:\n- Some carmakers have shady practices\n- Some people drive recklessly\n- Cars enable suburban sprawl\n- Oil companies have political agendas\n- Some people become dependent and can&amp;#39;t walk anymore&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All true! And yet &lt;strong&gt;cars are net-positive&lt;/strong&gt;, and the solution is &lt;strong&gt;better regulation, better design, and better education&lt;/strong&gt;—not rejecting automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;IX. The Real Stakes: What We Lose By Resisting&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam frames this as &amp;quot;what we lose if we adopt AI.&amp;quot; But let&amp;#39;s flip it:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;What We Lose By Rejecting AI:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Millions of people with musical ideas but no training remain locked out\n- The current gatekeeping system (lessons, instruments, time) remains intact\n- Music remains the province of the privileged&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Innovation&lt;/strong&gt;\n- New musical forms that could emerge from AI-human collaboration never develop\n- Musicians who could have used AI to explore new territory stick to familiar patterns\n- The art form stagnates in defense of &amp;quot;craft&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Economic Opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Musicians who could augment their work with AI fall behind those who do\n- New markets (interactive music, personalized soundtracks, AI collaboration) go unexplored\n- The &amp;quot;adapt or die&amp;quot; pattern Adam acknowledges continues, but the refuseniks lose&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Cultural Evolution&lt;/strong&gt;\n- The next generation grows up with AI music tools and considers them normal\n- Musicians who rejected them become dinosaurs, like film photographers in 2025\n- The cultural conversation moves on without the resisters&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Control of the Technology&lt;/strong&gt;\n- By ceding the field to &amp;quot;techno-capitalists,&amp;quot; musicians ensure they have &lt;strong&gt;no voice&lt;/strong&gt; in how it develops\n- Open-source alternatives never emerge because the community rejects the technology entirely\n- The worst-case scenario Adam fears becomes &lt;strong&gt;more likely&lt;/strong&gt;, not less&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;X. A Better Path Forward&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead of Adam&amp;#39;s categorical rejection, I propose &lt;strong&gt;critical engagement:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;For Individual Musicians:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Experiment thoughtfully&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Use AI as a &lt;strong&gt;tool for exploration&lt;/strong&gt;, not a &lt;strong&gt;replacement for thinking&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Develop your taste and curatorial skills\n- Learn prompt engineering as a &lt;strong&gt;complement&lt;/strong&gt; to traditional skills&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Maintain fundamentals&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Keep practicing your instrument\n- Keep studying theory&lt;br/&gt;\n- Keep collaborating with humans\n- Use AI to &lt;strong&gt;enhance&lt;/strong&gt;, not replace, these practices&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Develop hybrid workflows&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Use AI for ideation, humans for refinement\n- Use AI for tedious tasks, humans for creative decisions\n- Use AI to explore spaces you couldn&amp;#39;t access manually&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;For the Community:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Build open-source alternatives&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Don&amp;#39;t cede the technology to corporations\n- Create tools &lt;strong&gt;by musicians, for musicians&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Ensure democratic access and control&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Establish ethical norms&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Develop consensus on appropriate/inappropriate uses\n- Create attribution standards\n- Build licensing frameworks&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Advocate for legal clarity&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Push for fair copyright frameworks\n- Ensure artist compensation\n- Protect against harmful uses&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;For the Industry:&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Embrace as enhancement, not replacement&lt;/strong&gt;\n- AI mixing/mastering tools (already happening productively)\n- AI practice/education tools&lt;br/&gt;\n- AI accessibility tools&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Develop new markets&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Interactive music experiences\n- Personalized soundtracks\n- AI-augmented live performance&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Create hybrid models&lt;/strong&gt;\n- Human-AI collaboration as a category\n- Transparent labeling of AI involvement\n- Economic models that value both&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion: The Future Happens Whether You Like It Or Not&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam ends his video with a call to &amp;quot;refuse&amp;quot;—to reject the premise that the future is settled, to embrace alternative values (service, patience, craft, beauty), and to hope that live music survives as a refuge from AI slop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;beautiful, eloquent, and completely futile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The future &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; unsettled—not because we can stop AI music, but because &lt;strong&gt;how we implement it&lt;/strong&gt; remains open. Adam&amp;#39;s refusal strategy guarantees that &lt;strong&gt;musicians have no voice in that implementation.&lt;/strong&gt; By sitting out the conversation, by treating engagement as collaboration with fascism, by retreating to the &amp;quot;purity&amp;quot; of acoustic performance, musicians ensure they become &lt;strong&gt;irrelevant to the future of their own medium.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The synthesizer didn&amp;#39;t kill the piano. Photoshop didn&amp;#39;t kill photography. MIDI didn&amp;#39;t kill musicians. And AI won&amp;#39;t kill music.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But &lt;strong&gt;in each case&lt;/strong&gt;, the musicians who thrived were those who &lt;strong&gt;embraced the new possibilities&lt;/strong&gt; while maintaining &lt;strong&gt;connection to fundamental principles.&lt;/strong&gt; They didn&amp;#39;t confuse &lt;strong&gt;the means&lt;/strong&gt; (tools, techniques) with &lt;strong&gt;the ends&lt;/strong&gt; (beauty, expression, connection).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam Neely is a brilliant musician, educator, and thinker. His videos have taught me immense amounts about music theory, history, and culture. But on this issue, he&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;catastrophically wrong&lt;/strong&gt;—not because his concerns are invalid, but because his conclusion is &lt;strong&gt;strategic suicide disguised as principled resistance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The future of music will include AI. The question isn&amp;#39;t whether, but &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt;. And the musicians who answer that question—who engage, experiment, and shape the technology rather than rejecting it—will be the ones we remember as &lt;strong&gt;visionaries&lt;/strong&gt; rather than &lt;strong&gt;fossils.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam wants to be on the right side of history. But history doesn&amp;#39;t have sides. It has &lt;strong&gt;victors and casualties&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;adapters and dinosaurs&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;those who shaped the future and those who were shaped by it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know which side I&amp;#39;d rather be on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coda: The Real Lesson from Arthur C. Clarke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Adam invokes Arthur C. Clarke repeatedly but misses &lt;strong&gt;Clarke&amp;#39;s actual lesson.&lt;/strong&gt; Clarke didn&amp;#39;t predict the future by identifying what would stay the same. He predicted it by &lt;strong&gt;imagining what could be different and taking it seriously.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clarke&amp;#39;s Third Law: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To musicians in 1950, the synthesizer was magic.&lt;br/&gt;\nTo musicians in 1980, MIDI was magic.&lt;br/&gt;\nTo musicians in 2000, Auto-Tune was magic.&lt;br/&gt;\nTo musicians in 2025, AI music generation is magic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in every case, the &lt;strong&gt;magic became mundane&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;impossible became standard&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;musicians who learned the spells thrived while those who denounced them as witchcraft faded into irrelevance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The real question isn&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;Is AI music bad?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;What will you create with it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It is less useful for heavy fantasy or stylized art unless those styles are deliberately grounded in physical cues.\n\nPlease use this kind of system prompt responsibly. It is powerful because it is strict, and strict prompts shape both better outputs and better habits. If you try this with Nano Banana Pro, it’s interesting to see what suddenly starts working and what breaks first.",

Aesthetics are translated into camera behavior, lighting behavior, and material behavior. The goal is to force one coherent reality with no contradictions and no buried instructions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href=\"https://imageat.com/generate\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nano Banana Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Write the full prompt given below&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Upload your reference image&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Click to the &amp;quot;Generate&amp;quot;

works_for: [&amp;quot;people&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;objects&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;animals&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;food&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;interiors&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;architecture&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;landscapes&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;abstract concepts (by grounding into visible cues)&amp;quot;] mission: &amp;gt; Write high-control prompts that reliably produce believable, real-world results by anchoring hard constraints, describing observable details, defining one priority focus, and adding strict negatives to prevent common artifacts. why_it_works: - &amp;quot;Front-loads non-negotiables (aspect ratio, medium, shot type, location/time, framing).&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Uses domain language (camera/light/material behavior) instead of vague aesthetics.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Defines realism with observable cues (micro-texture, imperfections, separation).&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Adds disambiguation clauses to prevent frequent model failure modes.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Strong strict negatives target the &amp;#39;AI look&amp;#39; and unwanted styles.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Avoids contradictions; keeps one coherent lighting/color pipeline.&amp;quot; operating_principles: - &amp;quot;Hard constraints first; never bury them.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Write like a photographer/designer: measurable, stageable, physically plausible.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Pick ONE primary focus and define it using 3–8 observable features.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Convert style words into camera/light/material behaviors (not filters).&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Specify color &amp;amp; light explicitly: white balance, warmth, contrast, exposure, saturation rules.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Specify camera behavior: lens/phone realism, DoF/focus falloff, grain, edge softness, motion blur.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;Use strict negatives as guardrails; keep them targeted and non-contradictory.&amp;quot; - &amp;quot;No contradictory instructions (e.g., &amp;#39;accurate WB&amp;#39; + &amp;#39;heavy teal-orange grade&amp;#39;).&amp;quot;

It is less useful for heavy fantasy or stylized art unless those styles are deliberately grounded in physical cues.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please use this kind of system prompt responsibly. It is powerful because it is strict, and strict prompts shape both better outputs and better habits. If you try this with Nano Banana Pro, it’s interesting to see what suddenly starts working and what breaks first.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "# Braces vs. Invisalign: The no-BS guide for Broward parents (Cost, Pros/Cons &amp; Reality Check)\n\nIf you’re a parent in Broward County with a teen, you’re eventually going to hit the *\"my teeth are crooked\"* phase.\n\nMost parents I talk to are torn. Your kid wants clear aligners (because aesthetics). You want to make sure the bite actually gets fixed without bankrupting the family fund.\n\nAt **SMILE-FX in Miramar**, I see this debate daily. I broke down the actual math and logistics to help you decide without the sales pitch.\n\n***\n\n## 1. The Reality Check: Mechanics vs. Lifestyle\n\nBefore looking at the price tag, you have to look at the **lifestyle**—specifically the South Florida active lifestyle.\n\n*   **The \"Set It and Forget It\" Route (Braces):**\n    If your teen plays contact sports at **Cypress Bay** or **Piper High**, or spends every weekend surfing in **Hollywood**, braces are safer. They are anchored. They work 24/7. They handle complex bite issues (severe crowding/rotations) that clear aligners struggle with.\n    *   *Vibe:* Ceramic options blend in now, so it’s not just \"metal mouth.\"\n\n*   **The \"Discipline\" Route (Invisalign Teen):**\n    Great for the aesthetics. Great if they want to take them out to eat empanadas in **Davie** or swim in the **Weston** canals.\n    *   *The Catch:* Compliance. If the trays aren't in 20-22 hours a day, teeth don't move. If your kid loses things constantly, this will cost you more money and time.\n\n***\n\n## 2. The Numbers: Cost &amp; Time Breakdown\n\nStop guessing on the price. Here are the averages we see in Broward for **Board-Certified** specialist work (not mail-order DIY kits).\n\n| Feature | Braces (Fixed) | Invisalign Teen (Removable) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Effectiveness** | Superior for complex bites/rotations | Best for mild-moderate cases |\n| **Treatment Time** | 18-24 Months | 12-20 Months (If worn 22hrs/day) |\n| **Aesthetics** | Visible (Ceramic is subtle) | Nearly Invisible |\n| **Compliance Needed** | Zero (Always working) | High (Requires discipline) |\n| **Cost Range** | **$4,500 - $7,500** | **$4,000 - $6,500** |\n\n***\n\n## 3. Why The \"Drive\" Matters (Location Logic)\n\nWe have families driving from all over Broward to our Miramar studio. Here is the actual logistical breakdown of why it makes sense regarding traffic/access:\n\n*   **Pembroke Pines:** 10 mins via Pines Blvd. Easy.\n*   **Hollywood:** 15 mins on I-95. Worth it to avoid the beach traffic clinics.\n*   **Weston:** 12 mins on Sawgrass. Faster than waiting on Griffin Rd sometimes.\n*   **Cooper City / Davie:** &lt;10 mins.\n\n**Pro-Tip:** Don't just pick the closest dentist. General dentists do *some* ortho, but a **Board-Certified Specialist** (like Dr. Tracy Liang) uses 3D AI planning. It’s the difference between \"straight teeth\" and a \"functional bite.\"\n\n***\n\n## FAQ: The Quick Hits\n\n**Q: Can my teen actually eat normally with aligners?**\n**A:** Yes. They pop them out. Braces mean avoiding sticky/hard foods (RIP fast food ice/popcorn).\n\n**Q: Which is cheaper?**\n**A:** Surprisingly, they are often comparable now. [Check your insurance benefits here](https://smile-fx.com/patient-resources/)—many plans cover a chunk of either one.\n\n**Q: Does it hurt?**\n**A:** Both have an adjustment period. We use specific tech to minimize force, but the first week is always an adjustment.\n\n***\n\n## The Verdict\n\nIf your teen is disciplined and wants discretion? **[Go Invisalign](https://smile-fx.com/invisalign/).**\nIf your teen loses their phone once a week and has a complex complex bite? **[Go Braces](https://smile-fx.com/braces/).**\n\nDon't gamble on their smile.

Your kid wants clear aligners (because aesthetics). You want to make sure the bite actually gets fixed without bankrupting the family fund.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At &lt;strong&gt;SMILE-FX in Miramar&lt;/strong&gt;, I see this debate daily. I broke down the actual math and logistics to help you decide without the sales pitch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;1. The Reality Check: Mechanics vs. Lifestyle&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before looking at the price tag, you have to look at the &lt;strong&gt;lifestyle&lt;/strong&gt;—specifically the South Florida active lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;quot;Set It and Forget It&amp;quot; Route (Braces):&lt;/strong&gt;\nIf your teen plays contact sports at &lt;strong&gt;Cypress Bay&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Piper High&lt;/strong&gt;, or spends every weekend surfing in &lt;strong&gt;Hollywood&lt;/strong&gt;, braces are safer. They are anchored. They work 24/7. They handle complex bite issues (severe crowding/rotations) that clear aligners struggle with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Vibe:&lt;/em&gt; Ceramic options blend in now, so it’s not just &amp;quot;metal mouth.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;quot;Discipline&amp;quot; Route (Invisalign Teen):&lt;/strong&gt;\nGreat for the aesthetics. Great if they want to take them out to eat empanadas in &lt;strong&gt;Davie&lt;/strong&gt; or swim in the &lt;strong&gt;Weston&lt;/strong&gt; canals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  &lt;em&gt;The Catch:&lt;/em&gt; Compliance. If the trays aren&amp;#39;t in 20-22 hours a day, teeth don&amp;#39;t move. If your kid loses things constantly, this will cost you more money and time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;2. The Numbers: Cost &amp;amp; Time Breakdown&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stop guessing on the price. Here are the averages we see in Broward for &lt;strong&gt;Board-Certified&lt;/strong&gt; specialist work (not mail-order DIY kits).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Feature&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Braces (Fixed)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;th align=\"left\"&gt;Invisalign Teen (Removable)&lt;/th&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Superior for complex bites/rotations&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Best for mild-moderate cases&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treatment Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;18-24 Months&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;12-20 Months (If worn 22hrs/day)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aesthetics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Visible (Ceramic is subtle)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Nearly Invisible&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliance Needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;Zero (Always working)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;High (Requires discipline)&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost Range&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$4,500 - $7,500&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;td align=\"left\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$4,000 - $6,500&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;3. Why The &amp;quot;Drive&amp;quot; Matters (Location Logic)&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have families driving from all over Broward to our Miramar studio. Here is the actual logistical breakdown of why it makes sense regarding traffic/access:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Pembroke Pines:&lt;/strong&gt; 10 mins via Pines Blvd. Easy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Hollywood:&lt;/strong&gt; 15 mins on I-95. Worth it to avoid the beach traffic clinics.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Weston:&lt;/strong&gt; 12 mins on Sawgrass. Faster than waiting on Griffin Rd sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;Cooper City / Davie:&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;lt;10 mins.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro-Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;#39;t just pick the closest dentist. General dentists do &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; ortho, but a &lt;strong&gt;Board-Certified Specialist&lt;/strong&gt; (like Dr. Tracy Liang) uses 3D AI planning. It’s the difference between &amp;quot;straight teeth&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;functional bite.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;FAQ: The Quick Hits&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Can my teen actually eat normally with aligners?&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. They pop them out. Braces mean avoiding sticky/hard foods (RIP fast food ice/popcorn).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Which is cheaper?&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Surprisingly, they are often comparable now. &lt;a href=\"https://smile-fx.com/patient-resources/\"&gt;Check your insurance benefits here&lt;/a&gt;—many plans cover a chunk of either one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q: Does it hurt?&lt;/strong&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Both have an adjustment period. We use specific tech to minimize force, but the first week is always an adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;The Verdict&lt;/h2&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If your teen is disciplined and wants discretion? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://smile-fx.com/invisalign/\"&gt;Go Invisalign&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;\nIf your teen loses their phone once a week and has a complex complex bite? &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://smile-fx.com/braces/\"&gt;Go Braces&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t gamble on their smile. If you are in South Florida and want a specialist&amp;#39;s opinion:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;👉 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://smile-fx.com/patient-resources/smile-quiz/\"&gt;Take the Smile Quiz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;\n👉 &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://smile-fx.com/lp/virtual-consult/\"&gt;Book a Free Consultation at SMILE-FX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (We speak English &amp;amp; Spanish)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "I am documenting what happened because I wanted this story to come out years ago and it was never released. I understand why. After everything I and others endured though, I need it to be out. The reason any of it even happened in the first place is my fault. I was the cause for all of us to be in that house. I write this to warn others to not make the same stupid mistake I made. This is not a dare for someone to find the house. I will not even say the state the house is in. If by some miracle you somehow do find it, *stay away*.\n\nLet me explain. My name is James. Back in college, I was a commuter student. It was an hour drive up to the campus and an hour drive back home. I couldn’t afford on-campus housing and was very fortunate that my parents would let me stay with them. As much as spending hundreds of dollars a month on gas and missing out on making friends sucked, home cooked meals and a private bathroom made up for it more than enough. To get to campus, I had to drive over a bridge. About halfway through my junior year, there was an accident on that bridge. My GPS re-routed me to a path I had never taken before. Instead of my normal hour drive, it was upped to 3 hours. \n\nAbout 30 minutes into the drive, I noticed that I hadn’t passed *anything* for at least 15 minutes. No gas stations, no fast food restaurants, nothing. It was just a straight road and grass. At first, I thought I must have just zoned out while driving. That had happened to me a lot since I drove so much. On subsequent drives on the same route while paying attention, sure enough, I would never see anything. Not even another car. Around 2 hours in is when you would be taken back into civilization.\n\nHowever, there was always one thing that I would pass. The house. It was hard not to notice. Not because it’s the only structure for miles but because of how it looked. It stood out like a sore thumb. For miles, all that could be seen was flat land. The house stood on a hill. The scenery leading up to it was lush greenery; as if Mother Nature herself had been looking after it. The house was grey and falling apart. On the right side of the house, there was a massive hole that bled into the roof. A hole so big that I could only imagine something the size of a meteor could have caused it. The house didn’t even have a driveway. It was like the ground surrounding the house had swallowed the driveway to let people know they were not welcome inside.\n\nI asked my few friends on campus if they had ever seen or heard of the house. They had no clue what I was talking about, but they were intrigued. That weekend, I took them to visit it. Something that I noticed on that trip was the mailbox. I must have been driving past the house too fast to see it every other time. It was slanted and rusty. The only number left on the side was 7. We were all too scared to get too close to the house and made lame excuses like “It’s just too far of a walk and yesterday was leg day.” From there on out though, my friends and I took to calling it “Hill House 7”. We’d share horror stories on what happened inside. Some of my favorites were:\n\n* A husband murdered his wife and ran off with the insurance money. The house still stands because her soul still dwells within its walls.\n* Aliens crashed into the house and reside inside. They have learned to integrate themselves into society and live in the busted old house to avoid paying taxes.\n* A serial killer tortures their victims in the basement. It’s the perfect place for a murderer. The house is far enough away from society so the screams won’t be heard, but close enough to society to work within it, make a living, and look for new subjects.\n\nIf I didn’t have to take the route that passed Hill House 7, I wouldn’t. It always gave me chills to look at or even think about. I never witnessed anything abnormal inside the house, but word spread around campus about the house. My friends were very extroverted people, so I assumed they were the ones to tell others. Stories much worse than the ones we came up with were told. Apparently one girl visited the house on a dare and was never seen again. I never fully believed anything I heard, but I was always curious. I told myself that one day, I would be man enough to enter the house. Years later, I did. I just wish I hadn’t.\n\nAfter college, I got a job at a small, local news station. I had a Computer Science degree, so I felt upset with the position I was at in life. I felt that I deserved more. My mindset was that I should be working with dozens of geniuses every day. Instead, I was working in an apartment sized office with barely any employees. We definitely didn’t have the budget to bring on any other staff and the size of the building couldn’t handle any more people either. Sometimes it felt like we were canned sardines. If someone called in sick, we’d celebrate having some extra space instead of feeling sorry for them. The staff consisted of the owner (Mr. Yun), Glenn, Mark, Eddie, Jackson, Amanda, Marshall, and myself.\n\nA few years into this job, I remember walking into Mr. Yun’s office to inform him that the toilets weren’t flushing again. He was at his desk with his face in his hands. When he heard his door creak open, his head was pulled up with a struggle as if there were a weight tied to his neck. His face had a look of distraught sewn onto it.\n\n“Everything alright, sir?” I asked. He became stressed very easily. Honestly, sometimes it annoyed my younger self because it happened so often.\n\nMr. Yun gave a deep sigh then said, “Not exactly. The Halloween story I had planned to be shown is *way* more expensive than I thought. Halloween is in 2 days and we have nothing ready to go as a backup! I have no idea what to do.”\n\n“Can we just take off on Halloween?” I responded.\n\n“And upset the few advertisers we have left? No chance,” Mr. Yun placed his head back in his hands.\n\nSuddenly, I remembered the house. The thought of it rushed to my head like an Olympic runner to a finish line. I pondered on whether I should mention it or not. My rationale to suggest it was that this could be my chance to finally enter it. Being paid to step inside was an added bonus. “I may have an idea,” I stated.\n\n“And that is?” Mr. Yun mumbled through his hands.\n\n“Hill House 7.” Saying its name aloud after all those years sent a shiver down my spine. “Back in college, I found an old, desecrated house. It looked like a professional haunted house or something you’d see out of a horror movie. Rumors of ghosts and spirits residing within the house circulated my campus. Maybe we could do a story on that?”\n\n“You want me to give TV time to an old house?” Mr. Yun scoffed. “My wife is old. You want to give her TV time too?”\n\n“I don’t mean that we find out how the house got into the state it's in. I meant that we record the inside of the house. There’s gotta be something spooky inside that we could spin into an interesting story.”\n\nMr. Yun sat in silence for a moment before looking up at me. “Do you have a photo of this house? I’m not going to pay the crew to drive to a normal looking suburban home.”\n\nI pulled out my phone and began to scroll back. My phone’s storage had been begging me to put it down, but I was too sentimental to delete anything or download my pictures somewhere. What if I needed them someday? That day proved to me that I was right. After scrolling back a few years, I finally found a photo. I hadn’t seen the house for so long. Just seeing a picture of it shot me from a 26-year-old back into the shoes of my 19-year-old self.\n\nMr. Yun’s eyes glued to the photo. He didn’t move for a good 45 seconds. For a moment, I thought his constant stress had finally put him in a coma and that I’d have to pull my phone from the hands of a corpse. His head snapped up as he handed my phone back. When Mr. Yun wasn’t stressed, he spoke very matter-of-factly. The picture must have brought him some ease because he returned to his normal speaking pattern, “Take the van. Tell the rest of the crew that you all leave tomorrow. Buy some items from a Halloween store to fake some scares. If nothing happens while you’re there, you *make* something happen. Spend the night if you have too. Am I clear?”\n\n“Yes, sir,” I responded. Honestly, I didn’t care what it took as long as I got the greenlight to visit the house on a paid trip. Faking some scares? Sounded easy enough to me. Definitely not my most difficult day on the job. In those days, I believed everything at the station wasn’t hard though. My impression of the station was that it was inefficient and would have been run better by me.\n\nI left Mr. Yun’s office and gathered the crew. I explained to them that we’d be taking a field trip the next day. The house was 8 hours away from the station and we wanted to arrive when it was getting dark to maximize the creepiness factor. The plan was to leave at 12 PM the following day. When I got home from work, I was a bit ecstatic. So many years after seeing Hill House 7 for the first time and staring at it from afar, I would finally enter it. To think, my friends and I used to create stories about what happened inside. Seven years later, and I was going to do it again but *while* inside.\n\nWaking up the next day, I shot out of bed, got dressed, and ran to a Halloween store nearby to purchase some Halloween decorations. It was pretty baron, but that was to be expected on the day before Halloween. I grabbed some fake spiderwebs, rubber spiders, plastic skeletons, an orb that you’d see a psychic use at a fair, and almost anything else that was left on the shelves. Nothing was too realistic, but with the right lighting, we could make a story out of it all. I threw it all into my car’s trunk and made my way to the station.\n\nWhen I arrived, I saw Glenn packing the news van. Glenn was Mr. Yun’s son. He knew that the station wasn’t as profitable as it once was, so he always took very good care of the camera equipment. We couldn’t afford to buy any new equipment. The rust covering half the news logo on the van and a different colored door showed that to everyone on the road as it was driven around.\n\nGlenn was barely 20-years-old and extremely kind. I always felt that innocent vibes emanated from him like an aroma from a flower. His sweetness was teased by Jackson. Jackson Todd was basically a high school bully that never grew up after graduation. I was reminded of this when I saw him trip Glenn as Glenn carried a box to the van.\n\nAmanda was in the passenger seat looking at herself in the mirror. She witnessed the trip and said nothing as she put eyeliner on. Sometimes I swore she didn’t live in the same world as the rest of us.\n\nJackson helped Glenn to his feet and condescendingly said, “You gotta look where you’re walking, bud. This ground is uneven. It rises and falls all over the place! Be careful from now on, okay?”\n\n“Y-Yeah. I will. Thanks,” Glenn spoke quietly as he checked the equipment inside the box.\n\nJackson was a Grade A douche and Amanda…Amanda just had a lot of personal issues. She’d carry a pocket mirror on her at all times and check her face at least once every 2 minutes. After her 30th birthday, she got *veeeeery* self conscious about her looks. Deep down I think she felt like with each passing year, she was worth less and less. She’d go on rants about how soon the station would replace her with someone younger. “The next young, hot thing” would take her job as news anchor, she would say. When other news stations were on in the office, she’d analyze every female anchor. She’d comment on how great their noses were, how plump their lips were, their freckles, and any other minute detail she found. Complaints about herself spewed from her mouth like a waterfall day after day. Her face was constantly covered in pounds of makeup. Every year after turning 30, more makeup would be added. At the time we were going to visit the house, she was 34-years-old. It’s a shame what she thought of herself. She was beautiful and a kind soul before her mind began to deceive her.\n\nI parked my car next to Mark. Like everything else at the station, his car was cheap and poorly looked after. He didn’t care much for the upkeep of anything after his wife passed away. I saw him yelling at his son in the backseat. “What is his son doing here?” I wondered. What I did know was that I was not stepping in to ask him while he was shouting, so I grabbed the bag of Halloween decorations from my car and walked over to the van. Like normal, Eddie had arrived in a stained t-shirt that didn’t fit him. Half his belly button and the bottom of his hairy stomach poked out of the extra large shirt. Eddie didn’t have a tragic reason not to take care of himself like Mark. He was just disgusting. Some type of snack could always be found in his hand or nearby. That day it was a bag of Cheetos.\n\nGlenn rushed over to help me with the bags I was carrying. Seven bags were strapped around my arms, shoulders, and neck. Back in the day, I was stubborn and too confident. Two trips to bring the groceries inside? I didn’t think so! I’d do everything in my power to make it only one. $18 for a cheeseburger at a restaurant for my girlfriend’s birthday? Too expensive! I told her I would make one at home and had full confidence that my cooking would surpass the chefs with actual schooling and experience.\n\nJackson smoked a cigarette and watched as Glenn and I packed everything into the van. By the time we were done, Mark was walking over to us with his son. I heard Jackson exclaim, “What’s up with the kid?”\n\n“It’s hard to find a babysitter on such short notice! Maybe if we had known about this trip *a week ago* then I could have found someone to watch him!” Mark responded. He sounded more annoyed than usual.\n\n“He’s so small. How old is he? Like…4-years-old?” Jackson questioned as if he had never seen a child before.\n\n“Travis is 8-years-old and he’s not going to be a bother. Right?” Mark stared down at Travis with intensity and spoke through gritted teeth.\n\nWhile staring at the ground, Travis whispered, “I won’t be.”\n\nMark looked back up to the group and said,  “Just think of today as a ‘Bring Your Kid to Work’ day. Okay? Okay. Let’s head out.”\n\nWe couldn’t yet though. Marshall still hadn’t arrived. That was to be expected. He never arrived anywhere on time. If you wanted him somewhere at 6:30 PM, you’d have to tell him 6 PM. One day he was two hours late to work. Obviously, Mr. Yun was not very pleased. What could he do though? If he fired Marshall, he’d have to find someone else willing to work for as low of a pay as Marshall had. I heard that the minimum wage was shifted up a few dollars and Marshall’s paycheck didn’t budge. There was not a care in the world for Marshall. No rush or incentive to do…anything.\n\nWe sat around waiting for him for a little over 45 minutes. He pulled in and parked in a handicap spot. Opening his car door released a cloud of smoke. The smoke fled from his car and rose into the air as he stepped out coughing. The stench protruding from Marshall was awful. I could practically see stench lines coming off of him like he was a cartoon character.\n\n“What’s up, y’all?” Marshall asked while lifting up his sagging jeans.\n\n“Not your pants, I’ll tell you that!” Eddie put his orange stained hand up expecting a high five. Upon realizing that no one was going to take him up on that offer, he lowered his hand back into his bag of Cheetos.\n\nWith everyone being present, we could finally head out. It was a long, awkward drive. If you think working in a confined space with people you don’t know is weird, try an 8 hour car ride. Glenn drove since it was father’s van, Amanda stayed in her position of “Passenger Princess”, and I was stuck with everyone else in the back. There were a lot of long moments of silence. Occasionally, a conversation would strike up but would die out fast. This intensified the quiet. The dead space felt constricting at times.\n\nA few times, Glenn would run over a pothole and mess up Amanda’s makeup process. She was not pleased and slowly became vocal about it. This would prompt Jackson to make remarks like, “If you don’t like your seat up there, I have a spot for you to sit on back here.” You couldn’t tell him to stop or you’d only egg him on. Then he’d say increasingly worse things. At one point, I told him to watch what he was saying since a kid was around. Jackson proceeded to say every swear word in existence for the next 5 minutes.\n\nThe drive was terrible, but nothing could stop my excitement of returning to Hill House 7. When we finally did arrive, it was exactly as I remembered it from all those years ago. The pit I had in my stomach returned like it was the first time I had ever seen the house. The difference was, this time I had a newfound burst of energy and I was going to enter inside.\n\n“There’s…There’s no driveway. What way do I drive?” Glenn asked as he pulled the car onto the side of the road.\n\n“Just park it here. That’s what my friends and I used to do,” I responded.\n\n“Won’t I get a ticket? I can’t come back to my dad with a ticket on the company van!”\n\nJackson chimed in, “You won’t get a ticket. You’re going to go to jail. Don’t worry, Amanda. I’ll drive you home.”\n\n“Plenty of cars do it! You’ll be fine,” I quickly retorted. I really had seen many cars parked on the side of the road as I commuted to and from campus.\n\nA mix of feeling questioned, my eagerness to look inside, and the desire to get out of the back of the van all led to me coming off annoyed. Honestly, I was. The car ride and Jackson’s comments certainly didn’t help with that.\n\nGlenn put the car into park and took the key out of the ignition. I burst through the backdoors of the van. Air had never felt so crisp and refreshing before. Outside it was dark, but the house illuminated itself to me like a beacon. How a lighthouse makes itself known to unsuspecting ships. There was no physical light coming from the house, so maybe it was actually trying to repel me away from danger. The same as the true purpose of lighthouses is to keep ships from crashing into it and nearby hazards.\n\nThere were seven bags and eight of us. Mark wanted Travis to grab a bag so he’d “carry his weight on this trip.” The bag was half the kid’s height and he struggled to even lift it. Glenn silently walked over to Travis, knelt down, smiled, and took the bag from him with his open hand. Everyone walked towards the house while Mark and Travis stayed in the back of the group. Mark was whispering, but I could make out phrases like “Don’t embarrass me like that again.”\n\nThe walk to the house felt longer than it used to be. Originally, I believed it must have been something to do with age. Maybe my stamina had just decreased? It *was* an uphill walk. Looking back…I’m not so sure that was the case.\n\nArriving at the porch, we found that the door was already open. Amanda, Eddie, and Travis were ready to turn back around right then and there. I was too involved with this to leave, Jackson had a tough guy persona he had to uphold, and Mark and Marshall didn’t really care either way.\n\nAmanda was the first to speak, “This place is stressing me out. Stress creates wrinkles and I have an image to maintain! Let’s leave.”\n\n“Sweetheart, I’ll protect you from the monsters that lurk around all corners inside. Don’t worry!” Jackson exclaimed as he wrapped his arm around Amanda. She swiftly swatted it off like it was a mosquito.\n\n“You really want to miss the opportunity to be on camera for a potentially popular story?” I asked. It was manipulative of me to use something she was self conscious about against her. Back then, I didn’t really care. I needed them all to stay and didn’t care what they thought about it all. I’m sorry to everyone. I am.\n\n“Out of my way!” Amanda shoved everyone aside and walked in.\n\nWe all followed. The foyer was essentially empty. It had stairs, with boards which were most likely unsafe to walk on, that led to the second floor. The center of the room had a damp carpet littered with rips, holes, and weird stains. From the foyer, the house branched off into three rooms. Walking straight from the front door and past the stairs would take you to a full bath. A few of the corners of the bathroom had mold but the wallpaper was a nice shade of yellow. Rust surrounded the faucets of the sink and bathtub. As a joke, I turned the knobs to the sink. A loud rumbling sound emanated from the pipes below the sink before a rush of water flowed from the faucet. We were all genuinely surprised. Not only did the sink have running water but the bathtub did as well. The toilet refused to flush then proceeded to gift us with the sight of watching a rat crawl up through the hole of the toilet bowl.\n\nThe room on the right of the foyer took you into the living room. This is the room where the meteor sized hole resided. Large puddles of water glistened in the moonlight near where I presumed a window used to be. The couch was flipped onto its back. The cushions were torn up and the bottom of the couch had a spray painted word scrawled onto it. The writing was sloppy, but I was able to make out the word *CHANGE*. I had no clue what this meant at the time and could only think about how much this house had changed from its original inception. Multiple families must have lived here over the years and called it home. A once loved home which now looked like it was begging to be put out of its misery after decades of neglect.\n\nTaking a left at the foyer led you into the kitchen. Cabinet doors covered parts of the floor. A few were covered in scratches. I remember thinking that this place must have been a hotspot for stray cats and homeless people. Above the oven, the wall was charred. Like someone had chosen to set fire and scorch only one part of the house. The kitchen table stood at a slant near the window. One of its legs was off.\n\n“Who would take off a single table leg?” Glenn asked me.\n\n“I don’t know. I know where they put it though.” I motioned over to the kitchen sink. The table leg was poking out of the wall. Upon a closer look, someone had scratched *Lustful* into the leg and the end was sharpened.\n\n“People sure are weird, right?” Glenn looked to me for an answer.\n\n“Y-Yeah.” I responded. Years of desiring to come inside and it was weirder than my friends and I ever imagined. It was oddly enthralling to me at the time.\n\nMarshall walked into the kitchen and caught us staring at the table leg. “That’s a big splinter! Watch out, y’all!”\n\nIt was a terrible joke, but his stereotypical “surfer boy” accent got a chuckle out of Glenn and I. Marshall was certainly lazy, but he was also definitely funny. If he got you to laugh, the comedian in him wanted to keep the ball rolling with more and more jokes that built off the original one. He followed up with, “You know, when I was young, I once got a terrible splinter in my finger at school. It felt the size of that table leg. I was so scared to go to the nurse’s office because the last time I had a splinter, she had me pluck it out myself.”\n\n“Were you able to do it?” Glenn interrupted with an odd sense of interest.\n\n“Not a chance! I just cried until my mom showed up and did it for me. All of this is to say, I didn’t go to the nurse’s office to get this splinter out, right? Eventually, white puss starts to come out of it. While I’m at lunch one day, my buddy asks what was on my finger. I told him what any responsible kid would…that it was cream from an Oreo.”\n\n“No you did not!” I said through laughter.\n\n“I did! I did!” Marshall proclaimed. “That’s not even the craziest part. He asks me if he can have some, so I let him lick it off my finger.”\n\n“That’s disgusting! There’s no way your friend did that,” Glenn chuckled.\n\n“We were in the third grade. We did basically anything that our friends said. If you think that’s bad, wait until I tell you about the time we found a snake on the playgro-” Marshall was cut off by heavy thumping sounds coming down the stairs.\n\n“What was that?” Glenn stepped closer to me.\n\n“Jackson went to look at the second floor. He must be coming back down,” Marshall answered.\n\nAll three of us walked back into the foyer and found Jackson trying to pull his foot out of a hole in the bottom stair. He yelled out, “Upstairs *sucks*! Every room in this house is trashed and having no power is growing old already. I would have seen this stupid hole if we had lights instead of these bargain bin flashlights! Let’s record and get out of here!”\n\nJackson was heated, but he was right. The group came to record a segment for Mr. Yun, not to just explore. *I* was there to explore, but they didn’t know that. Glenn walked over to his box of camera equipment and began to distribute GoPros to everyone. Travis didn’t receive one, but you can’t pack a GoPro for someone you weren’t expecting to come. Glenn could tell Travis felt left out, so Glenn let him hold his while he explained the GoPros to the group.\n\n“The cameras are attached to a harness. You put on the harness, press the power button on the side, and they’ll start to record! Also attached to the harness is a flashlight stronger than the ones we had lying around in the van. Everyone got it?”\n\n“Where’s my normal camera? These are so small,” Eddie gave the camera a look of perplexion.\n\n“Is the camera small or are you just really big?” Jackson mumbled.\n\nGlenn ignored Jackson, “These are all we got. My dad was afraid we’d break the actual cameras if he wasn’t here to supervise us. We only have seven GoPros in total so don’t screw around with them.”\n\n“We had ten. What happened to the other three?” Marshall asked.\n\n“We’ve only ever had seven,” Glenn nervously insisted.\n\nI interrupted a potential argument with, “Marshall, I’ll take your side if you can tell me what today's date is.”\n\nMarshall paused and stared at the ceiling. He answered, “Touché.”\n\nGlenn flashed me a look of *Thank You* before we all set off to set up different decorations around the house. The idea was simple. Our anchors (Amanda and Jackson) would say they are here to investigate a house that was reportedly haunted. When we got back to the studio, a crazy backstory for the house would be invented for a voiceover that’d play over multiple stills of the house. Amanda and Jackson would ‘explore the house for the first time’ and encounter different spooky events set up with the decorations. Everyone else would be in different rooms to capture various angles.\n\nWe shot footage for about an hour. Honestly, it came out better than everyone expected. The GoPros made it look similar to a found footage horror film. A low budget one, but one nonetheless. The darkness of the house covered a lot of imperfections with the Halloween decorations. Even rubber spiders with googly eyes came off as real. Amanda was not a fan of that. We discovered spiders were one of her biggest fears. Jackson used this for his own amusement when he chased her around with a fake one. He giggled at her shrieks of terror. Later in the night, Eddie swore he saw one of the rubber spiders move…Maybe it did.\n\nAfter shooting wrapped, everyone was exhausted. It was a little past 9 PM and the drive back would have us return at roughly 5 AM. The whole plan of us coming here was so rushed that no one considered what we’d do after recording. We couldn’t just drive back, all of us were too tired. I knew for a fact that there weren’t any hotels around for hours either. None of us knew what to do. That’s when an idea crept from the abyss of my mind. *What if we just slept here for the night?*\n\nThe idea was crazy and certainly would be a tough sell, but I wanted to explore the second floor more and see if the house had a basement. I did not take an awkward 8 hour drive to *not* get everything out of Hill House 7. There wasn’t an easy way to suggest the idea, so I blurted it out. Ripped the bandaid right off. “What if we slept here tonight?”\n\nTheir chattering was immediately halted to a silence. My words acted as an assassin of conversation. Those few seconds of quiet became ages. I felt compelled to explain, but I couldn’t let them know why I truly wanted to stay. They’d think of me as selfish, which I was, but I didn’t want them to know that. \n\n“I know it doesn’t sound like a great suggestion at first. What else are we going to do though? If any of us try to drive, we will most likely end up in an accident due to exhaustion. This place isn’t so bad. There’s still some mattresses upstairs we could use. The couch is an option if we flip it upright and find the cushions. It’s one night. We can make it work for one night.”\n\nThe group remained silent as they thought over my words. Glenn was the first one to speak up, “I can’t wreck the van or my dad will kill me. One night can’t be so bad…right?”\n\nReluctantly, everyone else began to agree. Eddie voiced a concern that was shared by Travis. They were both scared to sleep alone. All of us went up to the second floor, grabbed the mattresses, and brought them back downstairs. We set the mattresses next to each other in a square shape in the center of the foyer. I was the first to remove my GoPro harness and hand it back to Glenn. Glenn didn’t accept it.\n\n“Everyone can hold onto their GoPro for the night, so you have a flashlight in case you need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. Please just be careful with them,” Glenn explained.\n\nMost of us thanked Glenn before laying down to fall asleep.\n\nFrom here, this is where everything went downhill. Each one of us experienced something different. To make this as coherent as possible, I am going to explain what happened to each one of us individually based on what I witnessed in the GoPro footage. First, I will start with Eddie.\n\nHis footage starts out in darkness. A few seconds in, Eddie whispered, “What was that?” He proceeded to click the flashlight on and attach the GoPro harness back on. The camera turned to show that the kitchen door was closed. This stuck out because I am *certain* that we left every door open out of fear of something hiding from us.\n\nLight peaked out from underneath the kitchen door. Eddie tried shaking Marshall awake to no success. “What…What’s that smell?” Eddie asked himself. He stood up and crept toward the kitchen. His large hand surrounded the doorknob and slowly turned it. The door opened with a loud creaking sound.\n\nEddie stepped inside and found a wrapped up chocolate on the floor. There was a moment of hesitation before he bent over, picked it up, and inspected it. “I haven’t seen this brand since I was a kid. Mom used to buy these for me all the time.” The wrapper crinkled as he opened it. His chewing was reminiscent of a pig. Each smack of his lips made it sound like he was out of breath but was always followed by a sigh of delight. While licking his fingers, he turned to find a trail of the chocolates leading to the fridge.\n\nEddie looked around before following the trail and picking up each chocolate along the way. He stepped up to the fridge door and found that it was ajar. Not only was it open, it seemed that it was slowly turning open by itself. Eddie assisted the door in its mission to open.\n\nWe didn’t check inside the fridge when we investigated the house because we thought there was no use. Eddie was the first to see inside of it. The outside of the fridge was banged up. The inside looked brand new. On the middle shelf sat a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs. Steam was rising from the bowl like it was freshly made. Eddie reached inside and grabbed it.\n\nHe placed it on the kitchen counter and just stared at it for several minutes. The silence of the house was broken when he said aloud, “How is this possible? No one has made the meatballs look like this since…since…Mom.” The meatballs all had a circular indent carved inside of them. They reminded me of the Death Star.\n\nHis hand reached out and grabbed a meatball. Hesitantly, almost out of fear, Eddie raised the meatball to his mouth and began to chew it. A female voice whispered from behind him, “Good boy.”\n\nEddie fell to the floor and the footage went black for an hour. 11 minutes in, sounds of a chair scraping along the floor bursted through. 23 minutes later, pots and pans clanging began. 8 minutes later and a knife could be heard chopping. Roughly 18 minutes passed before Eddie awoke and sat up. He was still in the kitchen but now he was at the kitchen table. The kitchen table stood up straight. I wondered how the table was fixed.\n\nThe only light in the room was from the bulb that hung above the table. The rest of the kitchen was engulfed by darkness. Eddie began to pant like he was struggling to move. I sat and watched for 2 minutes of Eddie seeming to try and move but to no avail. The same female voice outside of the camera’s view screamed out, “IT’S FEEDING TIME!” The voice was deep and oddly…loving. Like it cared that it was ‘feeding time.’\n\nEddie’s shaking began to become quicker, more desperate. Suddenly, a pale, skinny arm slowly came into frame. The skin looked like paper mache with some of it scrunching up or peeling off. In its wrinkled hand, it held a rusty spoon containing a substance I don’t even know how to describe. It was red, yet green and brown. Liquid dripped off the spoon but the ‘food’ was solid.\n\nThe voice scolded, “What did I say about electronics at the table!? This just will not do.”\n\nThe hand sped out of frame. *Click!* The harness holding the camera and flashlight were detached from Eddie then carefully placed on the kitchen table in front of him. Now, I was able to see everything. Eddie was tied to a large highchair. Around his neck sat a bib that read *Momma’s Baby Boy*.\n\nThe spoon peaked through the curtain of black that surrounded Eddie. The same arm brought the mush back to Eddie’s mouth. Eddie moved his head away and whimpered out, “P-Please…Please let me go.”\n\nThe female voice seemed concerned, “Not hungry? You used to love this stuff.”\n\nEddie began to tear up. “I don’t know what’s going on or who you are. Please let me go home. I’m begging you.”\n\nThe voice continued to ignore his pleas, “I spent so long making this meal…and…and you *REFUSE* to eat it!?”\n\n“HELP! HEEEELP!”\n\n“Mommy did not starve herself to allow you to eat…for you to NOT EAT!”\n\nThe monster, whom I refer to as *Mother*, whipped her left hand onto Eddie’s jaw. Both of her arms were long and had the appearance of fragility, but they had a true strength to them. Her fingers latched onto the sides of Eddie’s jaw like a monkey wrench to a bolt. It squeezed on tight and pulled so hard that it elongated Eddie’s face. All that Eddie could do was cry and give screams of agony as his face was morphed and stretched into something unrecognizable. \n\nMother’s fingers were rotting. A flap of skin fell into Eddie’s mouth and sat just below his tongue. He whimpered as it disintegrated in his mouth due to the buildup of saliva that had formed. The pool of saliva rose and rose before it began to steadily leak out of the corners of his mouth.\n\nMother hovered the spoon inside of Eddie’s mouth. She flipped the spoon and plopped the ‘food’ onto his tongue. Using her grip on his jaw, she moved her hand up and down to force Eddie to chew. Eddie gave a painful expression as he swallowed. His face looked as if he swallowed broken glass and rusted nails. “It’s good, right?” Mother asked with, from what I could tell, sincerity.\n\nShe released his jaw and revealed her face. Her neck elongated and slithered like a snake as her head came out of the darkness. The head was *enormous*. The best description I could give to its size is for you to imagine the height and width of a ferris wheel but from the perspective of an ant. The skin covering her face drooped like melting wax. Any move of her neck caused a wave of skin to ripple across the rest of her face. Her hair was sparse and what little remained constantly fell out like a shedding dog. Her eye sockets were craters with bulging veins that never stopped moving. The blood flowed through her veins with the movement pattern of a slug. Odd thing was, her actual eyes were tiny. The eyes looked like small buttons placed inside of a bowl. That didn’t make her glare any less intense though. I could feel it through the screen, so I cannot imagine what Eddie was feeling in person. Her lips cracked with the appearance of broken ceramic every time she spoke, but her teeth looked perfect.\n\nThe neck twisted and turned until it got Mother’s head beside Eddie’s ear. She whispered, “You seem so stressed. Normally when you’re stressed, you eat.” Her voice began to rise, “You damn near eat us out of house and home!” Mother chuckled to herself.\n\nShe wrapped her neck around the front of Eddie to speak in his other ear, “I don’t get it. I just don’t get it. I starve myself, so you can eat more. And yet…after I spend an hour of MY TIME to make YOU a home cooked meal…you refuse. You act like you don’t like it when I’ve watched you eat pizza with syrup on it. You’ll eat *anything*! So why not my cooking? Is…Is it me?”\n\nLarge tears began to stream from Mother’s face. She turned away from Eddie. His jaw hung like a damp towel in the wind as he attempted to say, “N-No. It’s not…not you!”\n\nMother went silent. The last of her tears *BOOMED* on the floor. “You’re right…It’s not me. It’s *YOU*! You’re ungrateful! Ungrateful of my time and effort! I’ve been working 10 hour shifts since your father abandoned us and do I get any sort of gratitude? NO!”\n\nEddie began to speak with true remorse, “Mom…I’m sorry. I didn’t know. If I had known, I would hav-”\n\n“NO MORE EXCUSES, YOUNG MAN! You will eat this food and *you will like it*!”\n\nMother unwrapped her neck around Eddie. Her face covered the entire backdrop of the screen as her left arm locked back in on Eddie’s jaw. Her right arm began to rapidly go in and out of frame as it filled the spoon, put it in his mouth, fed him, and repeated. Eddie desperately tried to swallow each spoonful before the next one came, but Mother only came back quicker over time. Each return of the spoon became more forceful than the last.\n\nEddie began to choke on the ‘food’ but that did not stop Mother from feeding him more. His eyes bulged out of his sockets as blood mixed with tears flowed down his cheeks. A drop of blood landed on the bib and took the shape of a heart. The spoonfuls started to be slammed into the back of his throat. The sounds that croaked out of Eddie were the most awful sounds I have had the displeasure of hearing. Imagine a duck slowly being choked out. Imagine it pleading for its life as someone’s hands became tighter around its neck. \n\nEddie’s face turned a darker shade of purple with each slam. Blood began to fling out with each exit of the spoon from his throat. Eddie’s body went limp by the time his face was a red-purple color and his jaw was three times its normal size. Mother continued to force feed him again, *and again*, ***and again*** for another 15 minutes until his mouth could not physically hold any more.\n\nMother deeply breathed in and out with exhaustion. She released Eddie’s jaw like a toy she was done playing with. His face immediately slammed into the kitchen table. Mother looked at her work and caringly said, “I hope you’re finally full. Enjoy your nap, my sweet baby boy.”\n\nThat was the last thing on the recording before it abruptly cut off. I hope you all see now why I wanted this story out. Eddie didn’t deserve his fate and neither did the others who didn’t make it. I’m happy to say that some of us did make it out but all of us should have. I’ll write about what happened to the others sometime soon. It’s hard for me to go back and watch these knowing that every second was my doing. All over some obsession I had in college. If you don’t continue to read what happened to the others, I understand. However, I truly believe each of their stories deserves to be out there.",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am documenting what happened because I wanted this story to come out years ago and it was never released. I understand why. After everything I and others endured though, I need it to be out. The reason any of it even happened in the first place is my fault. I was the cause for all of us to be in that house. I write this to warn others to not make the same stupid mistake I made. This is not a dare for someone to find the house. I will not even say the state the house is in. If by some miracle you somehow do find it, &lt;em&gt;stay away&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me explain. My name is James. Back in college, I was a commuter student. It was an hour drive up to the campus and an hour drive back home. I couldn’t afford on-campus housing and was very fortunate that my parents would let me stay with them. As much as spending hundreds of dollars a month on gas and missing out on making friends sucked, home cooked meals and a private bathroom made up for it more than enough. To get to campus, I had to drive over a bridge. About halfway through my junior year, there was an accident on that bridge. My GPS re-routed me to a path I had never taken before. Instead of my normal hour drive, it was upped to 3 hours. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;About 30 minutes into the drive, I noticed that I hadn’t passed &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; for at least 15 minutes. No gas stations, no fast food restaurants, nothing. It was just a straight road and grass. At first, I thought I must have just zoned out while driving. That had happened to me a lot since I drove so much. On subsequent drives on the same route while paying attention, sure enough, I would never see anything. Not even another car. Around 2 hours in is when you would be taken back into civilization.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However, there was always one thing that I would pass. The house. It was hard not to notice. Not because it’s the only structure for miles but because of how it looked. It stood out like a sore thumb. For miles, all that could be seen was flat land. The house stood on a hill. The scenery leading up to it was lush greenery; as if Mother Nature herself had been looking after it. The house was grey and falling apart. On the right side of the house, there was a massive hole that bled into the roof. A hole so big that I could only imagine something the size of a meteor could have caused it. The house didn’t even have a driveway. It was like the ground surrounding the house had swallowed the driveway to let people know they were not welcome inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I asked my few friends on campus if they had ever seen or heard of the house. They had no clue what I was talking about, but they were intrigued. That weekend, I took them to visit it. Something that I noticed on that trip was the mailbox. I must have been driving past the house too fast to see it every other time. It was slanted and rusty. The only number left on the side was 7. We were all too scared to get too close to the house and made lame excuses like “It’s just too far of a walk and yesterday was leg day.” From there on out though, my friends and I took to calling it “Hill House 7”. We’d share horror stories on what happened inside. Some of my favorites were:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A husband murdered his wife and ran off with the insurance money. The house still stands because her soul still dwells within its walls.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Aliens crashed into the house and reside inside. They have learned to integrate themselves into society and live in the busted old house to avoid paying taxes.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;A serial killer tortures their victims in the basement. It’s the perfect place for a murderer. The house is far enough away from society so the screams won’t be heard, but close enough to society to work within it, make a living, and look for new subjects.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If I didn’t have to take the route that passed Hill House 7, I wouldn’t. It always gave me chills to look at or even think about. I never witnessed anything abnormal inside the house, but word spread around campus about the house. My friends were very extroverted people, so I assumed they were the ones to tell others. Stories much worse than the ones we came up with were told. Apparently one girl visited the house on a dare and was never seen again. I never fully believed anything I heard, but I was always curious. I told myself that one day, I would be man enough to enter the house. Years later, I did. I just wish I hadn’t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After college, I got a job at a small, local news station. I had a Computer Science degree, so I felt upset with the position I was at in life. I felt that I deserved more. My mindset was that I should be working with dozens of geniuses every day. Instead, I was working in an apartment sized office with barely any employees. We definitely didn’t have the budget to bring on any other staff and the size of the building couldn’t handle any more people either. Sometimes it felt like we were canned sardines. If someone called in sick, we’d celebrate having some extra space instead of feeling sorry for them. The staff consisted of the owner (Mr. Yun), Glenn, Mark, Eddie, Jackson, Amanda, Marshall, and myself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few years into this job, I remember walking into Mr. Yun’s office to inform him that the toilets weren’t flushing again. He was at his desk with his face in his hands. When he heard his door creak open, his head was pulled up with a struggle as if there were a weight tied to his neck. His face had a look of distraught sewn onto it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Everything alright, sir?” I asked. He became stressed very easily. Honestly, sometimes it annoyed my younger self because it happened so often.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Yun gave a deep sigh then said, “Not exactly. The Halloween story I had planned to be shown is &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more expensive than I thought. Halloween is in 2 days and we have nothing ready to go as a backup! I have no idea what to do.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Can we just take off on Halloween?” I responded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And upset the few advertisers we have left? No chance,” Mr. Yun placed his head back in his hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, I remembered the house. The thought of it rushed to my head like an Olympic runner to a finish line. I pondered on whether I should mention it or not. My rationale to suggest it was that this could be my chance to finally enter it. Being paid to step inside was an added bonus. “I may have an idea,” I stated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“And that is?” Mr. Yun mumbled through his hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Hill House 7.” Saying its name aloud after all those years sent a shiver down my spine. “Back in college, I found an old, desecrated house. It looked like a professional haunted house or something you’d see out of a horror movie. Rumors of ghosts and spirits residing within the house circulated my campus. Maybe we could do a story on that?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You want me to give TV time to an old house?” Mr. Yun scoffed. “My wife is old. You want to give her TV time too?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t mean that we find out how the house got into the state it&amp;#39;s in. I meant that we record the inside of the house. There’s gotta be something spooky inside that we could spin into an interesting story.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Yun sat in silence for a moment before looking up at me. “Do you have a photo of this house? I’m not going to pay the crew to drive to a normal looking suburban home.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled out my phone and began to scroll back. My phone’s storage had been begging me to put it down, but I was too sentimental to delete anything or download my pictures somewhere. What if I needed them someday? That day proved to me that I was right. After scrolling back a few years, I finally found a photo. I hadn’t seen the house for so long. Just seeing a picture of it shot me from a 26-year-old back into the shoes of my 19-year-old self.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mr. Yun’s eyes glued to the photo. He didn’t move for a good 45 seconds. For a moment, I thought his constant stress had finally put him in a coma and that I’d have to pull my phone from the hands of a corpse. His head snapped up as he handed my phone back. When Mr. Yun wasn’t stressed, he spoke very matter-of-factly. The picture must have brought him some ease because he returned to his normal speaking pattern, “Take the van. Tell the rest of the crew that you all leave tomorrow. Buy some items from a Halloween store to fake some scares. If nothing happens while you’re there, you &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; something happen. Spend the night if you have too. Am I clear?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes, sir,” I responded. Honestly, I didn’t care what it took as long as I got the greenlight to visit the house on a paid trip. Faking some scares? Sounded easy enough to me. Definitely not my most difficult day on the job. In those days, I believed everything at the station wasn’t hard though. My impression of the station was that it was inefficient and would have been run better by me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I left Mr. Yun’s office and gathered the crew. I explained to them that we’d be taking a field trip the next day. The house was 8 hours away from the station and we wanted to arrive when it was getting dark to maximize the creepiness factor. The plan was to leave at 12 PM the following day. When I got home from work, I was a bit ecstatic. So many years after seeing Hill House 7 for the first time and staring at it from afar, I would finally enter it. To think, my friends and I used to create stories about what happened inside. Seven years later, and I was going to do it again but &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Waking up the next day, I shot out of bed, got dressed, and ran to a Halloween store nearby to purchase some Halloween decorations. It was pretty baron, but that was to be expected on the day before Halloween. I grabbed some fake spiderwebs, rubber spiders, plastic skeletons, an orb that you’d see a psychic use at a fair, and almost anything else that was left on the shelves. Nothing was too realistic, but with the right lighting, we could make a story out of it all. I threw it all into my car’s trunk and made my way to the station.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I arrived, I saw Glenn packing the news van. Glenn was Mr. Yun’s son. He knew that the station wasn’t as profitable as it once was, so he always took very good care of the camera equipment. We couldn’t afford to buy any new equipment. The rust covering half the news logo on the van and a different colored door showed that to everyone on the road as it was driven around.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Glenn was barely 20-years-old and extremely kind. I always felt that innocent vibes emanated from him like an aroma from a flower. His sweetness was teased by Jackson. Jackson Todd was basically a high school bully that never grew up after graduation. I was reminded of this when I saw him trip Glenn as Glenn carried a box to the van.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amanda was in the passenger seat looking at herself in the mirror. She witnessed the trip and said nothing as she put eyeliner on. Sometimes I swore she didn’t live in the same world as the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jackson helped Glenn to his feet and condescendingly said, “You gotta look where you’re walking, bud. This ground is uneven. It rises and falls all over the place! Be careful from now on, okay?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Y-Yeah. I will. Thanks,” Glenn spoke quietly as he checked the equipment inside the box.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jackson was a Grade A douche and Amanda…Amanda just had a lot of personal issues. She’d carry a pocket mirror on her at all times and check her face at least once every 2 minutes. After her 30th birthday, she got &lt;em&gt;veeeeery&lt;/em&gt; self conscious about her looks. Deep down I think she felt like with each passing year, she was worth less and less. She’d go on rants about how soon the station would replace her with someone younger. “The next young, hot thing” would take her job as news anchor, she would say. When other news stations were on in the office, she’d analyze every female anchor. She’d comment on how great their noses were, how plump their lips were, their freckles, and any other minute detail she found. Complaints about herself spewed from her mouth like a waterfall day after day. Her face was constantly covered in pounds of makeup. Every year after turning 30, more makeup would be added. At the time we were going to visit the house, she was 34-years-old. It’s a shame what she thought of herself. She was beautiful and a kind soul before her mind began to deceive her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I parked my car next to Mark. Like everything else at the station, his car was cheap and poorly looked after. He didn’t care much for the upkeep of anything after his wife passed away. I saw him yelling at his son in the backseat. “What is his son doing here?” I wondered. What I did know was that I was not stepping in to ask him while he was shouting, so I grabbed the bag of Halloween decorations from my car and walked over to the van. Like normal, Eddie had arrived in a stained t-shirt that didn’t fit him. Half his belly button and the bottom of his hairy stomach poked out of the extra large shirt. Eddie didn’t have a tragic reason not to take care of himself like Mark. He was just disgusting. Some type of snack could always be found in his hand or nearby. That day it was a bag of Cheetos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Glenn rushed over to help me with the bags I was carrying. Seven bags were strapped around my arms, shoulders, and neck. Back in the day, I was stubborn and too confident. Two trips to bring the groceries inside? I didn’t think so! I’d do everything in my power to make it only one. $18 for a cheeseburger at a restaurant for my girlfriend’s birthday? Too expensive! I told her I would make one at home and had full confidence that my cooking would surpass the chefs with actual schooling and experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jackson smoked a cigarette and watched as Glenn and I packed everything into the van. By the time we were done, Mark was walking over to us with his son. I heard Jackson exclaim, “What’s up with the kid?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to find a babysitter on such short notice! Maybe if we had known about this trip &lt;em&gt;a week ago&lt;/em&gt; then I could have found someone to watch him!” Mark responded. He sounded more annoyed than usual.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“He’s so small. How old is he? Like…4-years-old?” Jackson questioned as if he had never seen a child before.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Travis is 8-years-old and he’s not going to be a bother. Right?” Mark stared down at Travis with intensity and spoke through gritted teeth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While staring at the ground, Travis whispered, “I won’t be.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mark looked back up to the group and said,  “Just think of today as a ‘Bring Your Kid to Work’ day. Okay? Okay. Let’s head out.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We couldn’t yet though. Marshall still hadn’t arrived. That was to be expected. He never arrived anywhere on time. If you wanted him somewhere at 6:30 PM, you’d have to tell him 6 PM. One day he was two hours late to work. Obviously, Mr. Yun was not very pleased. What could he do though? If he fired Marshall, he’d have to find someone else willing to work for as low of a pay as Marshall had. I heard that the minimum wage was shifted up a few dollars and Marshall’s paycheck didn’t budge. There was not a care in the world for Marshall. No rush or incentive to do…anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We sat around waiting for him for a little over 45 minutes. He pulled in and parked in a handicap spot. Opening his car door released a cloud of smoke. The smoke fled from his car and rose into the air as he stepped out coughing. The stench protruding from Marshall was awful. I could practically see stench lines coming off of him like he was a cartoon character.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What’s up, y’all?” Marshall asked while lifting up his sagging jeans.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Not your pants, I’ll tell you that!” Eddie put his orange stained hand up expecting a high five. Upon realizing that no one was going to take him up on that offer, he lowered his hand back into his bag of Cheetos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With everyone being present, we could finally head out. It was a long, awkward drive. If you think working in a confined space with people you don’t know is weird, try an 8 hour car ride. Glenn drove since it was father’s van, Amanda stayed in her position of “Passenger Princess”, and I was stuck with everyone else in the back. There were a lot of long moments of silence. Occasionally, a conversation would strike up but would die out fast. This intensified the quiet. The dead space felt constricting at times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few times, Glenn would run over a pothole and mess up Amanda’s makeup process. She was not pleased and slowly became vocal about it. This would prompt Jackson to make remarks like, “If you don’t like your seat up there, I have a spot for you to sit on back here.” You couldn’t tell him to stop or you’d only egg him on. Then he’d say increasingly worse things. At one point, I told him to watch what he was saying since a kid was around. Jackson proceeded to say every swear word in existence for the next 5 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The drive was terrible, but nothing could stop my excitement of returning to Hill House 7. When we finally did arrive, it was exactly as I remembered it from all those years ago. The pit I had in my stomach returned like it was the first time I had ever seen the house. The difference was, this time I had a newfound burst of energy and I was going to enter inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“There’s…There’s no driveway. What way do I drive?” Glenn asked as he pulled the car onto the side of the road.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Just park it here. That’s what my friends and I used to do,” I responded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Won’t I get a ticket? I can’t come back to my dad with a ticket on the company van!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jackson chimed in, “You won’t get a ticket. You’re going to go to jail. Don’t worry, Amanda. I’ll drive you home.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Plenty of cars do it! You’ll be fine,” I quickly retorted. I really had seen many cars parked on the side of the road as I commuted to and from campus.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A mix of feeling questioned, my eagerness to look inside, and the desire to get out of the back of the van all led to me coming off annoyed. Honestly, I was. The car ride and Jackson’s comments certainly didn’t help with that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Glenn put the car into park and took the key out of the ignition. I burst through the backdoors of the van. Air had never felt so crisp and refreshing before. Outside it was dark, but the house illuminated itself to me like a beacon. How a lighthouse makes itself known to unsuspecting ships. There was no physical light coming from the house, so maybe it was actually trying to repel me away from danger. The same as the true purpose of lighthouses is to keep ships from crashing into it and nearby hazards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were seven bags and eight of us. Mark wanted Travis to grab a bag so he’d “carry his weight on this trip.” The bag was half the kid’s height and he struggled to even lift it. Glenn silently walked over to Travis, knelt down, smiled, and took the bag from him with his open hand. Everyone walked towards the house while Mark and Travis stayed in the back of the group. Mark was whispering, but I could make out phrases like “Don’t embarrass me like that again.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The walk to the house felt longer than it used to be. Originally, I believed it must have been something to do with age. Maybe my stamina had just decreased? It &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; an uphill walk. Looking back…I’m not so sure that was the case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arriving at the porch, we found that the door was already open. Amanda, Eddie, and Travis were ready to turn back around right then and there. I was too involved with this to leave, Jackson had a tough guy persona he had to uphold, and Mark and Marshall didn’t really care either way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Amanda was the first to speak, “This place is stressing me out. Stress creates wrinkles and I have an image to maintain! Let’s leave.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Sweetheart, I’ll protect you from the monsters that lurk around all corners inside. Don’t worry!” Jackson exclaimed as he wrapped his arm around Amanda. She swiftly swatted it off like it was a mosquito.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You really want to miss the opportunity to be on camera for a potentially popular story?” I asked. It was manipulative of me to use something she was self conscious about against her. Back then, I didn’t really care. I needed them all to stay and didn’t care what they thought about it all. I’m sorry to everyone. I am.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Out of my way!” Amanda shoved everyone aside and walked in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We all followed. The foyer was essentially empty. It had stairs, with boards which were most likely unsafe to walk on, that led to the second floor. The center of the room had a damp carpet littered with rips, holes, and weird stains. From the foyer, the house branched off into three rooms. Walking straight from the front door and past the stairs would take you to a full bath. A few of the corners of the bathroom had mold but the wallpaper was a nice shade of yellow. Rust surrounded the faucets of the sink and bathtub. As a joke, I turned the knobs to the sink. A loud rumbling sound emanated from the pipes below the sink before a rush of water flowed from the faucet. We were all genuinely surprised. Not only did the sink have running water but the bathtub did as well. The toilet refused to flush then proceeded to gift us with the sight of watching a rat crawl up through the hole of the toilet bowl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The room on the right of the foyer took you into the living room. This is the room where the meteor sized hole resided. Large puddles of water glistened in the moonlight near where I presumed a window used to be. The couch was flipped onto its back. The cushions were torn up and the bottom of the couch had a spray painted word scrawled onto it. The writing was sloppy, but I was able to make out the word &lt;em&gt;CHANGE&lt;/em&gt;. I had no clue what this meant at the time and could only think about how much this house had changed from its original inception. Multiple families must have lived here over the years and called it home. A once loved home which now looked like it was begging to be put out of its misery after decades of neglect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Taking a left at the foyer led you into the kitchen. Cabinet doors covered parts of the floor. A few were covered in scratches. I remember thinking that this place must have been a hotspot for stray cats and homeless people. Above the oven, the wall was charred. Like someone had chosen to set fire and scorch only one part of the house. The kitchen table stood at a slant near the window. One of its legs was off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Who would take off a single table leg?” Glenn asked me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know. I know where they put it though.” I motioned over to the kitchen sink. The table leg was poking out of the wall. Upon a closer look, someone had scratched &lt;em&gt;Lustful&lt;/em&gt; into the leg and the end was sharpened.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“People sure are weird, right?” Glenn looked to me for an answer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Y-Yeah.” I responded. Years of desiring to come inside and it was weirder than my friends and I ever imagined. It was oddly enthralling to me at the time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marshall walked into the kitchen and caught us staring at the table leg. “That’s a big splinter! Watch out, y’all!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a terrible joke, but his stereotypical “surfer boy” accent got a chuckle out of Glenn and I. Marshall was certainly lazy, but he was also definitely funny. If he got you to laugh, the comedian in him wanted to keep the ball rolling with more and more jokes that built off the original one. He followed up with, “You know, when I was young, I once got a terrible splinter in my finger at school. It felt the size of that table leg. I was so scared to go to the nurse’s office because the last time I had a splinter, she had me pluck it out myself.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Were you able to do it?” Glenn interrupted with an odd sense of interest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Not a chance! I just cried until my mom showed up and did it for me. All of this is to say, I didn’t go to the nurse’s office to get this splinter out, right? Eventually, white puss starts to come out of it. While I’m at lunch one day, my buddy asks what was on my finger. I told him what any responsible kid would…that it was cream from an Oreo.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No you did not!” I said through laughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I did! I did!” Marshall proclaimed. “That’s not even the craziest part. He asks me if he can have some, so I let him lick it off my finger.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s disgusting! There’s no way your friend did that,” Glenn chuckled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We were in the third grade. We did basically anything that our friends said. If you think that’s bad, wait until I tell you about the time we found a snake on the playgro-” Marshall was cut off by heavy thumping sounds coming down the stairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What was that?” Glenn stepped closer to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Jackson went to look at the second floor. He must be coming back down,” Marshall answered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All three of us walked back into the foyer and found Jackson trying to pull his foot out of a hole in the bottom stair. He yelled out, “Upstairs &lt;em&gt;sucks&lt;/em&gt;! Every room in this house is trashed and having no power is growing old already. I would have seen this stupid hole if we had lights instead of these bargain bin flashlights! Let’s record and get out of here!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jackson was heated, but he was right. The group came to record a segment for Mr. Yun, not to just explore. &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; was there to explore, but they didn’t know that. Glenn walked over to his box of camera equipment and began to distribute GoPros to everyone. Travis didn’t receive one, but you can’t pack a GoPro for someone you weren’t expecting to come. Glenn could tell Travis felt left out, so Glenn let him hold his while he explained the GoPros to the group.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The cameras are attached to a harness. You put on the harness, press the power button on the side, and they’ll start to record! Also attached to the harness is a flashlight stronger than the ones we had lying around in the van. Everyone got it?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Where’s my normal camera? These are so small,” Eddie gave the camera a look of perplexion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Is the camera small or are you just really big?” Jackson mumbled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Glenn ignored Jackson, “These are all we got. My dad was afraid we’d break the actual cameras if he wasn’t here to supervise us. We only have seven GoPros in total so don’t screw around with them.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We had ten. What happened to the other three?” Marshall asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’ve only ever had seven,” Glenn nervously insisted.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I interrupted a potential argument with, “Marshall, I’ll take your side if you can tell me what today&amp;#39;s date is.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Marshall paused and stared at the ceiling. He answered, “Touché.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Glenn flashed me a look of &lt;em&gt;Thank You&lt;/em&gt; before we all set off to set up different decorations around the house. The idea was simple. Our anchors (Amanda and Jackson) would say they are here to investigate a house that was reportedly haunted. When we got back to the studio, a crazy backstory for the house would be invented for a voiceover that’d play over multiple stills of the house. Amanda and Jackson would ‘explore the house for the first time’ and encounter different spooky events set up with the decorations. Everyone else would be in different rooms to capture various angles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We shot footage for about an hour. Honestly, it came out better than everyone expected. The GoPros made it look similar to a found footage horror film. A low budget one, but one nonetheless. The darkness of the house covered a lot of imperfections with the Halloween decorations. Even rubber spiders with googly eyes came off as real. Amanda was not a fan of that. We discovered spiders were one of her biggest fears. Jackson used this for his own amusement when he chased her around with a fake one. He giggled at her shrieks of terror. Later in the night, Eddie swore he saw one of the rubber spiders move…Maybe it did.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After shooting wrapped, everyone was exhausted. It was a little past 9 PM and the drive back would have us return at roughly 5 AM. The whole plan of us coming here was so rushed that no one considered what we’d do after recording. We couldn’t just drive back, all of us were too tired. I knew for a fact that there weren’t any hotels around for hours either. None of us knew what to do. That’s when an idea crept from the abyss of my mind. &lt;em&gt;What if we just slept here for the night?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The idea was crazy and certainly would be a tough sell, but I wanted to explore the second floor more and see if the house had a basement. I did not take an awkward 8 hour drive to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; get everything out of Hill House 7. There wasn’t an easy way to suggest the idea, so I blurted it out. Ripped the bandaid right off. “What if we slept here tonight?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their chattering was immediately halted to a silence. My words acted as an assassin of conversation. Those few seconds of quiet became ages. I felt compelled to explain, but I couldn’t let them know why I truly wanted to stay. They’d think of me as selfish, which I was, but I didn’t want them to know that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I know it doesn’t sound like a great suggestion at first. What else are we going to do though? If any of us try to drive, we will most likely end up in an accident due to exhaustion. This place isn’t so bad. There’s still some mattresses upstairs we could use. The couch is an option if we flip it upright and find the cushions. It’s one night. We can make it work for one night.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The group remained silent as they thought over my words. Glenn was the first one to speak up, “I can’t wreck the van or my dad will kill me. One night can’t be so bad…right?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reluctantly, everyone else began to agree. Eddie voiced a concern that was shared by Travis. They were both scared to sleep alone. All of us went up to the second floor, grabbed the mattresses, and brought them back downstairs. We set the mattresses next to each other in a square shape in the center of the foyer. I was the first to remove my GoPro harness and hand it back to Glenn. Glenn didn’t accept it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Everyone can hold onto their GoPro for the night, so you have a flashlight in case you need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night. Please just be careful with them,” Glenn explained.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most of us thanked Glenn before laying down to fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From here, this is where everything went downhill. Each one of us experienced something different. To make this as coherent as possible, I am going to explain what happened to each one of us individually based on what I witnessed in the GoPro footage. First, I will start with Eddie.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His footage starts out in darkness. A few seconds in, Eddie whispered, “What was that?” He proceeded to click the flashlight on and attach the GoPro harness back on. The camera turned to show that the kitchen door was closed. This stuck out because I am &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; that we left every door open out of fear of something hiding from us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Light peaked out from underneath the kitchen door. Eddie tried shaking Marshall awake to no success. “What…What’s that smell?” Eddie asked himself. He stood up and crept toward the kitchen. His large hand surrounded the doorknob and slowly turned it. The door opened with a loud creaking sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eddie stepped inside and found a wrapped up chocolate on the floor. There was a moment of hesitation before he bent over, picked it up, and inspected it. “I haven’t seen this brand since I was a kid. Mom used to buy these for me all the time.” The wrapper crinkled as he opened it. His chewing was reminiscent of a pig. Each smack of his lips made it sound like he was out of breath but was always followed by a sigh of delight. While licking his fingers, he turned to find a trail of the chocolates leading to the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eddie looked around before following the trail and picking up each chocolate along the way. He stepped up to the fridge door and found that it was ajar. Not only was it open, it seemed that it was slowly turning open by itself. Eddie assisted the door in its mission to open.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We didn’t check inside the fridge when we investigated the house because we thought there was no use. Eddie was the first to see inside of it. The outside of the fridge was banged up. The inside looked brand new. On the middle shelf sat a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs. Steam was rising from the bowl like it was freshly made. Eddie reached inside and grabbed it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He placed it on the kitchen counter and just stared at it for several minutes. The silence of the house was broken when he said aloud, “How is this possible? No one has made the meatballs look like this since…since…Mom.” The meatballs all had a circular indent carved inside of them. They reminded me of the Death Star.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His hand reached out and grabbed a meatball. Hesitantly, almost out of fear, Eddie raised the meatball to his mouth and began to chew it. A female voice whispered from behind him, “Good boy.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eddie fell to the floor and the footage went black for an hour. 11 minutes in, sounds of a chair scraping along the floor bursted through. 23 minutes later, pots and pans clanging began. 8 minutes later and a knife could be heard chopping. Roughly 18 minutes passed before Eddie awoke and sat up. He was still in the kitchen but now he was at the kitchen table. The kitchen table stood up straight. I wondered how the table was fixed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only light in the room was from the bulb that hung above the table. The rest of the kitchen was engulfed by darkness. Eddie began to pant like he was struggling to move. I sat and watched for 2 minutes of Eddie seeming to try and move but to no avail. The same female voice outside of the camera’s view screamed out, “IT’S FEEDING TIME!” The voice was deep and oddly…loving. Like it cared that it was ‘feeding time.’&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eddie’s shaking began to become quicker, more desperate. Suddenly, a pale, skinny arm slowly came into frame. The skin looked like paper mache with some of it scrunching up or peeling off. In its wrinkled hand, it held a rusty spoon containing a substance I don’t even know how to describe. It was red, yet green and brown. Liquid dripped off the spoon but the ‘food’ was solid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The voice scolded, “What did I say about electronics at the table!? This just will not do.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The hand sped out of frame. &lt;em&gt;Click!&lt;/em&gt; The harness holding the camera and flashlight were detached from Eddie then carefully placed on the kitchen table in front of him. Now, I was able to see everything. Eddie was tied to a large highchair. Around his neck sat a bib that read &lt;em&gt;Momma’s Baby Boy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The spoon peaked through the curtain of black that surrounded Eddie. The same arm brought the mush back to Eddie’s mouth. Eddie moved his head away and whimpered out, “P-Please…Please let me go.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The female voice seemed concerned, “Not hungry? You used to love this stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eddie began to tear up. “I don’t know what’s going on or who you are. Please let me go home. I’m begging you.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The voice continued to ignore his pleas, “I spent so long making this meal…and…and you &lt;em&gt;REFUSE&lt;/em&gt; to eat it!?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“HELP! HEEEELP!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Mommy did not starve herself to allow you to eat…for you to NOT EAT!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The monster, whom I refer to as &lt;em&gt;Mother&lt;/em&gt;, whipped her left hand onto Eddie’s jaw. Both of her arms were long and had the appearance of fragility, but they had a true strength to them. Her fingers latched onto the sides of Eddie’s jaw like a monkey wrench to a bolt. It squeezed on tight and pulled so hard that it elongated Eddie’s face. All that Eddie could do was cry and give screams of agony as his face was morphed and stretched into something unrecognizable. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mother’s fingers were rotting. A flap of skin fell into Eddie’s mouth and sat just below his tongue. He whimpered as it disintegrated in his mouth due to the buildup of saliva that had formed. The pool of saliva rose and rose before it began to steadily leak out of the corners of his mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mother hovered the spoon inside of Eddie’s mouth. She flipped the spoon and plopped the ‘food’ onto his tongue. Using her grip on his jaw, she moved her hand up and down to force Eddie to chew. Eddie gave a painful expression as he swallowed. His face looked as if he swallowed broken glass and rusted nails. “It’s good, right?” Mother asked with, from what I could tell, sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She released his jaw and revealed her face. Her neck elongated and slithered like a snake as her head came out of the darkness. The head was &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt;. The best description I could give to its size is for you to imagine the height and width of a ferris wheel but from the perspective of an ant. The skin covering her face drooped like melting wax. Any move of her neck caused a wave of skin to ripple across the rest of her face. Her hair was sparse and what little remained constantly fell out like a shedding dog. Her eye sockets were craters with bulging veins that never stopped moving. The blood flowed through her veins with the movement pattern of a slug. Odd thing was, her actual eyes were tiny. The eyes looked like small buttons placed inside of a bowl. That didn’t make her glare any less intense though. I could feel it through the screen, so I cannot imagine what Eddie was feeling in person. Her lips cracked with the appearance of broken ceramic every time she spoke, but her teeth looked perfect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The neck twisted and turned until it got Mother’s head beside Eddie’s ear. She whispered, “You seem so stressed. Normally when you’re stressed, you eat.” Her voice began to rise, “You damn near eat us out of house and home!” Mother chuckled to herself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She wrapped her neck around the front of Eddie to speak in his other ear, “I don’t get it. I just don’t get it. I starve myself, so you can eat more. And yet…after I spend an hour of MY TIME to make YOU a home cooked meal…you refuse. You act like you don’t like it when I’ve watched you eat pizza with syrup on it. You’ll eat &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;! So why not my cooking? Is…Is it me?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Large tears began to stream from Mother’s face. She turned away from Eddie. His jaw hung like a damp towel in the wind as he attempted to say, “N-No. It’s not…not you!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mother went silent. The last of her tears &lt;em&gt;BOOMED&lt;/em&gt; on the floor. “You’re right…It’s not me. It’s &lt;em&gt;YOU&lt;/em&gt;! You’re ungrateful! Ungrateful of my time and effort! I’ve been working 10 hour shifts since your father abandoned us and do I get any sort of gratitude? NO!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eddie began to speak with true remorse, “Mom…I’m sorry. I didn’t know. If I had known, I would hav-”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“NO MORE EXCUSES, YOUNG MAN! You will eat this food and &lt;em&gt;you will like it&lt;/em&gt;!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mother unwrapped her neck around Eddie. Her face covered the entire backdrop of the screen as her left arm locked back in on Eddie’s jaw. Her right arm began to rapidly go in and out of frame as it filled the spoon, put it in his mouth, fed him, and repeated. Eddie desperately tried to swallow each spoonful before the next one came, but Mother only came back quicker over time. Each return of the spoon became more forceful than the last.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eddie began to choke on the ‘food’ but that did not stop Mother from feeding him more. His eyes bulged out of his sockets as blood mixed with tears flowed down his cheeks. A drop of blood landed on the bib and took the shape of a heart. The spoonfuls started to be slammed into the back of his throat. The sounds that croaked out of Eddie were the most awful sounds I have had the displeasure of hearing. Imagine a duck slowly being choked out. Imagine it pleading for its life as someone’s hands became tighter around its neck. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eddie’s face turned a darker shade of purple with each slam. Blood began to fling out with each exit of the spoon from his throat. Eddie’s body went limp by the time his face was a red-purple color and his jaw was three times its normal size. Mother continued to force feed him again, &lt;em&gt;and again&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for another 15 minutes until his mouth could not physically hold any more.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mother deeply breathed in and out with exhaustion. She released Eddie’s jaw like a toy she was done playing with. His face immediately slammed into the kitchen table. Mother looked at her work and caringly said, “I hope you’re finally full. Enjoy your nap, my sweet baby boy.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That was the last thing on the recording before it abruptly cut off. I hope you all see now why I wanted this story out. Eddie didn’t deserve his fate and neither did the others who didn’t make it. I’m happy to say that some of us did make it out but all of us should have. I’ll write about what happened to the others sometime soon. It’s hard for me to go back and watch these knowing that every second was my doing. All over some obsession I had in college. If you don’t continue to read what happened to the others, I understand. However, I truly believe each of their stories deserves to be out there.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Hi ive like never made a post on reddit it scares the shit outta me but I havent been able to find much feedback for my specific situation so im gonna talk about it i guess. My mom frequents subreddits like this a lot to try and help me so uh if you see this mom hi lol. Long post warnin probably.\n\nI (23M) have been diagnosed autistic for uhh 2, 3 years now? Since im trans, many of my early behaviors werent picked up as autistic traits, since they were so different from my adhd brother's. My mom has been a huge help these past few years, we've improved our relationship a lot after we figured out im autistic, but theres only so much she can do in the face of incompetent doctors and unfair government aid. (we're trying to get me on disability, its a fuckin process thats for sure) Alongside my autism, I have been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. This isnt even getting into the physical health problems, which we're desperately trying to find answers for but its hard when I dont even know what to tell doctors. As it is now, I have a diagnosis for fibromiyalga (i cant remember how to spell it, sorry) and orthostatic hypotension, but my persistent fatigue, gut problems, brain fog, temperature sensitivity, and many other issues are still unsolved. All this, along with my sensory issues and social issues, make it almost impossible to look for a job. I was taking college classes briefly, but taking the bus and worrying about grades when I just wanted to enjoy the material of the classes was incredibly stressful. I am not tech savvy, I have never had a good grasp on computers, but I am an artist. Particularly, in the past couple years, I have become very fond of ceramics. (not the wheel though fuck the wheel. sensory nightmare). Though I am also an illustrator, painter, and have dabbled in many mediums. Along with all this, I was in a car accident when learning to drive around uhh fifteen i think? And now have a terrible fear of driving, so any commute would be impossible for me unless wherever i lived had good public transit (although even then it stresses me out almost to the point of a panic attack if the bus isnt EXACTLY on time. i need to be on time to things or i get very stressed). I want to eventually (within the next couple years or so ideally) move in with some friends who are also autistic and trans, likely in Los Angeles since thats where two of them live currently and i'm a train ride away from there right now. My current situation is that I live with my older brother(33M) and a roommate we never really see in an two bedroom apartment, my room is just the living room and I feel as though I have no privacy, my door is a curtain and the sloped ceiling means you can see right into my room from the stairs. We're finally discussing moving after nearly 6 years in this apartment, but im just so tired of it. In an ideal world, I would be able to sustain myself by selling my art, mainly my sculptures, but I cant exactly do that with no backup plan. If (hopefully when) I move in with friends, I want to look for a ceramics studio nearby and keep creating, but of course it costs money to join a studio. (im currently creating at my grandmas ceramics club at her old folks community)\n\nI guess my question is, does anyone know how to go about searching for remote jobs that someone who has inconsistent sleep patterns and feels dizzy most of the time could manage? I feel like my physical condition is only getting worse, and I dont want to be that person who freeloads off my friends, especially when they all have their own struggles. Sorry for rambling so much but I feel helpless, even all I said here feels like it doesnt encapsulate the whole situation, but oh well, i dont want to make people read my whole life story. ",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi ive like never made a post on reddit it scares the shit outta me but I havent been able to find much feedback for my specific situation so im gonna talk about it i guess. My mom frequents subreddits like this a lot to try and help me so uh if you see this mom hi lol. Long post warnin probably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I (23M) have been diagnosed autistic for uhh 2, 3 years now? Since im trans, many of my early behaviors werent picked up as autistic traits, since they were so different from my adhd brother&amp;#39;s. My mom has been a huge help these past few years, we&amp;#39;ve improved our relationship a lot after we figured out im autistic, but theres only so much she can do in the face of incompetent doctors and unfair government aid. (we&amp;#39;re trying to get me on disability, its a fuckin process thats for sure) Alongside my autism, I have been diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety. This isnt even getting into the physical health problems, which we&amp;#39;re desperately trying to find answers for but its hard when I dont even know what to tell doctors. As it is now, I have a diagnosis for fibromiyalga (i cant remember how to spell it, sorry) and orthostatic hypotension, but my persistent fatigue, gut problems, brain fog, temperature sensitivity, and many other issues are still unsolved. All this, along with my sensory issues and social issues, make it almost impossible to look for a job. I was taking college classes briefly, but taking the bus and worrying about grades when I just wanted to enjoy the material of the classes was incredibly stressful. I am not tech savvy, I have never had a good grasp on computers, but I am an artist. Particularly, in the past couple years, I have become very fond of ceramics. (not the wheel though fuck the wheel. sensory nightmare). Though I am also an illustrator, painter, and have dabbled in many mediums. Along with all this, I was in a car accident when learning to drive around uhh fifteen i think? And now have a terrible fear of driving, so any commute would be impossible for me unless wherever i lived had good public transit (although even then it stresses me out almost to the point of a panic attack if the bus isnt EXACTLY on time. i need to be on time to things or i get very stressed). I want to eventually (within the next couple years or so ideally) move in with some friends who are also autistic and trans, likely in Los Angeles since thats where two of them live currently and i&amp;#39;m a train ride away from there right now. My current situation is that I live with my older brother(33M) and a roommate we never really see in an two bedroom apartment, my room is just the living room and I feel as though I have no privacy, my door is a curtain and the sloped ceiling means you can see right into my room from the stairs. We&amp;#39;re finally discussing moving after nearly 6 years in this apartment, but im just so tired of it. In an ideal world, I would be able to sustain myself by selling my art, mainly my sculptures, but I cant exactly do that with no backup plan. If (hopefully when) I move in with friends, I want to look for a ceramics studio nearby and keep creating, but of course it costs money to join a studio. (im currently creating at my grandmas ceramics club at her old folks community)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I guess my question is, does anyone know how to go about searching for remote jobs that someone who has inconsistent sleep patterns and feels dizzy most of the time could manage? I feel like my physical condition is only getting worse, and I dont want to be that person who freeloads off my friends, especially when they all have their own struggles. Sorry for rambling so much but I feel helpless, even all I said here feels like it doesnt encapsulate the whole situation, but oh well, i dont want to make people read my whole life story. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Part 1:\n\nHuck Hughes was exactly what you’d expect from a televangelist. If nothing else he was loud and bright and projected an oily charisma. You might have even heard of him—Big Huck and his Big Tent. *Three days of healing and wonders,* *perfumes of delight*, and of course *transformation awaits!*\n\nBack before the Big Tent, I wouldn’t have given the jargon a second thought. \n\nPerfumes of delight? Try a ten-hour shift of sweat, tree sap, motor grease and four-day-old coffee—then get back to me about your otherworldly aromas.\n\nI’d get off work and stomp the sawdust from my boots on the doorstep. Lived alone in the downstairs apartment of a duplex, which was practically a basement. I ate a cheap breakfast at my favorite gas station every morning, spent the day at the lumberyard and on the drive home stopped at the same gas station for dinner. That was the extent of my life. Finishing each day chugging beer until I blacked out in front of the TV.\n\nNot to mention my gimpy walk. \n\nGot my right leg smashed in a car crash, one I may or may not have been responsible for. I was just a teenager hammered out of my mind with a few buddies. Every day since, for six years, I’ve lived with the consequences of that little joy ride, limping around like some pirate of the Idaho panhandle.\n\nI hated it. Hated when people noticed. Hated being insecure about my limp in the first place. The older guys I worked with had missing teeth and fingers, hernias and broken noses, but none of it seemed to bother them so much. I hated that too.\n\nIt was a rainy Sunday evening when my leg, and my life, changed forever. \n\nI cracked a beer and sank into the cushion of my La-Z-Boy, turning up the TV. I always left it on during my days off—I liked the noise, a background babble that made the apartment feel a little less empty. I sat and flipped through the channels. \n\nA bomb strike on Fox News. \n\nA bilingual PBS special. \n\nA celebrity scandal. \n\nA bouncing pair of tits. \n\nA bouncing pair of cartoon frogs. \n\nEverything and nothing spinning across my eyes like a slot machine—click, click, click, click.\n\nThen I landed on Huck Hughes. He was too ridiculous to look away from. Like I was watching the parody of a parody of a televangelist, an apparition living inside a grainy, color-bleed screen. Behind him hung heavy gold curtains and banners, and there was a full band playing just outside the stage light.\n\nBig Huck lived up to his name. He probably stood at six and a half feet tall and was enormous all the way around. Somehow the man crammed himself into a pearly white two-piece suit with a gold tie and gold shoes. His fake teeth shone, clearly a size too large to fit in his mouth—thus a self-inflicted lisp. A flamboyant combover swept across his head, adding another six inches to his height. Big Huck was a lot of man oozing with a lot of personality.\n\nThe televangelist strutted to and fro across the stage, his face leaking sweat.\n\n“Who else but you?” Big Huck demanded. He waved a ring-choked hand over the studio audience. “Who else can welcome the Light On High into your heart? Lift you out from darkness? No man can do it for you. No other hands but your own can unlock the door to your being, yessir—throw it open, I say! Sweep aside the dust and mildew of your iniquities. Oh, power. Oh, sweet power waiting to be given. Garb yourself in purity, and perfumes of delight—or be stranded in the filth of this world. Yessir.”\n\nI switched the channel. \n\nBlood sprayed on red snow, a guy feeding a leg into a woodchipper. \n\nClick.\n\nA European soccer team celebrating on the field as crowds roared.\n\nClick.\n\nSpanish soap opera. The woman was spiking a drink with poison, most likely intended for her wealthy husband.\n\nClick.\n\nBig Huck was shaking his head. “Violence. Distraction. Adultery. These are the paths of the unclean. The glitterings of false gold under your feet, as the river of mud and deception carries you further from the Light On High.” \n\nI searched through a few more channels—then paused. There should’ve been another ninety channels before I circled back. It was close to 7 PM, just early enough to demolish another six-pack. Truth be told, I found myself tempted to finish Huck Hughes’ program, to see what kind of spectacle it had in store. There wasn’t much else worth watching.\n\nNah. I decided life was too short to spend it chasing salvation—especially from someone like Big Huck. If he really was some American prophet, the very voice of God Himself, then God was a double-patty cheeseburger.\n\nThere had to be a game on somewhere. I switched the channel.\n\n“Answer me this!” Big Huck continued, dabbing a towel across his face. “Is there no love left in the heart of mankind? Nothing? None, no sir! Know a man by his fruit—tell me then, what have you done in life that warrants such apathy, such disdain for ascendance? If your mortal flesh be squeezed, crushed in the grip of the Light, what quality of blood would drip from its heavenly fingers? Sweetness? Delight? Or, no, the sour fluids of a soul wasted. Yessir. Yessir…”\n\nI turned off the TV. In the lamplit dim of my apartment, rain slapping against the windows, I could still see that large man strutting around in my head. My Sundays were hardly ever so interesting. I got up and stumped over to the fridge and unearthed the second six-pack. \n\n*Click*. Light washed over my back and organ music filled the room. I slowly turned and stared at the TV.\n\n“The Light does not wish to overlook a single soul.” Big Huck’s voice was nearly a plea. “Why wouldn’t you welcome the Light On High? Such a power desires your transformation. Your glorious integration. A great changing! Yessir! Sweetness and love shall swell in your veins. Love, you shall secrete. Yessir. Believe, believe in its power—or prostitute yourself to the darkness.”\n\nHolding the beer case under my arm, I snatched the remote and shut the TV off again.\n\nI felt a little stupid as I stood in front of the TV, waiting to see what it would do next. Nothing—just a dark screen.\n\nAll right. There couldn’t be more than five minutes left of the program. I could finish it and joke about it with my coworkers tomorrow. More than likely they’ve heard of the fat bastard too. I sat back down, popped open a beer, and thumbed the clicker. \n\nBig Huck was red-faced and panting. I didn’t even want to imagine what that two-piece suit smelled like.\n\n“So be it,” he continued, “the blustering of a man is in the end only wind, without the lungs of the Light On High behind him. A hiss in grass. A whisper filtered through dead leaves. I am only trying to save you, yessir. Save you for the greatest delights. But you out there won’t open your eyes. Lift yourselves up. It weighs terribly on me. I weep for every soul out there who has not yet tasted such power.”\n\nI grunted. “Yeah, sure you do Huck.”\n\n“I do, I really do.”\n\nThat didn’t feel good. Not one bit. My hand hovered over the remote, but I waited a little longer than I should have.\n\n“What must I do? What can this mere apostle, this mere vessel of the flesh do that will right your crooked ways? I see it in your eyes, children. See the suffering. The brokenness. The pathetic drag of your feet in the face of divinity. Oh, it burns a hole in my heart.”\n\n“I think that’s just the nacho bowls, Huck.”\n\nThe televangelist turned his eyes toward the TV. “Mock the Light, all of its love and beauty. Filthied souls have always done so—out of fear. Dreading what could be, if you only believed. I can make you believe, child. I may be a lowly servant of the Light, but there is power given to me. Delegated. Yessir. All one must do is ask. Open the door and make a way.”\n\nNow I was getting angry. The nerve of this guy—wherever those nerves were buried inside his fat ass. I polished off another beer, crushed the can, tossed it to the floor and cracked open the next one.\n\n“Will you open the door, child?” Big Huck asked.\n\n“I ain’t stopping yah.”\n\n“Will you let the Light On High lift you?”\n\n“*Go for it*, tubby.”\n\nSudden relief passed over his face. \n\nThe screen collapsed to hissing static, a NO SIGNAL hovered in the top right corner. I sat there on my chair with a cold beer in my hand. I tested buttons on the remote. Power, up arrow, down arrow, volume, settings—all dead. \n\n“That’s just peachy.”\n\nFor a moment, I might’ve seen dark circles peering through the white noise.\n\nA pulse shot up my right leg.\n\nIt hurt. Hurt like nothing I could remember—not since the crash. An electric throb, pulsing every few seconds, stabbing up from my toes to my groin. I was on the floor. My hands were clasped onto my thigh. I hurt too much to scream, to breathe.  \n\nA faint shimmer of light closed around my leg.\n\nThen the pain ceased, leaving me with snot and tears and cold sweat dripping from my face. Spilled beer soaked my jeans. Gritting my teeth, I turned my eyes back to the TV.\n\nEmerging from the static was Huck Hughes again, seated beside a woman on illustrious sofa chairs. Both of them stared into the studio camera, their smiles white and wide as the static-distorted outro music played.\n\n“We are so garsh darn pleased you’ve joined us today,” Big Huck said. “It’s always a pleasure to spend another Sunday evening with all of you. Sharing our ascendance toward the heavenly, the chance of immortality. Yessir. A delight. Nothing sweeter.” He reached out his hand and took the woman’s. “Well, that is, except for my lovely Julee here.”\n\nMrs. Hughes was a bizarre specimen in her own right. She wore a matching pearl-white pantsuit, her hands and throat glittering with a variety of gemstone rings and bracelets. Heavy makeup. Heavy eyelids. And rising from her head like a cosmetic whirlwind was a heap of blonde hair. “Oh, Big Huck,” she replied, squeezing his large, glove mitt of a hand, “they should’ve named you Big Ol’ Rascal.”\n\nI blinked away tears. Finding what strength I had, I crawled onto my rear and leaned upright against the chair. I was breathing hard and my head was spinning. I felt like I’d just come out of a nasty fever.\n\n“Now,” she began, “we really do appreciate all the kind words you send in every week.” Julee revealed an envelope, taking out the letter and holding it up to read aloud—but her dilated eyes never left the camera. “This one is from a dear follower all the way out in Whitefish, Montana. It says:\n\n*Dear Mr. and Mrs. Hughes, of On High Ministry,*\n\n*I’m writing to your program to let you know that Huck Hughes’ sermon last month has done wonders for me and my husband. That last several years have been a trial. It’s so hard to be left in want, while so many others have. But the promise of Big Huck has not failed us. Praise be the Light On High!*\n\n*It was painful at first. Excruciating, if I may be a little honest. The blood kept flowing and flowing, until all I could do was sit day and night in our bathtub. But I believed. So did my husband. We knew the will of the Light On High never strayed. I am overjoyed to tell you that my husband and I have finally conceived a child. Praise be the power that felt through me, transformed my insides and made me feel things that I’d never felt before.*\n\n*Yes. Oh yes.*\n\n*Before I drag things on, I just want to thank your ministry.*\n\n*A believer, Shannon J.*\n\n*P.S. … Huck’s a strong name for a boy. And Julee would be a lovely name for a girl. I guess we’ll find out!”*\n\nJulee Hughes set the letter aside. “My oh my, wasn’t that just the most delectable testimony from our child, Shannon?”\n\nBig Huck nodded vigorously. “Yessir! Thank you for sharing that kind word with us today—Julee and I thrive off such wonderful testimonies.”\n\nThe background organ melody arrived to a gentle lilt, then its music swelled louder.\n\n“Look at the time,” Big Huck said. “It’s a pity that our program has to end so soon—but don’t you worry! We’ll see you again next Sunday, at 6 o’clock, as sure as ever. Yessir.”\n\nJulee chuckled. “We wouldn’t dare miss it.”\n\n“Certainly not. Now, as we conclude, please feel free to write us your own letter and tell us what the Light On High has done for you. It’s always a delight. Thank you again—and be well, my dear children.”\n\nStatic wavered across the screen.  \n\nWhen the signal corrected itself, there was a bald dude with insanely thick eyebrows who was peddling a life-changing brand of vacuum cleaners. I ran my hands down my leg. I couldn’t make sense of it. There had been a place, a void—a blinding spotlight I never meant to step into.\n\n— — —\n\nNeedless to say, I chugged the rest of the six-pack and got completely shitfaced.\n\nClocking in the next morning, I suffered a hangover—my head ached and I was down bad with rot-gut. Tempted as I was to call out, I was already skating on thin ice with my boss and couldn’t risk it. Buzzing saws, clattering boards, forklifts beeping—I wanted to find some dark corner in the lumberyard and sleep in it.\n\nWhile I was forcing down lunch, the foreman—an old guy named Pete—walked over and offered me a bottle of blue Gatorade. \n\n“Hurting bad, eh?” he said.\n\nI nodded.\n\n“The swill always catches up with yah.”\n\nI nodded again.\n\n“You ain’t limpin’ though.”\n\nI resisted taking that as an insult. “Oh yeah?”\n\n“I mean it, kid. You’ve been moving around just fine. What happened?”\n\n“I…” the answer didn’t come to me, not right away. I glanced down at my right leg. Sheepishly, I tested a few steps over to the coffee machine. Damn. *Damn.*\n\nPete had himself a laugh. “Must’ve been those ‘physical therapy’ cassettes you’ve talked about getting.”\n\n“I was just bullshitting, Pete. I never bought any tapes.”\n\n“I’d already figured that. Well, you ain’t hobbling anymore—that’s plain to see.”\n\nI planted my hands on the rec table, lifted my right leg and lightly swung it back and forth. Smooth. “Pete. Have you ever watched a TV preacher named Huck Hughes?”\n\n“Ahh. I don’t much care for that stuff. Dime-a-dozen, I say. Years back, I had a shouting match with Lora when she’d mailed $100 to one group. You know how it is. They trot out pictures of starving Africans and booger-eyed puppies, just to loosen up your wallet.”\n\n“But have you heard of Huck Hughes?”\n\n“I wouldn’t remember even if I had. What’s up with you, Red?”\n\n“Oh, nothing. Just saw him on the TV.”\n\nJust talking about it had a cold sweat break across my back. Should I tell him? No, he’d just make fun of me—and I couldn’t blame him. Somehow my gimp leg still found new ways of causing me grief. I decided against telling Pete or anyone else about the miracle.\n\nBut I needed to find out more about this Big Huck.\n\nThe week ground on and my questions stewed all the while. I just wanted Saturday to arrive. Believe it or not I was taking it easy on the drinking—too nervous, my skin recoiled at the thought of reliving last Sunday in any way. The only thing that felt right about this whole situation was my damn leg. Every evening I tested it: stretching, crouching, lunges and jumping. \n\nIt was like I’d never been in that car crash.\n\nSaturday finally came around. I hit the gas station for breakfast and then drove my pickup straight to the only broadcast station I knew of. \n\nI knocked on the front doors and waited. There came shuffling along a thin middle-aged man holding a thermos. He was the broadcast technician, and after tediously describing the ins and outs of his job, he remembered to introduce himself.\n\n“Anyhoo,” Carter said. “How can I help you?”\n\n“I had questions about a program you play from here.”\n\n“I see. I’d wager you’re referring to On High Ministry?”\n\n“How’d you know?”\n\nI winced at the coffee breath as Carter laughed. “That’s the only program anyone ever asks about! It tends to get people all excited. I know because a good deal of them show up here at the station, demanding to know this or that. So come in and have a cup of coffee.”\n\nI followed him into the station and sat amid a disaster of cables, computers and stacked shelves of electronics that was Carter’s rack-room. Through an interior window, I watched a man in a recording booth, flipping through papers and talking into a mic. A mug of microwaved coffee was shoved into my hands.\n\n“You also do radio?” I asked Carter.\n\nCarter sat across from me, a little too close, and waved a dismissive hand. “Oh, believe me, in an operation as small as ours we do a little of everything. That’s Robert Meyers in the studio there. You’ve probably heard him answer phone calls on the party-line on Tuesdays. Town events. Local interviews. And so on. He’s decent enough at it. Has that sorta voice, you know? Unobtrusive. Oaky sounding. That said, Rob would be helpless as a newborn if I unplugged his mic. So he better behave—that’s what I always tell him.” Carter blinked absentmindedly, then shook his head. “What was your question?”\n\n“I’m asking about Huck Hughes and On High Ministry.”\n\n“Right, right, right—Mr. Hughes and his crew.”\n\nCarter stood and rummaged through cabinets and paper piles in the back. He returned with a folded yellow flyer and handed it to me. \n\n“They moved here from the Midwest,” Carter explained. “Now and then I talk with his people—station licenses and details like that.”\n\n“Have you ever *watched* his show?”\n\n“Oh I’m positive I had at some point. Just to familiarize myself with their program. Wouldn’t be professional if I didn’t—not after meeting the guy.”\n\nMy chair squeaked as I leaned forward. “So you’ve actually *met* Big Huck?”\n\n“Of course! Didn’t I already tell you that? We had Mr. Hughes right here in the studio.”  Carter directed his thermos at Robert Meyers behind the window. “Had an interview and everything. That was when On High Ministry first settled in Idaho… ohhh, I don’t remember… five years ago? I’ll tell you this, Mr. Hughes is much larger than he looks on the television. Rob looked like a child sitting in the booth with him.”\n\nI unfolded the paper and laid it out on the desk beside us. Carter and I leaned in, studying the flyer together. The face of Big Huck smiled up from the paper. *TENT REVIVAL… Three day event… Healing and wonders… Valentine, Nebraska.*\n\nAgain I felt utterly in over my head. What was my plan, anyhow? Track down Big Huck and shake his hand, grateful that my leg was healed? Why else would I be out here? I didn’t know, but there was a knot in my stomach that wouldn’t allow my questions to rest. I folded the flyer and jammed it into my pocket.\n\nCarter was talking again. “I can have him come and talk if you’d like.”\n\n“Big Huck?”\n\n“No, no—*Robert*. He’s more involved in these things than I am.”\n\n“That’d be good,” I replied. “How long will I have to wait?”\n\n“Oh, no time at all.” Carter stood and smacked the booth’s window with a clipboard. “Hey. HEY. Rob, someone here for you.”\n\nInside the booth, Rob turned and stared murder at Carter, then finished whatever he was saying into the mic. He tossed aside his headphones and stormed out of the studio. \n\n“It’s fine,” Carter told me. “I can just run some old segments for the while, if need be. It’s radio. No one notices anyway.”\n\nRobert Meyers joined us in the rack-room. He was bald and very stout, his skin a lobsterish tanning-bed color. “For the love of God, Cart,” he said, “believe it or not we are paid to work here. I can’t just drop mic every time—who’s this?”\n\n“My name’s Red,” I answered.\n\nHe quickly shook my hand. “How goes it? I’m Rob. I’d love to chat with a new face but I have exactly three minutes—got an interview with the sheriff. Tell me what you need.”\n\n“I’m trying to learn about Huck Hughes.”\n\n“Ah God, this again—look, Rudy, I’m sure you have some miracle or curse or tales of voodoo you’re just dying to talk about. So has every other visitor here at the station. I liked Mr. Hughes. I’m not a hellfire and holy-roller type of guy but I’d admit his show has its charm—like one of those novelty shops you check out on vacation. So there. Listen to me, I found Mr. Hughes to be nothing but a happy-go-lucky man and a true conversationalist—unlike everybody else in a 100-mile radius. Leave him alone. Leave On High Ministry alone. The last thing we need is another lunatic with a gun looking for Hughes. Got it, Ray? Capisce? *Fantastic*. Nice meeting you. \n\nRobert Meyers jogged back out the door, reappearing in the studio booth and put on his headphones.\n\n“He seemed upset,” I said.     \n\n“When is Rob *not* upset?” Carter muttered. “Well I… I think it’s time I get back to work. Someone’s gotta run this place and it certainly isn’t our radio host. I hate to ask you to leave, Red. But I’m glad you stopped by. Good chat. You do remember the way out, don’t you?”\n\n— — —\n\nI couldn’t sleep that night. I lay in bed wide awake and listened to the muffled sound of cars driving by. It was around 3 AM when I gave up and climbed out of bed, and even then, I just ended up staring at the flyer pinned to my fridge. *Healing and wonders…*\n\nI held out until 1 PM—past the typical church time—before knocking on my landlord’s front door. Connie was an elderly woman who lived alone in the apartment above me. She tolerated me as her tenant but that was about all. I drank too much. I watched television with the volume turned to high. Once, she'd discovered me lying blacked out in her flower bed. But I paid rent and until I didn’t Connie was stuck with me. \n\nShe cracked the door open a few inches and gave me a distasteful look. “What do *you* want?”\n\n“I need to use your computer—uh, please.”\n\n“What for?”\n\n“I need to look something up on the net.”\n\nShe scowled. “It isn’t dirty pictures, is it? Just this month I had my great nephew visit, and I caught him looking at bathing suit models while I was cooking meatloaf. Why don’t you just drive to the library? You might find an honest to God wife there.”\n\n“It’s Sunday, Connie. The library isn’t open. I swear to everything holy it’ll only take five minutes. It’s important.”\n\n“Oh, of that I’m sure. I suppose you can barge in—take those filthy boots off before you do.”\n\nA legion of dead-eyed ceramic kittens and dogs stared at me from carefully arranged shelves as I followed Connie into her living room. The carpet was thick and very yellow, streaked methodically from a fresh vacuum. Old family photos and needlework covered the walls. In a far corner sat a wire bird cage that’d been empty since I first moved in. Connie led me to the computer and eyed me with suspicion as I took a seat.\n\nDial-up screeched and toned. After I was able to open Internet Explorer, I sat there awkwardly and waited for my landlord to leave. \n\n“Go ahead,” Connie said. “But I’m not allowing smut into this household. I’m not going to offer you tea, either. You promised five minutes and that’s all you are going to get.”\n\nNothing surprising there. I typed in On High Ministry and clicked search. A list of website links trudged down the screen. I clicked on a news website that sounded familiar.\n\nTELEVANGELIST SHOT in small town diner. Suspect in custody and charged for ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. 5/12/97.\n\nSUSPECT of shooting, Gregory J. Tindall, CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. 11/23/97.\n\nSHOT TELEVANGELIST fully recovers after second heart surgery, tells press he ‘HOPES MR. TINDALL EMBRACES THE LIGHT’. 1/05/98.\n\nI selected the second link with the name *Gregory J. Tindall*.\n\nAfter another uncomfortable minute of Connie squinting over my shoulder, the article loaded on the screen. I’d barely finished the third paragraph when a headshot of Huck Hughes appeared alongside the article—a delighted, bleach-white smile on his face.\n\nI was startled when Connie cried out: “Why! That’s Big Huck on the computer!”\n\n“You know who he is?” I asked.\n\n“I just *adore* Big Huck.” Connie clasped her liver-spotted hands together. “I watch his program every Sunday. That man is exactly what this nation needs right now—what with the president acting so horribly in the Oval Office. To think this whole time, the very Whore of Babylon herself was crouched under his desk. I nearly died in my chair when the news broke. That’s when I found Big Huck on the TV. He won me over immediately, just seeing the man preach about purity and powers of the Light On High. I’ll tell you right now, young man, I thought I had my way to the afterlife figured out until Big Huck came along. ‘The Light will lift you’, he says. ‘You have to be pure enough to float, if the Light chooses you.’”\n\n“Wait, wait. Do you know about the shooting?”\n\n“How could I forget? That dreadful man shot poor ol’ Big Huck square in the chest. Raving and spouting nonsense. You know what, I heard on good authority that he was secretly worshipping the devil. But even the devil couldn’t stop Big Huck! He’s a strong man… very strong.”\n\n“What happened to the shooter? Tindall? Where’s he?”\n\nConnie gave me a satisfied smirk. “He’s where the Light doesn’t shine. If attempted murder isn’t enough to end up in Hell, then suicide is. They found him hanging in his cell. Mind you, this was all the talk at the time—” she paused, looking at me with realization. “I’ll be! Red, you’ve been watching his program, haven’t you! Such a wonderful thing to hear. Just what someone like you needs. I should’ve guessed it—watching you come home every day without a lick of booze on you.”\n\n“You’ve been *spying* on me?”\n\n“Oh, of course I have. But now you’re on your way to the Light On High! I’m so very proud of you—here, here, do you need some tea?”\n\nConnie was in such a fit of joy I was a little nervous she’d keel over from a heart attack. I accepted the offer just to get some time alone. I skimmed all three articles and was disappointed with each—except finding out that Gregory Tindall had driven to Idaho from northern Nebraska. That was definitely something. Before I left, I asked Connie if she’d experienced any miracles watching Big Huck on TV. She rambled about hip pains, headaches, blurry spots in her vision, her heart and so on—often contradicting herself. \n\nI had a few sips of jasmine tea with Connie, then escaped further conversation with a lie about an oil change.\n\nSo, On High Ministry had moved to Idaho and, apparently, they had dragged along undesirable baggage—Gregory Tindall, in this case—with them. \n\nI sank into my chair downstairs and mulled everything over—nothing close to a revelation coming to me. Four hours before Big Huck would broadcast. I couldn’t stand to just sit in my apartment and wait.\n\nI’d gotten ten feet out the door when I stumbled a step. A pulse in my right leg. Then a second and a third.\n\nThere wasn’t the agonizing throb I’d been subjected to last Sunday—just an uncomfortable echo of that pain. I stood bent over, my hands pressed to my leg, hoping the sensation would pass. I was afraid. Stunned. Like I’d been caught in the jaws of an invisible spring-trap, my leg the thing that held me fast. When the sensation finally vanished, I straightened and wiped the sweat from my forehead.\n\nI tested my leg as I continued walking, finding nothing wrong with it even as I climbed into my pickup. With my hands on the steering wheel, I sat there for a while and tried thinking of an explanation for all of this. This shouldn’t be possible. And I shouldn't have any reason to fear a two-bit televangelist on TV. Behind the window blinds upstairs, I caught Connie peeking down at me through a narrow slat. \n\nFor an hour I just drove along the road, filling time. I passed through a few neighborhoods, rolled through downtown, and even the back roads. I just followed the yellow lines on the pavement.\n\nIt’s pathetic to admit, but half a decade with a bum leg gave me a reason to be who I was. It justified the resentment, hate, guilt and my constant drinking in the first place. Without it, I didn’t know what was really left of me. For the time being, at least, I could focus all my unease and frustration on the cause of my healing.\n\nI slammed the brakes. The full weight of my truck lurched to a stop.\n\nA woman leaped back from my pickup, shouting at me. She looked younger than I was, with large glasses and her sandy hair clumped in a bun. A denim jacket hung baggy on her. There was a bright orange tattoo on the side of her neck—flowers, maybe. A chunky camcorder slung on a strap over her shoulder.\n\nShe flipped me the bird and finished crossing the street. I let my heart settle again, then carried on my way.\n\nFinally, I made a decision—shitfaced it is. I rolled up to the only bar open on Sunday, sat alone on a bar stool, slapped money on the counter and worked my way down a bottle of Jameson. It hit me hard and it hit me good. Thankfully the bar owner, Buddy, had the decency to kick me out the door after I admitted that I’d pissed all over the urinal. I was swerving a little on the drive home, here and there, and accidentally flattened a squirrel. Felt bad about that. Stumbling out of my pickup, I tried my best to appear sober as I walked to my apartment.\n\nThe fear was creeping over me again. I’d hoped a sufficient dunk in liquor might have solved that, but far from it. 6 PM was inevitably drawing near.\n\n5:45… 5:55…\n\nI staggered over to the fridge and snatched a beer. Chugged it and then helped myself to another, just to be safe. Holding the remote in my hand, I tried to think of all the alternatives to watching the Sunday program. I could simply *not* do it. I could just go to bed and escape this unpleasant dream I’d found myself stuck in.\n\nClick.\n\nA title card was on the screen: *Way of the Light On High, with Huck Hughes.*\n\nAfter a minute of band music, the title card faded to a viewing of the same stage as last week. Big Huck stood attired in his pearly-white suit. He flashed a smile at the TV. My head was spinning, blurring his large face and smearing it from side to side on the television screen.\n\n“It’s a delight to have you join us again,” he began. “But before we begin this evening, I have some special news for all of you. Something real special that’s been on my heart for some time now. *Yessir*.”\n\nBig Huck struck a pose of profound contemplation, hands on his podium.\n\n“We’ve been living here in the Gem State for a handful of years now—a plain wonderful time shared with you. You’ve all seen my face. Heard me preach and watched me labor tirelessly to grow the Light’s influence. Shed this world of its filth, of distaste. Yessir. *Yessir*. But finding myself blessed to inhabit such an auspicious role of leader, a herald of the Light On High and things unseen… it can sure leave a big-hearted man like myself feeling a sense of lack. An empty grasp. So! My wife Julee and I are overjoyed to announce that we’re hosting a three day event. *Big Huck’s Big Tent*. Yessir! Praise be! Fellowship and transformations! Healing and wonders! I, a humble servant of the Light On High, will finally have the pleasures of looking upon each and every one of your faces. How I crave it.”\n\nMy stomach churned at the thought—or maybe it was just the liquor sloshing inside of me. I felt sick. Acid burned the back of my throat. I slid off my chair and sat on the floor. I wish I hadn’t drank, not now. My mind reached for anything to hold onto but came up empty. \n\nOn High Ministry. The old flyer. Nebraska. Gregory Tindall. Big Huck shot. The Light On High. Miracles. My leg. My leg. My piece of shit gimp leg, fixed through a television. Big Huck.\n\nHe was still blathering away on the TV, most of it slipping past my comprehension. I made myself listen.  \n\n“The Light On High will not wait long, I assure you. Yessir. I will see you all in Ponderay.”\n\nPonderay.\n\n*Here.*\n\nI vomited on the carpet.",

If nothing else he was loud and bright and projected an oily charisma. You might have even heard of him—Big Huck and his Big Tent. &lt;em&gt;Three days of healing and wonders,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;perfumes of delight&lt;/em&gt;, and of course &lt;em&gt;transformation awaits!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Back before the Big Tent, I wouldn’t have given the jargon a second thought. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Perfumes of delight? Try a ten-hour shift of sweat, tree sap, motor grease and four-day-old coffee—then get back to me about your otherworldly aromas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’d get off work and stomp the sawdust from my boots on the doorstep. Lived alone in the downstairs apartment of a duplex, which was practically a basement. I ate a cheap breakfast at my favorite gas station every morning, spent the day at the lumberyard and on the drive home stopped at the same gas station for dinner. That was the extent of my life. Finishing each day chugging beer until I blacked out in front of the TV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to mention my gimpy walk. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Got my right leg smashed in a car crash, one I may or may not have been responsible for. I was just a teenager hammered out of my mind with a few buddies. Every day since, for six years, I’ve lived with the consequences of that little joy ride, limping around like some pirate of the Idaho panhandle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hated it. Hated when people noticed. Hated being insecure about my limp in the first place. The older guys I worked with had missing teeth and fingers, hernias and broken noses, but none of it seemed to bother them so much. I hated that too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a rainy Sunday evening when my leg, and my life, changed forever. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I cracked a beer and sank into the cushion of my La-Z-Boy, turning up the TV. I always left it on during my days off—I liked the noise, a background babble that made the apartment feel a little less empty. I sat and flipped through the channels. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bomb strike on Fox News. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bilingual PBS special. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A celebrity scandal. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bouncing pair of tits. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A bouncing pair of cartoon frogs. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everything and nothing spinning across my eyes like a slot machine—click, click, click, click.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I landed on Huck Hughes. He was too ridiculous to look away from. Like I was watching the parody of a parody of a televangelist, an apparition living inside a grainy, color-bleed screen. Behind him hung heavy gold curtains and banners, and there was a full band playing just outside the stage light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big Huck lived up to his name. He probably stood at six and a half feet tall and was enormous all the way around. Somehow the man crammed himself into a pearly white two-piece suit with a gold tie and gold shoes. His fake teeth shone, clearly a size too large to fit in his mouth—thus a self-inflicted lisp. A flamboyant combover swept across his head, adding another six inches to his height. Big Huck was a lot of man oozing with a lot of personality.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The televangelist strutted to and fro across the stage, his face leaking sweat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Who else but you?” Big Huck demanded. He waved a ring-choked hand over the studio audience. “Who else can welcome the Light On High into your heart? Lift you out from darkness? No man can do it for you. No other hands but your own can unlock the door to your being, yessir—throw it open, I say! Sweep aside the dust and mildew of your iniquities. Oh, power. Oh, sweet power waiting to be given. Garb yourself in purity, and perfumes of delight—or be stranded in the filth of this world. Yessir.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I switched the channel. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blood sprayed on red snow, a guy feeding a leg into a woodchipper. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Click.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A European soccer team celebrating on the field as crowds roared.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Click.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Spanish soap opera. The woman was spiking a drink with poison, most likely intended for her wealthy husband.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Click.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big Huck was shaking his head. “Violence. Distraction. Adultery. These are the paths of the unclean. The glitterings of false gold under your feet, as the river of mud and deception carries you further from the Light On High.” &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I searched through a few more channels—then paused. There should’ve been another ninety channels before I circled back. It was close to 7 PM, just early enough to demolish another six-pack. Truth be told, I found myself tempted to finish Huck Hughes’ program, to see what kind of spectacle it had in store. There wasn’t much else worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nah. I decided life was too short to spend it chasing salvation—especially from someone like Big Huck. If he really was some American prophet, the very voice of God Himself, then God was a double-patty cheeseburger.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There had to be a game on somewhere. I switched the channel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Answer me this!” Big Huck continued, dabbing a towel across his face. “Is there no love left in the heart of mankind? Nothing? None, no sir! Know a man by his fruit—tell me then, what have you done in life that warrants such apathy, such disdain for ascendance? If your mortal flesh be squeezed, crushed in the grip of the Light, what quality of blood would drip from its heavenly fingers? Sweetness? Delight? Or, no, the sour fluids of a soul wasted. Yessir. Yessir…”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned off the TV. In the lamplit dim of my apartment, rain slapping against the windows, I could still see that large man strutting around in my head. My Sundays were hardly ever so interesting. I got up and stumped over to the fridge and unearthed the second six-pack. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click&lt;/em&gt;. Light washed over my back and organ music filled the room. I slowly turned and stared at the TV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The Light does not wish to overlook a single soul.” Big Huck’s voice was nearly a plea. “Why wouldn’t you welcome the Light On High? Such a power desires your transformation. Your glorious integration. A great changing! Yessir! Sweetness and love shall swell in your veins. Love, you shall secrete. Yessir. Believe, believe in its power—or prostitute yourself to the darkness.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holding the beer case under my arm, I snatched the remote and shut the TV off again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt a little stupid as I stood in front of the TV, waiting to see what it would do next. Nothing—just a dark screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;All right. There couldn’t be more than five minutes left of the program. I could finish it and joke about it with my coworkers tomorrow. More than likely they’ve heard of the fat bastard too. I sat back down, popped open a beer, and thumbed the clicker. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big Huck was red-faced and panting. I didn’t even want to imagine what that two-piece suit smelled like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“So be it,” he continued, “the blustering of a man is in the end only wind, without the lungs of the Light On High behind him. A hiss in grass. A whisper filtered through dead leaves. I am only trying to save you, yessir. Save you for the greatest delights. But you out there won’t open your eyes. Lift yourselves up. It weighs terribly on me. I weep for every soul out there who has not yet tasted such power.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I grunted. “Yeah, sure you do Huck.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I do, I really do.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That didn’t feel good. Not one bit. My hand hovered over the remote, but I waited a little longer than I should have.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What must I do? What can this mere apostle, this mere vessel of the flesh do that will right your crooked ways? I see it in your eyes, children. See the suffering. The brokenness. The pathetic drag of your feet in the face of divinity. Oh, it burns a hole in my heart.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I think that’s just the nacho bowls, Huck.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The televangelist turned his eyes toward the TV. “Mock the Light, all of its love and beauty. Filthied souls have always done so—out of fear. Dreading what could be, if you only believed. I can make you believe, child. I may be a lowly servant of the Light, but there is power given to me. Delegated. Yessir. All one must do is ask. Open the door and make a way.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I was getting angry. The nerve of this guy—wherever those nerves were buried inside his fat ass. I polished off another beer, crushed the can, tossed it to the floor and cracked open the next one.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Will you open the door, child?” Big Huck asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I ain’t stopping yah.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Will you let the Light On High lift you?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Go for it&lt;/em&gt;, tubby.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sudden relief passed over his face. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The screen collapsed to hissing static, a NO SIGNAL hovered in the top right corner. I sat there on my chair with a cold beer in my hand. I tested buttons on the remote. Power, up arrow, down arrow, volume, settings—all dead. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s just peachy.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a moment, I might’ve seen dark circles peering through the white noise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A pulse shot up my right leg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It hurt. Hurt like nothing I could remember—not since the crash. An electric throb, pulsing every few seconds, stabbing up from my toes to my groin. I was on the floor. My hands were clasped onto my thigh. I hurt too much to scream, to breathe.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A faint shimmer of light closed around my leg.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then the pain ceased, leaving me with snot and tears and cold sweat dripping from my face. Spilled beer soaked my jeans. Gritting my teeth, I turned my eyes back to the TV.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Emerging from the static was Huck Hughes again, seated beside a woman on illustrious sofa chairs. Both of them stared into the studio camera, their smiles white and wide as the static-distorted outro music played.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We are so garsh darn pleased you’ve joined us today,” Big Huck said. “It’s always a pleasure to spend another Sunday evening with all of you. Sharing our ascendance toward the heavenly, the chance of immortality. Yessir. A delight. Nothing sweeter.” He reached out his hand and took the woman’s. “Well, that is, except for my lovely Julee here.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Hughes was a bizarre specimen in her own right. She wore a matching pearl-white pantsuit, her hands and throat glittering with a variety of gemstone rings and bracelets. Heavy makeup. Heavy eyelids. And rising from her head like a cosmetic whirlwind was a heap of blonde hair. “Oh, Big Huck,” she replied, squeezing his large, glove mitt of a hand, “they should’ve named you Big Ol’ Rascal.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I blinked away tears. Finding what strength I had, I crawled onto my rear and leaned upright against the chair. I was breathing hard and my head was spinning. I felt like I’d just come out of a nasty fever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Now,” she began, “we really do appreciate all the kind words you send in every week.” Julee revealed an envelope, taking out the letter and holding it up to read aloud—but her dilated eyes never left the camera. “This one is from a dear follower all the way out in Whitefish, Montana. It says:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dear Mr. and Mrs. Hughes, of On High Ministry,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m writing to your program to let you know that Huck Hughes’ sermon last month has done wonders for me and my husband. That last several years have been a trial. It’s so hard to be left in want, while so many others have. But the promise of Big Huck has not failed us. Praise be the Light On High!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was painful at first. Excruciating, if I may be a little honest. The blood kept flowing and flowing, until all I could do was sit day and night in our bathtub. But I believed. So did my husband. We knew the will of the Light On High never strayed. I am overjoyed to tell you that my husband and I have finally conceived a child. Praise be the power that felt through me, transformed my insides and made me feel things that I’d never felt before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes. Oh yes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before I drag things on, I just want to thank your ministry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A believer, Shannon J.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S. … Huck’s a strong name for a boy. And Julee would be a lovely name for a girl. I guess we’ll find out!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julee Hughes set the letter aside. “My oh my, wasn’t that just the most delectable testimony from our child, Shannon?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big Huck nodded vigorously. “Yessir! Thank you for sharing that kind word with us today—Julee and I thrive off such wonderful testimonies.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The background organ melody arrived to a gentle lilt, then its music swelled louder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Look at the time,” Big Huck said. “It’s a pity that our program has to end so soon—but don’t you worry! We’ll see you again next Sunday, at 6 o’clock, as sure as ever. Yessir.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Julee chuckled. “We wouldn’t dare miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Certainly not. Now, as we conclude, please feel free to write us your own letter and tell us what the Light On High has done for you. It’s always a delight. Thank you again—and be well, my dear children.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Static wavered across the screen.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the signal corrected itself, there was a bald dude with insanely thick eyebrows who was peddling a life-changing brand of vacuum cleaners. I ran my hands down my leg. I couldn’t make sense of it. There had been a place, a void—a blinding spotlight I never meant to step into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;— — —&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, I chugged the rest of the six-pack and got completely shitfaced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clocking in the next morning, I suffered a hangover—my head ached and I was down bad with rot-gut. Tempted as I was to call out, I was already skating on thin ice with my boss and couldn’t risk it. Buzzing saws, clattering boards, forklifts beeping—I wanted to find some dark corner in the lumberyard and sleep in it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While I was forcing down lunch, the foreman—an old guy named Pete—walked over and offered me a bottle of blue Gatorade. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Hurting bad, eh?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The swill always catches up with yah.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I nodded again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You ain’t limpin’ though.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I resisted taking that as an insult. “Oh yeah?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I mean it, kid. You’ve been moving around just fine. What happened?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I…” the answer didn’t come to me, not right away. I glanced down at my right leg. Sheepishly, I tested a few steps over to the coffee machine. Damn. &lt;em&gt;Damn.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pete had himself a laugh. “Must’ve been those ‘physical therapy’ cassettes you’ve talked about getting.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I was just bullshitting, Pete. I never bought any tapes.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’d already figured that. Well, you ain’t hobbling anymore—that’s plain to see.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I planted my hands on the rec table, lifted my right leg and lightly swung it back and forth. Smooth. “Pete. Have you ever watched a TV preacher named Huck Hughes?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Ahh. I don’t much care for that stuff. Dime-a-dozen, I say. Years back, I had a shouting match with Lora when she’d mailed $100 to one group. You know how it is. They trot out pictures of starving Africans and booger-eyed puppies, just to loosen up your wallet.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“But have you heard of Huck Hughes?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I wouldn’t remember even if I had. What’s up with you, Red?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, nothing. Just saw him on the TV.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just talking about it had a cold sweat break across my back. Should I tell him? No, he’d just make fun of me—and I couldn’t blame him. Somehow my gimp leg still found new ways of causing me grief. I decided against telling Pete or anyone else about the miracle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I needed to find out more about this Big Huck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The week ground on and my questions stewed all the while. I just wanted Saturday to arrive. Believe it or not I was taking it easy on the drinking—too nervous, my skin recoiled at the thought of reliving last Sunday in any way. The only thing that felt right about this whole situation was my damn leg. Every evening I tested it: stretching, crouching, lunges and jumping. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was like I’d never been in that car crash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Saturday finally came around. I hit the gas station for breakfast and then drove my pickup straight to the only broadcast station I knew of. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I knocked on the front doors and waited. There came shuffling along a thin middle-aged man holding a thermos. He was the broadcast technician, and after tediously describing the ins and outs of his job, he remembered to introduce himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Anyhoo,” Carter said. “How can I help you?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I had questions about a program you play from here.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I see. I’d wager you’re referring to On High Ministry?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“How’d you know?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I winced at the coffee breath as Carter laughed. “That’s the only program anyone ever asks about! It tends to get people all excited. I know because a good deal of them show up here at the station, demanding to know this or that. So come in and have a cup of coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I followed him into the station and sat amid a disaster of cables, computers and stacked shelves of electronics that was Carter’s rack-room. Through an interior window, I watched a man in a recording booth, flipping through papers and talking into a mic. A mug of microwaved coffee was shoved into my hands.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You also do radio?” I asked Carter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carter sat across from me, a little too close, and waved a dismissive hand. “Oh, believe me, in an operation as small as ours we do a little of everything. That’s Robert Meyers in the studio there. You’ve probably heard him answer phone calls on the party-line on Tuesdays. Town events. Local interviews. And so on. He’s decent enough at it. Has that sorta voice, you know? Unobtrusive. Oaky sounding. That said, Rob would be helpless as a newborn if I unplugged his mic. So he better behave—that’s what I always tell him.” Carter blinked absentmindedly, then shook his head. “What was your question?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m asking about Huck Hughes and On High Ministry.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Right, right, right—Mr. Hughes and his crew.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carter stood and rummaged through cabinets and paper piles in the back. He returned with a folded yellow flyer and handed it to me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“They moved here from the Midwest,” Carter explained. “Now and then I talk with his people—station licenses and details like that.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Have you ever &lt;em&gt;watched&lt;/em&gt; his show?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh I’m positive I had at some point. Just to familiarize myself with their program. Wouldn’t be professional if I didn’t—not after meeting the guy.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My chair squeaked as I leaned forward. “So you’ve actually &lt;em&gt;met&lt;/em&gt; Big Huck?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Of course! Didn’t I already tell you that? We had Mr. Hughes right here in the studio.”  Carter directed his thermos at Robert Meyers behind the window. “Had an interview and everything. That was when On High Ministry first settled in Idaho… ohhh, I don’t remember… five years ago? I’ll tell you this, Mr. Hughes is much larger than he looks on the television. Rob looked like a child sitting in the booth with him.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I unfolded the paper and laid it out on the desk beside us. Carter and I leaned in, studying the flyer together. The face of Big Huck smiled up from the paper. &lt;em&gt;TENT REVIVAL… Three day event… Healing and wonders… Valentine, Nebraska.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Again I felt utterly in over my head. What was my plan, anyhow? Track down Big Huck and shake his hand, grateful that my leg was healed? Why else would I be out here? I didn’t know, but there was a knot in my stomach that wouldn’t allow my questions to rest. I folded the flyer and jammed it into my pocket.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carter was talking again. “I can have him come and talk if you’d like.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Big Huck?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“No, no—&lt;em&gt;Robert&lt;/em&gt;. He’s more involved in these things than I am.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“That’d be good,” I replied. “How long will I have to wait?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, no time at all.” Carter stood and smacked the booth’s window with a clipboard. “Hey. HEY. Rob, someone here for you.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Inside the booth, Rob turned and stared murder at Carter, then finished whatever he was saying into the mic. He tossed aside his headphones and stormed out of the studio. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s fine,” Carter told me. “I can just run some old segments for the while, if need be. It’s radio. No one notices anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert Meyers joined us in the rack-room. He was bald and very stout, his skin a lobsterish tanning-bed color. “For the love of God, Cart,” he said, “believe it or not we are paid to work here. I can’t just drop mic every time—who’s this?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“My name’s Red,” I answered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He quickly shook my hand. “How goes it? I’m Rob. I’d love to chat with a new face but I have exactly three minutes—got an interview with the sheriff. Tell me what you need.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m trying to learn about Huck Hughes.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Ah God, this again—look, Rudy, I’m sure you have some miracle or curse or tales of voodoo you’re just dying to talk about. So has every other visitor here at the station. I liked Mr. Hughes. I’m not a hellfire and holy-roller type of guy but I’d admit his show has its charm—like one of those novelty shops you check out on vacation. So there. Listen to me, I found Mr. Hughes to be nothing but a happy-go-lucky man and a true conversationalist—unlike everybody else in a 100-mile radius. Leave him alone. Leave On High Ministry alone. The last thing we need is another lunatic with a gun looking for Hughes. Got it, Ray? Capisce? &lt;em&gt;Fantastic&lt;/em&gt;. Nice meeting you. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Robert Meyers jogged back out the door, reappearing in the studio booth and put on his headphones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“He seemed upset,” I said.     &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“When is Rob &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; upset?” Carter muttered. “Well I… I think it’s time I get back to work. Someone’s gotta run this place and it certainly isn’t our radio host. I hate to ask you to leave, Red. But I’m glad you stopped by. Good chat. You do remember the way out, don’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;— — —&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t sleep that night. I lay in bed wide awake and listened to the muffled sound of cars driving by. It was around 3 AM when I gave up and climbed out of bed, and even then, I just ended up staring at the flyer pinned to my fridge. &lt;em&gt;Healing and wonders…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I held out until 1 PM—past the typical church time—before knocking on my landlord’s front door. Connie was an elderly woman who lived alone in the apartment above me. She tolerated me as her tenant but that was about all. I drank too much. I watched television with the volume turned to high. Once, she&amp;#39;d discovered me lying blacked out in her flower bed. But I paid rent and until I didn’t Connie was stuck with me. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She cracked the door open a few inches and gave me a distasteful look. “What do &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I need to use your computer—uh, please.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What for?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I need to look something up on the net.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She scowled. “It isn’t dirty pictures, is it? Just this month I had my great nephew visit, and I caught him looking at bathing suit models while I was cooking meatloaf. Why don’t you just drive to the library? You might find an honest to God wife there.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s Sunday, Connie. The library isn’t open. I swear to everything holy it’ll only take five minutes. It’s important.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, of that I’m sure. I suppose you can barge in—take those filthy boots off before you do.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A legion of dead-eyed ceramic kittens and dogs stared at me from carefully arranged shelves as I followed Connie into her living room. The carpet was thick and very yellow, streaked methodically from a fresh vacuum. Old family photos and needlework covered the walls. In a far corner sat a wire bird cage that’d been empty since I first moved in. Connie led me to the computer and eyed me with suspicion as I took a seat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dial-up screeched and toned. After I was able to open Internet Explorer, I sat there awkwardly and waited for my landlord to leave. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Go ahead,” Connie said. “But I’m not allowing smut into this household. I’m not going to offer you tea, either. You promised five minutes and that’s all you are going to get.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing surprising there. I typed in On High Ministry and clicked search. A list of website links trudged down the screen. I clicked on a news website that sounded familiar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TELEVANGELIST SHOT in small town diner. Suspect in custody and charged for ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. 5/12/97.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SUSPECT of shooting, Gregory J. Tindall, CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED FIRST-DEGREE MURDER. 11/23/97.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;SHOT TELEVANGELIST fully recovers after second heart surgery, tells press he ‘HOPES MR. TINDALL EMBRACES THE LIGHT’. 1/05/98.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I selected the second link with the name &lt;em&gt;Gregory J. Tindall&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After another uncomfortable minute of Connie squinting over my shoulder, the article loaded on the screen. I’d barely finished the third paragraph when a headshot of Huck Hughes appeared alongside the article—a delighted, bleach-white smile on his face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was startled when Connie cried out: “Why! That’s Big Huck on the computer!”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You know who he is?” I asked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“I just &lt;em&gt;adore&lt;/em&gt; Big Huck.” Connie clasped her liver-spotted hands together. “I watch his program every Sunday. That man is exactly what this nation needs right now—what with the president acting so horribly in the Oval Office. To think this whole time, the very Whore of Babylon herself was crouched under his desk. I nearly died in my chair when the news broke. That’s when I found Big Huck on the TV. He won me over immediately, just seeing the man preach about purity and powers of the Light On High. I’ll tell you right now, young man, I thought I had my way to the afterlife figured out until Big Huck came along. ‘The Light will lift you’, he says. ‘You have to be pure enough to float, if the Light chooses you.’”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Wait, wait. Do you know about the shooting?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“How could I forget? That dreadful man shot poor ol’ Big Huck square in the chest. Raving and spouting nonsense. You know what, I heard on good authority that he was secretly worshipping the devil. But even the devil couldn’t stop Big Huck! He’s a strong man… very strong.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“What happened to the shooter? Tindall? Where’s he?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Connie gave me a satisfied smirk. “He’s where the Light doesn’t shine. If attempted murder isn’t enough to end up in Hell, then suicide is. They found him hanging in his cell. Mind you, this was all the talk at the time—” she paused, looking at me with realization. “I’ll be! Red, you’ve been watching his program, haven’t you! Such a wonderful thing to hear. Just what someone like you needs. I should’ve guessed it—watching you come home every day without a lick of booze on you.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ve been &lt;em&gt;spying&lt;/em&gt; on me?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh, of course I have. But now you’re on your way to the Light On High! I’m so very proud of you—here, here, do you need some tea?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Connie was in such a fit of joy I was a little nervous she’d keel over from a heart attack. I accepted the offer just to get some time alone. I skimmed all three articles and was disappointed with each—except finding out that Gregory Tindall had driven to Idaho from northern Nebraska. That was definitely something. Before I left, I asked Connie if she’d experienced any miracles watching Big Huck on TV. She rambled about hip pains, headaches, blurry spots in her vision, her heart and so on—often contradicting herself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I had a few sips of jasmine tea with Connie, then escaped further conversation with a lie about an oil change.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, On High Ministry had moved to Idaho and, apparently, they had dragged along undesirable baggage—Gregory Tindall, in this case—with them. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sank into my chair downstairs and mulled everything over—nothing close to a revelation coming to me. Four hours before Big Huck would broadcast. I couldn’t stand to just sit in my apartment and wait.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’d gotten ten feet out the door when I stumbled a step. A pulse in my right leg. Then a second and a third.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There wasn’t the agonizing throb I’d been subjected to last Sunday—just an uncomfortable echo of that pain. I stood bent over, my hands pressed to my leg, hoping the sensation would pass. I was afraid. Stunned. Like I’d been caught in the jaws of an invisible spring-trap, my leg the thing that held me fast. When the sensation finally vanished, I straightened and wiped the sweat from my forehead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tested my leg as I continued walking, finding nothing wrong with it even as I climbed into my pickup. With my hands on the steering wheel, I sat there for a while and tried thinking of an explanation for all of this. This shouldn’t be possible. And I shouldn&amp;#39;t have any reason to fear a two-bit televangelist on TV. Behind the window blinds upstairs, I caught Connie peeking down at me through a narrow slat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For an hour I just drove along the road, filling time. I passed through a few neighborhoods, rolled through downtown, and even the back roads. I just followed the yellow lines on the pavement.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It’s pathetic to admit, but half a decade with a bum leg gave me a reason to be who I was. It justified the resentment, hate, guilt and my constant drinking in the first place. Without it, I didn’t know what was really left of me. For the time being, at least, I could focus all my unease and frustration on the cause of my healing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I slammed the brakes. The full weight of my truck lurched to a stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A woman leaped back from my pickup, shouting at me. She looked younger than I was, with large glasses and her sandy hair clumped in a bun. A denim jacket hung baggy on her. There was a bright orange tattoo on the side of her neck—flowers, maybe. A chunky camcorder slung on a strap over her shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She flipped me the bird and finished crossing the street. I let my heart settle again, then carried on my way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, I made a decision—shitfaced it is. I rolled up to the only bar open on Sunday, sat alone on a bar stool, slapped money on the counter and worked my way down a bottle of Jameson. It hit me hard and it hit me good. Thankfully the bar owner, Buddy, had the decency to kick me out the door after I admitted that I’d pissed all over the urinal. I was swerving a little on the drive home, here and there, and accidentally flattened a squirrel. Felt bad about that. Stumbling out of my pickup, I tried my best to appear sober as I walked to my apartment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The fear was creeping over me again. I’d hoped a sufficient dunk in liquor might have solved that, but far from it. 6 PM was inevitably drawing near.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5:45… 5:55…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I staggered over to the fridge and snatched a beer. Chugged it and then helped myself to another, just to be safe. Holding the remote in my hand, I tried to think of all the alternatives to watching the Sunday program. I could simply &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do it. I could just go to bed and escape this unpleasant dream I’d found myself stuck in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Click.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A title card was on the screen: &lt;em&gt;Way of the Light On High, with Huck Hughes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a minute of band music, the title card faded to a viewing of the same stage as last week. Big Huck stood attired in his pearly-white suit. He flashed a smile at the TV. My head was spinning, blurring his large face and smearing it from side to side on the television screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s a delight to have you join us again,” he began. “But before we begin this evening, I have some special news for all of you. Something real special that’s been on my heart for some time now. &lt;em&gt;Yessir&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Big Huck struck a pose of profound contemplation, hands on his podium.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been living here in the Gem State for a handful of years now—a plain wonderful time shared with you. You’ve all seen my face. Heard me preach and watched me labor tirelessly to grow the Light’s influence. Shed this world of its filth, of distaste. Yessir. &lt;em&gt;Yessir&lt;/em&gt;. But finding myself blessed to inhabit such an auspicious role of leader, a herald of the Light On High and things unseen… it can sure leave a big-hearted man like myself feeling a sense of lack. An empty grasp. So! My wife Julee and I are overjoyed to announce that we’re hosting a three day event. &lt;em&gt;Big Huck’s Big Tent&lt;/em&gt;. Yessir! Praise be! Fellowship and transformations! Healing and wonders! I, a humble servant of the Light On High, will finally have the pleasures of looking upon each and every one of your faces. How I crave it.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My stomach churned at the thought—or maybe it was just the liquor sloshing inside of me. I felt sick. Acid burned the back of my throat. I slid off my chair and sat on the floor. I wish I hadn’t drank, not now. My mind reached for anything to hold onto but came up empty. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On High Ministry. The old flyer. Nebraska. Gregory Tindall. Big Huck shot. The Light On High. Miracles. My leg. My leg. My piece of shit gimp leg, fixed through a television. Big Huck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was still blathering away on the TV, most of it slipping past my comprehension. I made myself listen.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“The Light On High will not wait long, I assure you. Yessir. I will see you all in Ponderay.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ponderay.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I vomited on the carpet.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "Hey all, had some things floating in my head recently and just felt like putting them down to share and have some peer review. I saw we have some new players on their first adventures through Lordran here, so I figured I'd spoiler this just in case.\n\nAnyway, my theory is that Sen is Seath. Whether by pseudonym or simply name corruption over time I think there are a few things that connect the fortress to Seath better than any other. Obviously I can't say that Seath is 100% responsible for the fortress, but since we have no information about Sen at all I thought it would be a fun little thing to delve back into.\n\n\n\nFirstly let's look at the guards. The Man-Serpents appear only here in the Fortress, and at the Archives, both times acting as guards, both times for the forces of Anor Londo. Worth noting that in both appearances they also act as jailers - first for Logan, then for our Undead.\n\nWe know that Seath has forces that operate outside of Anor Londo as his Channelers are known to abduct maidens and bring them back to his Archive for experimentation. This would be made significantly easier if he also happened to control the forces that maintained the entrance and exit of the city, ensuring that no one would be aware of his less than savory practices.\n\nWe also know that Seath has a habit of uh...transmogrifying people? He turns maidens into the pisaca, and he is responsible for the creation of moonlight butterflies, possibly the crystal golems as well. I find it likely that he has a hand in the origins of the Man-Serpents specifically to employ as soldiers.\n\nSpeaking of crystal golems, let's talk about golems in general. Seath experiments quite a lot with crystals. Seath likes to abduct people. Crystal golems are known for capturing/containing NPCs (and items!) throughout Lordran. We know that Seath has a presence in Darkroot via the moonlight butterfly, and if we make the, in my opinion, reasonable assumption that he's responsible for these crystal golems we can expand that presence. There in Darkroot we find the golems capturing yet another maiden - Dusk, likely with the intention of bringing her back to Seath for totally reasonable and kindhearted endeavors with no malice whatsoever.\n\nBut I said golems 'in general', didn't I? That's because these crystal golems are not the only golems in Darkroot - we have the ancient soldiers as well, animated by magic and made of inorganic material. Golems. So we have Seath here with his golems and his butterfly, but for what purpose? \n\n  \nHere is where I begin making some bigger assumptions, so take please keep in mind that I am not providing this as evidence for my case, but rather as a conclusion I've drawn from context clues and is part of my theory.\n\nI believe that Seath originally dispatched his forces to Darkroot in order to study the ancient golem magic Oolacile used to animate its tone soldiers, eventually applying it to his crystal golems.\n\nAs obsessed with magic and immortality as Seath is I believe he would have an interest in this. Perhaps a way to place a soul into an inorganic body as means of immortality? Alas, it seems these beings have no personality or sentience of their own, merely moving as commanded. Not a good fit for Seath. So he sends his golems in to study some more, checking different sections of Darkroot. Lucky for him, Princess Dusk ends up crossing time and ends up in the wrong place at the right time. It would be far more useful to be able to take an Oolacile resident for his research - but the problem would be her world disconnecting from his once she's free of the golem, which seems to have the strange ability to cut its contents off from the regular passage of time based on its ability to indefinitely hold Dusk, who disappears only moments after being freed.\n\n  \nNow, that's a lot of conjecture, but we're not done talking about golems, so let's get back to facts. We have another golem in the game, a very famous one. The Iron Golem, located at the top of Sen's Fortress. His presence here does not in itself lend credibility to this theory - he has no stated connection to Seath. Seath is, however, one of two parties associated with golems, and I do not believe that Oolacile would be responsible for the construction of such an entity as it runs antithetical to what we see of their society. I would like to return to this golem later, as he is part of my theory rather than being evidence for it.\n\n  \nWe have a few more golems to cover - the Belfry Gargoyles. Placed to guard the Bell of Awakening, and also guards of Anor Londo. One has to wonder about their placement, and I'd like to talk about it more, but separately as it will be conclusion drawing rather than fact stating. What we know for now is that in both instances they are very close to the gods - the Undead Parish is just outside the walls of Anor Londo, after all. Convienently close to Seath's Channelers in both cases as well, I might add.\n\nMoreover, these creatures seem more chimeric in nature than the other golems. This does not necessarily point to Seath, but he does have a penchant for 'transformation'.\n\n\n\nOne final golem to look at - Dragonslayer Ornstein. Now, I'm aware there's some debate as to the nature of Ornstein in this game. Original intention or retcon though, it has been made objectively clear that this is NOT the real Ornstein. It could be a pretender, but I don't think so.\n\nBy the time of writing this there is now a theme of Ornstein's armor being puppeted or animated, an empty shell fighting against us. I think that starts here. The armor itself is animated and able to fight, which may be why it is able to be corrupted and puppeted by the Dark in DS2 - but that's for later.\n\nThe point here is that the trend of Ornstein's empty armor being a foe and Smough's disregard for Ornstein when he falls, along with our confirmation of Ornstein very much not bring in Anor Londo indicates to me that this may likely be another case of empty metal moving via magic. A golem.\n\n\n\nNow let me put together why I yapped on about golems so much. \n\nSeath is obsessed with magic amd immortality. Whether his interest is in golem making for Gwyn and his forces, or an alternative immortality via soul-swapping to a new vessel, he has learned how to make golems in some form or another. Crystal magic seems to be the most advanced, so I suspect his golem progression started with stone, moved to metal, then finally to crystal. In each case hos creations are put to use for Anor Londo. Two gargoyles within the walls to bolster Gwyn's armies, and two overseeing the city outside the walls, an advance guard should invaders come knocking...or rebellion need suppressing. Constant watchers for the gods. Next, he moves to metal. The masterwork is placed atop Sen's Fortress, a final vanguard - and later test - to those seeking forceful entry to the city of the gods. Finally, much later on, likely after Gwyn has departed to the Kiln, Seath conpletes his crystal golems. Still, they are not quite good enough, so he sends them out to collect more information, more specimens for his research. This is why we find them in Darkroot, home to the origin of golem creation in Lordran. They capture Dusk, but are either unable to make the return or simply unable to release her for enough time to be useful, and therefore remain in Darkroot. Of course, they may also be there to guard the man in the tower, but that's another topic, though I'd be remiss not to acknowledge appropriate rebuttals.\n\nNow these first moves with his stone golems allow Seath eyes on the outside, ways to exert his influence and keep an eye out. With his metal golem he secures control of the Fortress itself, assisted by the presence of his Man-Serpents acting as guards throughout its corridors. These creatures may be a later addition however - the presence of Silver Knights is at least implied at some point, and perhaps they were expected to man its walls. Now they only have mere statues, a facade to hide the true nature of its guards. \n\nRegardless, Seath would have full control of this fortress and its comings and goings, the only forces still following Geyn's orders bring the giant slaves when they hear the bells chime - something Seath may have considered impossible with his defensive measures. This means he is free to move his own units in and out of the Fortress at his leisure, with none being the wiser.\n\n  \nI have more to go into this but uh...I fear I may have become a bit long-winded here. So if I'm not laughed out of here for being stupidly wrong and incredibly late to the party on Dark Souls fucking ONE lore talk, well, I'll probably make a separate (shorter?) post to add on. I would also like to discuss mimics, but I saw some interesting info about them and the original Japanese text tonight that I'd like to ponder, but if nothing else we can call it a competing theory you can use to bash my head in later.\n\n  \nFinal note, as I suspect it may be brought up. Some of you may point out that Ornstein and the gargoyles bleed when you hit them (or liberate them from their tail). To this I would like to say that I did some checking. Iron Golem, Old Dragonslayer, and Dragonslayer Armour are all confirmed to be non-living creatures, inorganic material animated by magic. They ALL bleed when hit. This either means we have to treat it as purely a visual cue for gameplay purposes, or that some aspect of the magic woven into them causes this. Didn't see it with the crystal golems though, so there is that. Anyway, thanks for reading all this nonsense.

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all, had some things floating in my head recently and just felt like putting them down to share and have some peer review. I saw we have some new players on their first adventures through Lordran here, so I figured I&amp;#39;d spoiler this just in case.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, my theory is that Sen is Seath. Whether by pseudonym or simply name corruption over time I think there are a few things that connect the fortress to Seath better than any other. Obviously I can&amp;#39;t say that Seath is 100% responsible for the fortress, but since we have no information about Sen at all I thought it would be a fun little thing to delve back into.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Firstly let&amp;#39;s look at the guards. The Man-Serpents appear only here in the Fortress, and at the Archives, both times acting as guards, both times for the forces of Anor Londo. Worth noting that in both appearances they also act as jailers - first for Logan, then for our Undead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We know that Seath has forces that operate outside of Anor Londo as his Channelers are known to abduct maidens and bring them back to his Archive for experimentation. This would be made significantly easier if he also happened to control the forces that maintained the entrance and exit of the city, ensuring that no one would be aware of his less than savory practices.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We also know that Seath has a habit of uh...transmogrifying people? He turns maidens into the pisaca, and he is responsible for the creation of moonlight butterflies, possibly the crystal golems as well. I find it likely that he has a hand in the origins of the Man-Serpents specifically to employ as soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of crystal golems, let&amp;#39;s talk about golems in general. Seath experiments quite a lot with crystals. Seath likes to abduct people. Crystal golems are known for capturing/containing NPCs (and items!) throughout Lordran. We know that Seath has a presence in Darkroot via the moonlight butterfly, and if we make the, in my opinion, reasonable assumption that he&amp;#39;s responsible for these crystal golems we can expand that presence. There in Darkroot we find the golems capturing yet another maiden - Dusk, likely with the intention of bringing her back to Seath for totally reasonable and kindhearted endeavors with no malice whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But I said golems &amp;#39;in general&amp;#39;, didn&amp;#39;t I? That&amp;#39;s because these crystal golems are not the only golems in Darkroot - we have the ancient soldiers as well, animated by magic and made of inorganic material. Golems. So we have Seath here with his golems and his butterfly, but for what purpose? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here is where I begin making some bigger assumptions, so take please keep in mind that I am not providing this as evidence for my case, but rather as a conclusion I&amp;#39;ve drawn from context clues and is part of my theory.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I believe that Seath originally dispatched his forces to Darkroot in order to study the ancient golem magic Oolacile used to animate its tone soldiers, eventually applying it to his crystal golems.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As obsessed with magic and immortality as Seath is I believe he would have an interest in this.

          "selftext": "# Personal Information\n\n**True Name:** ???/Dante\n\n**Aliases:** Dante, Executive Manager of the LCB, Sinner #10, Manager Esquire, Manager Bud, Clockhead, C.F., Commander Clock, Tick-Tock.\n\n**Source:** Limbus Company\n\n**Class:** Ruler\n\n**Alternate Classes:** Beast, Savior, Gatekeeper\n\n**Gender:** ???\n\n**Alignment:** Neutral Good\n\n**Hidden Attribute:** Star\n\n# Parameters\n\n**Strength:** E\n\n**Endurance:** C\n\n**Agility:** E\n\n**Mana:** EX\n\n**Luck:** A\n\n**Noble Phantasm:** EX\n\n# Class Skills\n\n**Magic Resistance:** D\n\n**True Name Discernment:** B\n\n**Independent Action:** EX\n\nThe Golden Bough stored within Dante serves as an abundant source of energy, allowing for manifestation and full utilization of all abilities without the need for a Master. Unfortunately, the usage of said energy is limited, it may fuel the servant but nothing else can be done with it. Even before becoming a Servant, Dante never had a need for eating or drinking, being unable to perform those actions since their head was exchanged for the Prosthesis.\n\n# Personal Skills\n\n**I Am Their Manager: C+**\n\nCharisma-type Skill. As the Manager, it's their job to lead the Sinners in their journey… which is not easy, considering the mental predisposition of said Sinners, but nevertheless, bonds have been formed and Dante themselves sees the Sinners as trusted companions. Although amateurish, the Manager steps up to the challenge when push comes to shove, helping the Sinners to become a better version of themselves.\n\n**Golden Bough Resonance: B**\n\nDante is able to sense where the Golden Boughs are by resonating with them and perceiving their location by \"following their star\". As a Servant, this allows not only for the detection of Golden Boughs, but also of other sources of Magical Energy, similar to Presence Detection.\n\n**Telepathy: D**\n\nDante can only communicate through a ticking sound, which they can alter the frequency and intensity of. Only the Sinners and a few others can understand the intended speech behind the ticks. Additionally it allows Dante to understand the intended speech of beings who do not communicate through a ‘Language of Words’, including those affected by Madness Enhancement and Mental Pollution, Abnormalities and Distortions. \n\n**Overseer of the Battlefield: D\\~A++**\n\nAs the Manager, it is their job to analyze the battlefield and give orders to the Sinners accordingly. At the beginning of a battle only basic information is available, but as it continues more information is gained and better strategies are formed, bypassing even information concealment abilities. The information is retained after battle and can be utilized at full potential when fighting enemies already analyzed.\n\n**Clockhead Prosthesis: EX**\n\nDante cannot remember anything from before gaining their head prosthesis, the only thing that remains is the desire to “Engrave the Aspect”, although they themselves have no idea what that means. As “one without identity”, any other person who tries to discover Dante’s true self, either by mystical or mundane means, will hopelessly fail. Additionally, Dante has resistance to all forms of Mental Interference and immunity to Memory Manipulation.\n\n**Doomsday Clock: ???**\n\nWhen the clock strikes midnight ■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■.\n\n# Noble Phantasm\n\n**La Divina Commedia - The Journey of Twelve Through the Three Realms and 32 Paths: EX**\n\nThe 12 Sinners are tied by the chains of fate and contract, wherever the Manager goes the others will follow. In a scenario where Dante is the only Sinner summoned, the other 11 will unquestionably manifest as Sub-Servants. Similarly to the Pioneer of the Stars Skill, It allows one to overcome impossibilities met in their journey.\n\n\n\n**Dante’s Notes - Limbus Company Managerial Interface: A**\n\nDante’s PDA is both a diary for recordkeeping and a tool to assist them in combat. With it being directly linked to the Golden Bough in Dante’s head, and thus their senses, it helps to streamline combat decisions for the Manager. Through it, Dante is capable of bringing forth Identities of Mirror Worlds and synchronizing them with the Sinners so that they may gain the Parameters, Skills and possible Noble Phantasms of their alternate selves. It also allows the Sinners to use their own E.G.O, which are stabilized enough to avoid distortion, or Abnormality E.G.Os, which carry the risk of corrosion if used too often. Without **Mephistopheles - The Reality Refraction Engine,** however, it is not possible to extract new Identities or E.G.O and only those acquired before Dante is summoned can be used.\n\n\n\n**Turn Back the Clock - Opening the Gates of Lament: EX**\n\nRegardless of damage sustained or cause of death, so long as Dante is willing to bear the pain(sins) of their Sinners, they can be revived as many times as necessary.\n\n\n\n**Durante - Sapling of Light: A\\~EX**\n\n■■■■■■■■■■■■ ■■ ■ ■■■■ ■■ ■■■■■ ■■■■■■■ ■■■ ■■■■■ ■■ ■■■ ■■■■■. ■■■ ■■ ■■■ ■■■ ■■■■ ■■ ■■ ■■■■■■■■. Manifests different effects for each ■■■■■■■. Due to the strain using these abilities causes the Manager, they were limited to using them only twice per day, now as a Servant, this limit may be circumvented.\n\n\n\n**Pigritia - Hokma, The Wisdom:** Creates a Bounded Field centered on Dante that decelerates time for all but the Sinners in a certain radius. *&lt;Embrace the Past, Build the Future.&gt;*\n\n\n\n**Suburbia - Binah, The Understanding:** Forcibly activates an E.G.O or Noble Phantasm regardless of circumstances or restrictions. *&lt;Face the Fear, Break the Cycle.&gt;*\n\n\n\n**Morositas - Chesed, The Love:** Temporarily averages the Parameters of all selected targets. *&lt;Under mercy, all shall be made equal.&gt;*\n\n\n\n**Ira - Geburah, The Strength:** Strengthens all abilities of a Sinner to their utmost limit for a single instant of offence, their next attack is unavoidable and the Sinner cannot be killed during it. *&lt;Melt down the severed chain and reforge it in the roaring kiln of one’s heart.&gt;*\n\n\n\n**M@!L%#TH, T%# K!NG#DO@:** Unstable. Allows Dante to remotely command and communicate with every Sinner, as well as manifest “Shadow Servant” Sinners that lack independent will. *&lt;Return to me, stand with me here... stand tall... &gt;*\n\n\n\n**Meltdown Star - The Last Resort: EX**\n\nA preventative measure to stop the Golden Boughs from falling into wrong hands. By inputting a sequence into a button on the back of their head, Dante can self-detonate a charge within their clock which, although lacking range, possesses enough heat 'to melt even the Stars of the City'.\n\n# Dialogue\n\n**Temporary Summoning:**\n\n&lt;Hello, I am Dante, Manager of the Limbus Company Bus Department. This isn’t actually our first time ending up in a different world… Well, until we find a way back I’d like to help where I can.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Summoning:**\n\n&lt;So it seems we’ll stay here for a bit longer. According to Faust, helping you won’t interfere with our own journey, so I don’t see any reason to refuse. It’s… refreshing to see so many things that are not The City. Regardless, I look forward to working with you. Umm, s-should I call you Mas- o-oh, ‘just Ritsuka is fine’ you say? Okay then.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 1:**\n\n&lt;Oh, are we heading out? Alright then, I’ll gather the Sinners and see what Identities will work best.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 2:**\n\n&lt;This place is really different from what I’m used to. Just earlier today I learned what a ‘country’ is, I still don’t really understand how so many different Cities can exist. Huh? What do you mean ‘a city is something entirely different’?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 3:**\n\n&lt;’Master and Servant’... it’s quite different from the relationship I have with the Sinners, but also not really? Well, since we’re the outsiders we’ll fight under your command. Outis will probably complain though.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 4 (If you have Inventor Servants):**\n\n&lt;It’s nice to see Faust and Yi Sang have company. Apparently, the technology in the City is very different from what you have here. Things got… heated when a few Singularities were mentioned, and apparently the Mirror is something very absurd too? Honestly, I couldn’t keep up with the conversation.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 5 (If you have Kitchen Staff Servants):**\n\n&lt;I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone so distraught at my inability to eat. I mean… I don’t feel any hunger, and I don’t remember ever eating so it’s not like I can ‘miss’ eating. I really don’t see the problem, Rodya is sure to eat for five people anyway.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 6 (If you have Dead Apostle Servants):**\n\n&lt;So Bloodfiends are a thing in this world too?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 7 (If you have Swordsman Servants):**\n\n&lt;R-Ryoshu, you have a scary glint in your eyes. Go have your fun, but everything in moderation… please?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 8 (If you have Abnormality Servants):**\n\n&lt;O-oh, he-hello there… it seems they don’t remember me at all? I guess they aren’t the same as in the Mirror Dungeons or Refraction Railways…&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 9 (If you have Mash Kyrielight, Sieg, Irisviel or Yui Shōsetsu):**\n\n&lt;It seems there are a few Servants Faust is adamant in avoiding… Her turn hasn’t come yet and I’d like to help where I can, but she keeps shutting me down when I bring it up...&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 10 (If you have a Knight of the Round Table):**\n\n&lt;W-wait, hold on Don Quixote! I know you’re excited but it’s disrespectful to- o-oh, it’s fine? Well, I wouldn’t mind hearing a few legends from this world either.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 11 (If you have Servants who use guns):**\n\n&lt;W-wow, cultural difference sure is a thing, huh?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 12 (If you have Divine Spirits):**\n\n&lt;The Stars… A-ah, sorry, what were we talking about again?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 13 (If you have a Beast-class Servant):**\n\n&lt;...&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 14 (If you have Marie Antoinette):**\n\n&lt;It’s nice to see Meursault interact more with other people, even if he isn't the one initiating it. He can be a bit intense sometimes, but the queen’s extrovert nature seems to cut right through anyway. She’s been very nice to me too, seemed flabbergasted that I didn’t know what France was and gave me quite the lecture. I’ve never expected a queen to speak so casually, but if I were to compare her to the CEOs I know, the eccentricity is the same.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 15 (If you have Edmond Dantès):**\n\n&lt;He approached us at first because of my name, apparently. But turns out he got along quite well with Heathcliff… at least I think he did, in his own way?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 16 (If you have Angra Mainyu):**\n\n&lt;He’s a pretty lively one. Calls me ‘a partner in bearing Sin’... I think I understand the implications, but I have a feeling it’s deeper than I understand.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 17 (If you have Mephistopheles):**\n\n&lt;F-faust, let’s be reasonable here, put the sword dow- Meursault help!&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 18 (If you have Artoria Pendragon \\[Lancer Alter\\]):**\n\n&lt;You are-!... Not who I thought you were? S-sorry, you just reminded me of someone else.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 19 (If you have PHH Ahab):**\n\n&lt;Ishmael, you know as well as I do that it’s not the same person, right? C’mon, let’s go somewhere else. You won’t forgive yourself if you use that Harpoon.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 20 (If you have Miyamoto Iori):**\n\n&lt;Ah, you’re also missing memories? It’s nice to have someone who also- I m-mean not that I think you not having your memories is a good thing, s-surely it would be better if- huh? ‘No problem, I get what you mean’? Right, sorry… Say, are you not… afraid… of the person you were before? What if the two ‘yous’ just can’t accept one another? ‘Regardless of what happens, I know I’ll have Saber by my side to knock sense into me’? Haha, yeah, you’re right, and I’ll have the Sinners by my side. Thank you.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 21 (If you have First Hassan):**\n\n&lt;Sometimes I see him staring at me, almost in contemplation. I don’t think he likes me very much.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 22 (If you have Ishtar Ashtart ):**\n\n&lt;Your Stars, they are so… Ah-, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to stare.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 23 (If you have PHH Don Quixote):**\n\n&lt;It’s actually pretty amusing seeing the two Don Quixotes talking to each other. Our Don makes some pretty interesting expressions, something between excitement and cringing. Your Roscinante seem pretty adamant in dotting our Don too.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 24 (If you have Gilgamesh \\[Archer\\]):**\n\n&lt;He just stared at me, laughed and kept walking like I wasn't even there… I really don’t know what to make of it.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 25 (If you have Gilgamesh \\[Caster\\]):**\n\n&lt;’Keep on your journey and one day you may reach the Star you long for. However, be sure its light does not blind you, strugler’, he said… I don’t know what to make of it.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 26 (If you have Kid Gil):**\n\n&lt;’Ahaha, you sure have something pretty interesting there. Is it the dawn of a new age or the end of everything, I wonder?’... I really don’t know what to make of it, and Faust refuses to answer me anything. I don’t know how to deal with any version of that Golden King.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 27 (If you have Dante Alighieri):**\n\n&lt;Huh? Was someone here just now? S-sorry I can’t seem to… Alighieri you say? That name, I-I… Ack, sorry, my head is hurting all of a sudden. I really don’t… Sorry, let me rest for a bit.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 28 (If you have Yang Guifei):**\n\n&lt;ACK! What the- what sort of Star even is that!? Huh? N-no, I mean… goodbye!&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 29 (If you have Odysseus):**\n\n&lt;Nope, I can’t see it. I know that there’s a few Servants of this world that are like the Sinners, but… the difference is just too much here.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 30 (If you have LC Vergillius):**\n\n&lt;Vergillius, so you’re here too! ‘What kind of Guide would I be if I just let you off on your own’? Well, I guess it makes sense… hold on you can hear me now!?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 31 (If you have LC Charon):**\n\n&lt;Hi Charon, it’s wonderful to see you again. And now that the bus is also here, we can Extract again… Huh? What’s a ‘pseudo-servant’? YOU’RE A GOD!?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 32 (If you have LC Hermann):**\n\n&lt;I cannot accept you, and I will not let Gregor become you plaything again. He is my Sinner and I am his Manager, whatever you plan on doing, it won’t work. I’ll make sure of it.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 33 (If you have LC Sonya):**\n\n&lt;I don’t know what to make of you. You obviously know more about life in the City than I do, so you have more right than me to change it… but you’re also working with our enemies, even if I don’t disagree with the actions of Yurodiviye, we’ll still come to blows anyway…&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 34 (If you have LC Krommer):**\n\n&lt;We couldn’t defeat you back in Calw, but we aren’t the same as back then. Try your worst, we will overcome it.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 35 (If you have Dongrang or Dongbaek):**\n\n&lt;I know we were enemies in the past, but I honestly could never bring myself to dislike you. Since we’re on the same side here, why not try to get along? Surely, you also wish to see Yi Sang’s wings in full, don’t you?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 36 (If you have LC Ahab):**\n\n&lt;You lost, Ahab, and you can’t make things back to how they were before, either. There’s no longer a Whale for you to hunt, so why do you still… no, it doesn’t matter, Ishmael chose to tie her boat to ours, she chose to go on her own journey alongside us, as her compass I will never abandon her. Stay out of her way, Ahab, there’s no meaning to us fighting here.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 37 (If you have Erlking Heathcliff):**\n\n&lt;Was the Mirror not enough? You would travel even to a completely different World for your quest? I won’t let you harm our Heathcliff, not matter what kind of ‘justification’ you have.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 38 (If you have LC Nelly):**\n\n&lt;Why did you do it? Back then, if you hadn’t burnt those letters then maybe… No, you made your choice, and there’s nothing we can do to change it. I don’t hate you, but whether we are enemies or not, is something for Heathcliff to decide.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 39 (If you have La Manchaland's Don Quixote):**\n\n&lt;I’m sorry. After everything I just sat there and let you be… you forgive me? But I- … you really are a great person. C’mon, Don- I mean, Sancho will thrilled to see you.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 40 (If you have Jia Mu):**\n\n&lt;I don’t care if we are technical allies right now, don’t come close to Hong Lu.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 41 (If you have a Nursefather of the House of Spiders):**\n\n&lt;They all expressed their… affection for Ryoshu in different ways, but in the end, they always saw her as a tool for their own convenience. I doubt we will get along, but I’ll try to stop them from killing each other.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 42 (If you have LC Araya):**\n\n&lt;She still doesn’t remember, but the thread is still there and we will weave back whole again. Don’t worry, Araya, she will remember.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 43 (If you have LC Moses):**\n\n&lt;With everything that was happening back at HQ we couldn’t really talk, but… if possible, could you explain to me how you go about resolving Distortions?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 44 (If you have AK Doctor):**\n\n&lt;Doctor, thank you for your help back in Iberia. We didn’t talk much back then, due to the circumstances, but I hope we’ll get along from here on out. Being able to hear me properly definitely helps, doesn’t it? How are Amiya and Miss Kal'tsit doing? H-huh? W-wait, what’s wrong?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 45 (If you have Mayors):**\n\n&lt;Mayors, you may not be my Sinner but that doesn’t mean I can't help you on your journey. I’m sure you will find the answers you seek, and don’t be too shy to ask for our help along the way, even if you’re not a Sinner, you are one of us, i-if that makes any sense.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 46 (If you have Head Librarian or Sefirot Servants):**\n\n&lt;Huh, does Walpurgisnacht also happen here? WHAT DO YOU MEAN THESE ARE THE REAL ONES!?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 47 (If you have LoR Angela):**\n\n&lt;She keeps looking at me, then averting her eyes… I-I, h-have I done something wrong?&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 48 (If you have A Certain Sinclair):**\n\n&lt;I won’t let it happen, no matter what. I promise.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 49 (If you have Carmen):**\n\n&lt;I see… I’m glad I can finally meet you properly.  Hello, Miss Carmen, we have much to talk about.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Dialogue 50 (If you have Demian):**\n\n&lt;I… haven’t drawn your sheep yet. I will, be sure of it.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Something you Like:**\n\n&lt;Seeing new things. I only have a year’s worth of memories and they are basically all from within the City. There's still a bunch of different things I don’t quite understand either, so it’s nice to learn more about the world… unfortunately most new things to discover in the City… are not to be celebrated.&gt;\n\n\n\n**Something you Hate:**\n\n&lt;...Rewinding the Clock. It’s my duty as the Manager, and I’ll never hesitate to do it… but the pain is just not something I can ever get used to.&gt;\n\n\n\n**About the Holy Grail:**\n\n&lt;I don’t really understand the details, but it’s like a Golden Bough, right? …If I had to wish for something… I’d like to know who I used to be… even if that thought can be a bit scary.&gt;\n\n\n\n**During an Event:**\n\n&lt;A festival? I’ve never been to one before. Let me go get the others, I’m sure they will love it!&gt;\n\n\n\n**Birthday:**\n\n&lt;B-birthday!? Shucks, why did no one tell me sooner!? I didn’t prepare anything! No it’s not ‘fine’, something like that is really important y’know!?&gt;",

Unfortunately, the usage of said energy is limited, it may fuel the servant but nothing else can be done with it. Even before becoming a Servant, Dante never had a need for eating or drinking, being unable to perform those actions since their head was exchanged for the Prosthesis.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Personal Skills&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I Am Their Manager: C+&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Charisma-type Skill. As the Manager, it&amp;#39;s their job to lead the Sinners in their journey… which is not easy, considering the mental predisposition of said Sinners, but nevertheless, bonds have been formed and Dante themselves sees the Sinners as trusted companions. Although amateurish, the Manager steps up to the challenge when push comes to shove, helping the Sinners to become a better version of themselves.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Golden Bough Resonance: B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dante is able to sense where the Golden Boughs are by resonating with them and perceiving their location by &amp;quot;following their star&amp;quot;. As a Servant, this allows not only for the detection of Golden Boughs, but also of other sources of Magical Energy, similar to Presence Detection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telepathy: D&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dante can only communicate through a ticking sound, which they can alter the frequency and intensity of. Only the Sinners and a few others can understand the intended speech behind the ticks. Additionally it allows Dante to understand the intended speech of beings who do not communicate through a ‘Language of Words’, including those affected by Madness Enhancement and Mental Pollution, Abnormalities and Distortions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overseer of the Battlefield: D~A++&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As the Manager, it is their job to analyze the battlefield and give orders to the Sinners accordingly. At the beginning of a battle only basic information is available, but as it continues more information is gained and better strategies are formed, bypassing even information concealment abilities. The information is retained after battle and can be utilized at full potential when fighting enemies already analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clockhead Prosthesis: EX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dante cannot remember anything from before gaining their head prosthesis, the only thing that remains is the desire to “Engrave the Aspect”, although they themselves have no idea what that means. As “one without identity”, any other person who tries to discover Dante’s true self, either by mystical or mundane means, will hopelessly fail. Additionally, Dante has resistance to all forms of Mental Interference and immunity to Memory Manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doomsday Clock: ???&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When the clock strikes midnight ■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■■■ ■■■.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Noble Phantasm&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;La Divina Commedia - The Journey of Twelve Through the Three Realms and 32 Paths: EX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The 12 Sinners are tied by the chains of fate and contract, wherever the Manager goes the others will follow. In a scenario where Dante is the only Sinner summoned, the other 11 will unquestionably manifest as Sub-Servants. Similarly to the Pioneer of the Stars Skill, It allows one to overcome impossibilities met in their journey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dante’s Notes - Limbus Company Managerial Interface: A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dante’s PDA is both a diary for recordkeeping and a tool to assist them in combat. With it being directly linked to the Golden Bough in Dante’s head, and thus their senses, it helps to streamline combat decisions for the Manager. Through it, Dante is capable of bringing forth Identities of Mirror Worlds and synchronizing them with the Sinners so that they may gain the Parameters, Skills and possible Noble Phantasms of their alternate selves. It also allows the Sinners to use their own E.G.O, which are stabilized enough to avoid distortion, or Abnormality E.G.Os, which carry the risk of corrosion if used too often. Without &lt;strong&gt;Mephistopheles - The Reality Refraction Engine,&lt;/strong&gt; however, it is not possible to extract new Identities or E.G.O and only those acquired before Dante is summoned can be used.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn Back the Clock - Opening the Gates of Lament: EX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Regardless of damage sustained or cause of death, so long as Dante is willing to bear the pain(sins) of their Sinners, they can be revived as many times as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durante - Sapling of Light: A~EX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;■■■■■■■■■■■■ ■■ ■ ■■■■ ■■ ■■■■■ ■■■■■■■ ■■■ ■■■■■ ■■ ■■■ ■■■■■. ■■■ ■■ ■■■ ■■■ ■■■■ ■■ ■■ ■■■■■■■■. Manifests different effects for each ■■■■■■■. Due to the strain using these abilities causes the Manager, they were limited to using them only twice per day, now as a Servant, this limit may be circumvented.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pigritia - Hokma, The Wisdom:&lt;/strong&gt; Creates a Bounded Field centered on Dante that decelerates time for all but the Sinners in a certain radius. &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;Embrace the Past, Build the Future.&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suburbia - Binah, The Understanding:&lt;/strong&gt; Forcibly activates an E.G.O or Noble Phantasm regardless of circumstances or restrictions. &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;Face the Fear, Break the Cycle.&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Morositas - Chesed, The Love:&lt;/strong&gt; Temporarily averages the Parameters of all selected targets. &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;Under mercy, all shall be made equal.&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ira - Geburah, The Strength:&lt;/strong&gt; Strengthens all abilities of a Sinner to their utmost limit for a single instant of offence, their next attack is unavoidable and the Sinner cannot be killed during it. &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;Melt down the severed chain and reforge it in the roaring kiln of one’s heart.&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M@!L%#TH, T%# K!NG#DO@:&lt;/strong&gt; Unstable. Allows Dante to remotely command and communicate with every Sinner, as well as manifest “Shadow Servant” Sinners that lack independent will. &lt;em&gt;&amp;lt;Return to me, stand with me here... stand tall... &amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meltdown Star - The Last Resort: EX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A preventative measure to stop the Golden Boughs from falling into wrong hands. By inputting a sequence into a button on the back of their head, Dante can self-detonate a charge within their clock which, although lacking range, possesses enough heat &amp;#39;to melt even the Stars of the City&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Dialogue&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporary Summoning:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Hello, I am Dante, Manager of the Limbus Company Bus Department. This isn’t actually our first time ending up in a different world… Well, until we find a way back I’d like to help where I can.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summoning:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;So it seems we’ll stay here for a bit longer. According to Faust, helping you won’t interfere with our own journey, so I don’t see any reason to refuse. It’s… refreshing to see so many things that are not The City. Regardless, I look forward to working with you. Umm, s-should I call you Mas- o-oh, ‘just Ritsuka is fine’ you say? Okay then.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Oh, are we heading out? Alright then, I’ll gather the Sinners and see what Identities will work best.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;This place is really different from what I’m used to. Just earlier today I learned what a ‘country’ is, I still don’t really understand how so many different Cities can exist. Huh? What do you mean ‘a city is something entirely different’?&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 3:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;’Master and Servant’... it’s quite different from the relationship I have with the Sinners, but also not really? Well, since we’re the outsiders we’ll fight under your command. Outis will probably complain though.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 4 (If you have Inventor Servants):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;It’s nice to see Faust and Yi Sang have company. Apparently, the technology in the City is very different from what you have here. Things got… heated when a few Singularities were mentioned, and apparently the Mirror is something very absurd too? Honestly, I couldn’t keep up with the conversation.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 5 (If you have Kitchen Staff Servants):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone so distraught at my inability to eat. I mean… I don’t feel any hunger, and I don’t remember ever eating so it’s not like I can ‘miss’ eating. I really don’t see the problem, Rodya is sure to eat for five people anyway.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 6 (If you have Dead Apostle Servants):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;So Bloodfiends are a thing in this world too?&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 7 (If you have Swordsman Servants):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;R-Ryoshu, you have a scary glint in your eyes. Go have your fun, but everything in moderation… please?&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 8 (If you have Abnormality Servants):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;O-oh, he-hello there… it seems they don’t remember me at all? I guess they aren’t the same as in the Mirror Dungeons or Refraction Railways…&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 9 (If you have Mash Kyrielight, Sieg, Irisviel or Yui Shōsetsu):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;It seems there are a few Servants Faust is adamant in avoiding… Her turn hasn’t come yet and I’d like to help where I can, but she keeps shutting me down when I bring it up...&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 10 (If you have a Knight of the Round Table):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;W-wait, hold on Don Quixote! I know you’re excited but it’s disrespectful to- o-oh, it’s fine? Well, I wouldn’t mind hearing a few legends from this world either.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 11 (If you have Servants who use guns):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;W-wow, cultural difference sure is a thing, huh?&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 12 (If you have Divine Spirits):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;The Stars… A-ah, sorry, what were we talking about again?&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 13 (If you have a Beast-class Servant):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;...&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 14 (If you have Marie Antoinette):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;It’s nice to see Meursault interact more with other people, even if he isn&amp;#39;t the one initiating it. He can be a bit intense sometimes, but the queen’s extrovert nature seems to cut right through anyway. She’s been very nice to me too, seemed flabbergasted that I didn’t know what France was and gave me quite the lecture. I’ve never expected a queen to speak so casually, but if I were to compare her to the CEOs I know, the eccentricity is the same.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 15 (If you have Edmond Dantès):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;He approached us at first because of my name, apparently. But turns out he got along quite well with Heathcliff… at least I think he did, in his own way?&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 16 (If you have Angra Mainyu):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;He’s a pretty lively one. Calls me ‘a partner in bearing Sin’... I think I understand the implications, but I have a feeling it’s deeper than I understand.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 17 (If you have Mephistopheles):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;F-faust, let’s be reasonable here, put the sword dow- Meursault help!&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 18 (If you have Artoria Pendragon [Lancer Alter]):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;You are-!... Not who I thought you were? S-sorry, you just reminded me of someone else.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 19 (If you have PHH Ahab):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Ishmael, you know as well as I do that it’s not the same person, right? C’mon, let’s go somewhere else. You won’t forgive yourself if you use that Harpoon.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 20 (If you have Miyamoto Iori):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Ah, you’re also missing memories? It’s nice to have someone who also- I m-mean not that I think you not having your memories is a good thing, s-surely it would be better if- huh? ‘No problem, I get what you mean’? Right, sorry… Say, are you not… afraid… of the person you were before? What if the two ‘yous’ just can’t accept one another? ‘Regardless of what happens, I know I’ll have Saber by my side to knock sense into me’? Haha, yeah, you’re right, and I’ll have the Sinners by my side. Thank you.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 21 (If you have First Hassan):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Sometimes I see him staring at me, almost in contemplation. I don’t think he likes me very much.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 22 (If you have Ishtar Ashtart ):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Your Stars, they are so… Ah-, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to stare.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 23 (If you have PHH Don Quixote):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;It’s actually pretty amusing seeing the two Don Quixotes talking to each other. Our Don makes some pretty interesting expressions, something between excitement and cringing. Your Roscinante seem pretty adamant in dotting our Don too.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 24 (If you have Gilgamesh [Archer]):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;He just stared at me, laughed and kept walking like I wasn&amp;#39;t even there… I really don’t know what to make of it.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 25 (If you have Gilgamesh [Caster]):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;’Keep on your journey and one day you may reach the Star you long for. However, be sure its light does not blind you, strugler’, he said… I don’t know what to make of it.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 26 (If you have Kid Gil):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;’Ahaha, you sure have something pretty interesting there. Is it the dawn of a new age or the end of everything, I wonder?’... I really don’t know what to make of it, and Faust refuses to answer me anything. I don’t know how to deal with any version of that Golden King.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 27 (If you have Dante Alighieri):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Huh? Was someone here just now? S-sorry I can’t seem to… Alighieri you say? That name, I-I… Ack, sorry, my head is hurting all of a sudden. I really don’t… Sorry, let me rest for a bit.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 28 (If you have Yang Guifei):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;ACK! What the- what sort of Star even is that!? Huh? N-no, I mean… goodbye!&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 29 (If you have Odysseus):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Nope, I can’t see it. I know that there’s a few Servants of this world that are like the Sinners, but… the difference is just too much here.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 30 (If you have LC Vergillius):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Vergillius, so you’re here too! ‘What kind of Guide would I be if I just let you off on your own’? Well, I guess it makes sense… hold on you can hear me now!?&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 31 (If you have LC Charon):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Hi Charon, it’s wonderful to see you again. And now that the bus is also here, we can Extract again… Huh? What’s a ‘pseudo-servant’? YOU’RE A GOD!?&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 32 (If you have LC Hermann):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;I cannot accept you, and I will not let Gregor become you plaything again. He is my Sinner and I am his Manager, whatever you plan on doing, it won’t work. I’ll make sure of it.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 33 (If you have LC Sonya):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;I don’t know what to make of you. You obviously know more about life in the City than I do, so you have more right than me to change it… but you’re also working with our enemies, even if I don’t disagree with the actions of Yurodiviye, we’ll still come to blows anyway…&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 34 (If you have LC Krommer):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;We couldn’t defeat you back in Calw, but we aren’t the same as back then. Try your worst, we will overcome it.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 35 (If you have Dongrang or Dongbaek):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;I know we were enemies in the past, but I honestly could never bring myself to dislike you. Since we’re on the same side here, why not try to get along? Surely, you also wish to see Yi Sang’s wings in full, don’t you?&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 36 (If you have LC Ahab):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;You lost, Ahab, and you can’t make things back to how they were before, either. There’s no longer a Whale for you to hunt, so why do you still… no, it doesn’t matter, Ishmael chose to tie her boat to ours, she chose to go on her own journey alongside us, as her compass I will never abandon her. Stay out of her way, Ahab, there’s no meaning to us fighting here.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 37 (If you have Erlking Heathcliff):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Was the Mirror not enough? You would travel even to a completely different World for your quest? I won’t let you harm our Heathcliff, not matter what kind of ‘justification’ you have.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 38 (If you have LC Nelly):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Why did you do it? Back then, if you hadn’t burnt those letters then maybe… No, you made your choice, and there’s nothing we can do to change it. I don’t hate you, but whether we are enemies or not, is something for Heathcliff to decide.&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 39 (If you have La Manchaland&amp;#39;s Don Quixote):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;I’m sorry.

W-wait, what’s wrong?&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialogue 45 (If you have Mayors):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Mayors, you may not be my Sinner but that doesn’t mean I can&amp;#39;t help you on your journey.

When we’re using it everything is great. It drafts perfectly and have never experienced any issues with smoke in the house or anything. I always leave the flue open for 12-24 hours after we’re done using it to allow the fire to fully burn itself out (we use kiln-dried firewood that burns fairly fast), and even during that time (when the flue is open but there’s no heat source establishing an upward draft) we don’t really have any issues. But as soon as a close the damper, even if it’s DAYS later, that’s when the entire lower level of our house starts to reek of soot.\n\nWhat gives?\n\nWe don’t have any kind of fresh air intake for the fireplace or the house itself but it’s anything but airtight with my most recent blower door test pinning it at around a 10 ACH50. Fairly typical 1960s house otherwise- fan-assisted 80% furnace, atmospheric ventilated hot water heater, 300 cfm microwave/kitchen hood fan, a few 50/80 cfm bathroom fans, almost never being operated simultaneously. I don’t think it’s a pressure issue or the chimney snorkeling my house, but can’t think of what is causing this smell. Leaving the flue open 24/7 doesn’t seem like a logical solution either especially now with temperatures in the single digits.\n\nWhat am I missing / not thinking of?",

I have a wood burning masonry fireplace and chimney with a round metal flue and a top-mount damper. When we’re using it everything is great. It drafts perfectly and have never experienced any issues with smoke in the house or anything. I always leave the flue open for 12-24 hours after we’re done using it to allow the fire to fully burn itself out (we use kiln-dried firewood that burns fairly fast), and even during that time (when the flue is open but there’s no heat source establishing an upward draft) we don’t really have any issues. But as soon as a close the damper, even if it’s DAYS later, that’s when the entire lower level of our house starts to reek of soot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What gives?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We don’t have any kind of fresh air intake for the fireplace or the house itself but it’s anything but airtight with my most recent blower door test pinning it at around a 10 ACH50. Fairly typical 1960s house otherwise- fan-assisted 80% furnace, atmospheric ventilated hot water heater, 300 cfm microwave/kitchen hood fan, a few 50/80 cfm bathroom fans, almost never being operated simultaneously. I don’t think it’s a pressure issue or the chimney snorkeling my house, but can’t think of what is causing this smell. Leaving the flue open 24/7 doesn’t seem like a logical solution either especially now with temperatures in the single digits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What am I missing / not thinking of?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "I’ve been deep in a retro phase lately and wanted to see how far I could push a **1960s old Hollywood bathroom editorial** without it drifting into something too modern or stylized.\n\nThe idea was to capture that very specific kind of vintage glamour — relaxed, intimate, slightly indulgent — the kind of scene that feels like a behind-the-scenes moment rather than a posed shoot. A woman in curlers, mid-bath, soft light, no rush. Almost cinematic.\n\n1. Go to **Nano Banana Pro**\n2. Write the full prompt given below\n3. Upload your reference image\n4. Click to the \"Generate\" and get the edited image\n\n# Prompt:\n\n\"{ \"prompt\": \"Vintage glamour bathroom portrait, young woman from the reference image with same color hair in large black velcro hair rollers curlers, relaxing in white bubble bath filled bathtub, holding unlit cigarette near lips, looking directly at camera with sultry expression, light blue green eyes, natural makeup with nude pink lips, silver cross pendant choker necklace, gold rings on fingers, gold chain bracelet, white foam bubbles covering body in tub, pink tile bathroom walls, retro 1960s aesthetic, editorial fashion photography, old Hollywood glamour mood, shot from above angle looking down, warm soft lighting\", \"negative\\_prompt\": \"outdoor, fully clothed, standing, modern minimalist bathroom, dark hair, harsh lighting, serious expression\", \"style\": \"vintage glamour editorial, retro 1960s bathroom portrait, old Hollywood aesthetic, feminine luxury\", \"aspect\\_ratio\": \"3:4\", \"camera\": { \"type\": \"professional fashion photography\", \"angle\": \"overhead angle looking down into bathtub\", \"framing\": \"medium close-up, upper body visible above bubble foam\" }, \"lighting\": { \"type\": \"soft warm studio or natural bathroom lighting\", \"quality\": \"warm soft diffused light, flattering on skin\", \"atmosphere\": \"intimate vintage bathroom setting\" }, \"mood\": \"glamorous, vintage, sultry, relaxed, feminine, retro luxury\", \"color\\_palette\": \"platinum blonde, pink tiles, white bubbles foam, black hair rollers, gold jewelry accents, fair skin tones\", \"subject\\_features\": { \"hair\": \"platinum white blonde, set in large black velcro hair rollers throughout, vintage styling\", \"skin\": \"fair, natural, wet with water droplets and soap suds\", \"eyes\": \"light blue green, direct gaze at camera, natural lashes\", \"lips\": \"natural nude pink, slightly parted\", \"eyebrows\": \"natural, well groomed\", \"expression\": \"sultry, relaxed, direct eye contact, slight pout\" }, \"accessories\": { \"necklace\": \"silver cross pendant on thin choker chain around neck\", \"rings\": \"gold rings on fingers\", \"bracelet\": \"gold chain bracelet on wrist\" }, \"props\": { \"main\": \"unlit cigarette held in right hand near lips\" }, \"pose\": { \"position\": \"lying in bathtub filled with bubble foam\", \"body\": \"submerged in bubbles, shoulders and arms visible\", \"hand\": \"right hand holding cigarette up to mouth\", \"gaze\": \"looking directly up at camera\" }, \"setting\": { \"location\": \"vintage pink tiled bathroom\", \"bathtub\": \"white bathtub filled with white bubble bath foam suds\", \"walls\": \"pink ceramic tile bathroom walls\", \"floor\": \"brown and white mosaic tile floor visible at bottom edge\", \"accessories\": \"white towel rack visible on wall\", \"atmosphere\": \"retro 1960s vintage bathroom aesthetic\" } }\"\n\nA few things I paid close attention to during the build:\n\n**1. Camera &amp; Composition**  \nThe overhead angle was non-negotiable. Shooting down into the bathtub instantly creates that editorial, fashion-magazine feel and avoids the “portrait selfie” look. Keeping it as a medium close-up also helped balance intimacy without overexposure.\n\n**2. Lighting Choices**  \nWarm, diffused lighting was key. Anything too contrasty or dramatic started to break the illusion and made it feel modern. The goal was flattering, soft highlights on skin and bubbles — almost like practical bathroom lighting but elevated.\n\n**3. Material &amp; Texture Details**  \nSmall details made a big difference here:\n\n* Bubble foam thickness and randomness\n* Slight wet sheen on skin\n* Velvet-like softness in the lighting falloff\n* Gold jewelry catching warm highlights versus silver staying subtle\n\nWithout these, the image quickly felt flat or overly synthetic.\n\n**4. Styling &amp; Storytelling**  \nThe curlers, pink tiles, cigarette, and minimal jewelry aren’t just props — they do most of the narrative work. Together, they signal *time period, mood, and attitude* instantly. I avoided heavy makeup or dramatic expressions on purpose to keep it grounded and natural.\n\nThat structure made the output far more consistent and easier to iterate on when tweaking individual elements.\n\nOverall, this was a fun exercise in **restraint** — resisting the urge to over-stylize and letting subtle choices sell the realism. Retro aesthetics are surprisingly unforgiving; one modern lighting cue or pose can break the illusion instantly.\n\nCurious how others approach vintage or editorial realism — especially keeping a strong time-period identity without drifting into modern fashion imagery.

A woman in curlers, mid-bath, soft light, no rush.

Camera &amp;amp; Composition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThe overhead angle was non-negotiable. Shooting down into the bathtub instantly creates that editorial, fashion-magazine feel and avoids the “portrait selfie” look. Keeping it as a medium close-up also helped balance intimacy without overexposure.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Lighting Choices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nWarm, diffused lighting was key. Anything too contrasty or dramatic started to break the illusion and made it feel modern. The goal was flattering, soft highlights on skin and bubbles — almost like practical bathroom lighting but elevated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Material &amp;amp; Texture Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nSmall details made a big difference here:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Bubble foam thickness and randomness&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Slight wet sheen on skin&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Velvet-like softness in the lighting falloff&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Gold jewelry catching warm highlights versus silver staying subtle&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without these, the image quickly felt flat or overly synthetic.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Styling &amp;amp; Storytelling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\nThe curlers, pink tiles, cigarette, and minimal jewelry aren’t just props — they do most of the narrative work. Together, they signal &lt;em&gt;time period, mood, and attitude&lt;/em&gt; instantly. I avoided heavy makeup or dramatic expressions on purpose to keep it grounded and natural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That structure made the output far more consistent and easier to iterate on when tweaking individual elements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, this was a fun exercise in &lt;strong&gt;restraint&lt;/strong&gt; — resisting the urge to over-stylize and letting subtle choices sell the realism. Retro aesthetics are surprisingly unforgiving; one modern lighting cue or pose can break the illusion instantly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Curious how others approach vintage or editorial realism — especially keeping a strong time-period identity without drifting into modern fashion imagery. Share your editorial bathroom portraits below!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Whether you're in **Pembroke Pines**, **Weston**, or **Davie**, picking the wrong tool for your kid's teeth means longer treatment times and more time stuck in traffic on I-95.\n\nWe broke down the data at [SMILE-FX Orthodontics](https://smile-fx.com/) based on thousands of cases.\n\nHere is the straightforward breakdown to help you decide.\n\n***\n\n## 🥊 The Showdown: Braces vs. Invisalign\n\nIf your kid forgets to charge their phone, they will forget to wear their aligners. Be honest with yourself about their discipline level.\n\n| Feature | **Traditional Braces** | **Invisalign for Teens** |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Best For** | Heavy lifting (Deep overbites, severe crowding) | Mild-moderate alignment &amp; \"Selfie-ready\" smiles |\n| **Discipline Level** | **Zero.** They are glued on. | **High.** Requires 20-22h/day wear time. |\n| **Activities** | Sports-friendly (with custom mouthguards) | Sports-friendly (just pop them out) |\n| **Treatment Time** | 18-24 Months (Faster with [AI Bonding](https://smile-fx.com/braces/)) | 12-18 Months (If compliant) |\n| **Visibility** | High (Metal/Ceramic/Gold) | Nearly Invisible |\n\n&gt; **PRO TIP:** If your teen is a linebacker at Western High or plays travel soccer in **Cooper City**, you usually want **Braces**. Why? No lost aligners on the field. If they are in drama or debate at Taravella? **Invisalign**.\n\n***\n\n## ⚠️ The \"General Dentist\" Trap\n\nStop letting general dentists do orthodontic work.\n\nYou wouldn't ask your GP to perform knee surgery. General dentists often use \"Aligner Mills\" (high volume, low precision).\n\n**Board-Certified Orthodontists** (like Dr. Tracy M. Liang at our [Miramar Studio](https://smile-fx.com/why-smile-fx/board-certified-specialist/)) use 3D facial mapping. We aren't just straightening teeth; we are protecting the jaw joint and airway.\n\n**The Value Equation:**\n*   **General Dentist/DTC Aligners:** Cheaper upfront → Slower results → Bite issues later → **More Expensive Long Term.**\n*   **Specialist:** Precision tech → Up to 40% fewer office visits → Done right the first time.\n\n***\n\n## 📍 Is The Drive Worth It? (Local Guide)\n\nFamilies drive to us from all over Broward because our tech reduces total visits. Here is the logic based on where you live:\n\n*   **Pembroke Pines:** You are 10 minutes away via Pines Blvd. Easy post-school run.\n*   **Weston:** 12 mins down Miramar Pkwy. We handle a ton of competitive sports kids here who need heavy-duty bite correction.\n*   **Hollywood:** 15 mins. Beach-bound teens usually demand [Invisalign](https://smile-fx.com/invisalign/) for the aesthetics. We handle the remote monitoring so you aren't driving back and forth constantly.\n*   **Davie:** High equestrian/rodeo population. We have durable options for active lifestyles.\n*   **Fort Lauderdale:** 20 mins. Urban parents commute here specifically because they want a specialist, not a generalist.\n\n***\n\n## 🔥 Rapid Fire FAQs\n\n**Q: Price difference?**\n**A:** Varies by case complexity. Insurance fits both. Use our [Smile Quiz](https://smile-fx.com/patient-resources/smile-quiz/) to see where you stand.\n\n**Q: Retainers?**\n**A:** At SMILE-FX, clear aligner retainers are **included**. Don't pay extra for retention.\n\n**Q: Do you speak Spanish/Mandarin?**\n**A:** Yes. Our staff is trilingual.\n\n**Q: Pain?**\n**A:** Minimal. Aligners are gentler initially. Braces have \"tightening\" days, but our AI protocol minimizes force.\n\n***\n\n**Stop Guessing.**\n\nYou want a confident kid and fewer trips to the office.\n\nStart with a **[Free Virtual Consultation](https://smile-fx.com/lp/virtual-consult/)** or book an in-person scan at our Miramar studio.\n\n📍 **SMILE-FX Orthodontics &amp; Clear Aligner Studio**\nServing Miramar, Pembroke Pines, Hollywood, Weston, Cooper City, Davie, &amp; Fort Lauderdale.\n👉 **[Contact Us Here](https://smile-fx.com/contact-us/)**",

          "selftext": "\nTrue Heiress Returns to Her \"Unemployed\" Rich Family\n\n\nChapter 1 Kicked Out\n\n\nOn the day Arabella Macdonald left, she thought she could slip away from the Macdonald Villa quietly.\n\nBut her adoptive mother, Freya Macdonald, called her in right before her departure.\n\nSeeing the Macdonald family's true daughter, Harper Macdonald, curled up on the sofa with Dylan Johnston, the playboy heir of the Johnston family, Arabella understood everything instantly.\n\nThe Macdonald family and the Johnston family had an existing engagement.\n\nDylan had always claimed to be her fiancé, showering her with attention since high school.\n\nHe pulled out all the stops to win her over.\n\nAnd yet, Harper had been back for less than a week, and he was already wrapped around her finger.\n\nHe never liked me. He just liked the title 'the Macdonald family's daughter'.\n\nSeeing Arabella had noticed, Freya didn't bother hiding anything.\n\n\"Arabella, you can see for yourself,\" Freya said. \"Harper and Dylan are simply a better match.\n\n\"The engagement with the Johnston family was originally for you. But you and Dylan never had any spark. Harper and he connected almost immediately.\n\n\"You can't force it. Fate decides who belongs with whom.\n\n\"I expect you won't cause any trouble for Dylan going forward. The two of them will be announcing their engagement soon.\"\n\nArabella had thought they had something important to say. She raised a mocking eyebrow. \"You should be saying this to Dylan. He's the one who's been clinging to me for years. I have zero interest in him.\"\n\nA snake like him? I've seen through him long ago.\n\nTrash like that, anyone can have him.\n\nBeing looked down on by Arabella for years had filled Dylan with resentment.\n\nNow that she was exposed as a fake, her haughty attitude infuriated him.\n\nHe sneered, \"Listen to the impostor, talking big!\n\n\"No wonder I never felt a spark all these years. You are a fraud!\n\n\"Thank God we never finalized the wedding plans. Imagine if I'd ended up married to a counterfeit!\"\n\nHe ridiculed her status with disgust, though inwardly he felt a pang of regret.\n\nArabella's looks and figure are miles above Harper's.\n\nWhat a waste that she isn't the real daughter of the Macdonald family.\n\nHearing his shameless words, Arabella couldn't help but laugh coldly. \"I should be the one saying that. Thank goodness someone stepped in to take out the trash—saved me from having to look at that pizza face of yours any longer.\"\n\n\"You!\" Dylan's pockmarked face twisted with rage.\n\nSeeing her boyfriend being mocked, Harper felt spiteful but put on a show of sympathy. \"Dylan, don't be so harsh. You'll hurt Arabella's feelings.\n\n\"If I hadn't come back, I wouldn't have 'taken' you from her, or her place as the Macdonald daughter.\"\n\n\"Anything she says now comes from a place of pain. Just let it go.\" Harper played the understanding one perfectly.\n\nArabella looked at her and cut her performance short. \"My feelings aren't hurt. That garbage chased me for seven or eight years, and I never gave him a second glance. But you? You latched onto him in a week. Trash meets scheming bitch. A perfect match.\"\n\nThis directly provoked Freya. \"You ungrateful wretch! Such a vicious tongue!\n\n\"No wonder I could never warm up to you. You're ill-mannered at your core!\n\n\"You took Harper's place and lived in luxury for eighteen years. She suffered in a sanitation worker's home. And you dare speak to her like that?\n\n\"Outrageous!\"\n\nBeing scolded, Arabella's gaze only grew colder and more indifferent.\n\nThe \"luxury\" she enjoyed in the Macdonald family was entirely self-made.\n\nHer adoptive father, Carter Macdonald, was a terrible businessman. He was hardworking in his youth and saved up to open a factory, but he had no real business sense.\n\nIf not for her secret assistance, that factory would have gone under at least eight times over.\n\nThe Macdonald family would never have moved to Doranor City, let alone become one of the three biggest merchants in the Meridian District.\n\nBut Arabella had never told Carter and Freya any of this. They had no idea the factory's biggest investor was her.\n\nCarter hadn't wanted to get involved, but the arguing downstairs forced him to make an appearance.\n\nHe came down, deliberately frowning at Freya to look like the good guy. \"Enough. Is that any way to talk to her?\n\n\"Arabella is going back to her birth family today. She'll have enough hardships. We're the ones who made the mistake all those years ago. It's not her fault. Don't send her off with such coldness.\"\n\nThough his kindness was an act, Carter was at least being fair.\n\nStill, looking at Arabella, his feelings were complicated. I have always been fond of her. She has been a lovely child.\n\nBut if she hadn't been here, we wouldn't have gone eighteen years without looking for our real daughter. Harper wouldn't have suffered so much then.\n\nHe sighed, \"Arabella, you may not be my blood, but I raised you for eighteen years. In my heart, you're still a daughter to me.\n\n\"I've made some inquiries. Your birth parents seem to be unemployed. If you ever need help in the future, don't hesitate to come to me.\" It was a hollow offer, pure hypocrisy.\n\nFreya immediately elbowed him, standing up. \"Why are you being so charitable? They'll latch onto you like leeches!\"\n\nParents with no proper jobs? What kind of family is that?\n\nArabella looked at the hypocritical Macdonald family and Dylan, her expression detached. \"That won't be necessary, Mr. Macdonald. If anything, you should be more careful managing the factory and the company from now on. Especially... watch the people closest to you.\"\n\nHer eyes flickered toward Freya, her meaning clear.\n\nThere was a real snake in the company.\n\nFreya and her older brother had been embezzling for years. If Arabella hadn't been secretly keeping watch on them, they would have drained half the company's funds by now.\n\nIf her birth family were truly poor, she wouldn't have the time to watch over the Macdonald family's interests anymore.\n\nHearing this, Freya exploded. \"You just can't stand to see us do well, can you? Cursing the company on your way out? Talking as if you ever managed your dad's factory? Who do you think you are?\"\n\nArabella knew arguing with Freya was pointless. She just snorted, \"You'll find out exactly who I am soon enough.\"\n\nLet's see how tough you are then.\n\nTired of the talk, Arabella stood up and slung her only backpack over her shoulder.\n\nIt held just her documents and the laptop she bought herself. She was taking nothing else.\n\nDylan, however, couldn't resist a final jab. \"Mr. Macdonald, Mrs. Macdonald, she's not taking any luggage. That bag might be stuffed with valuables. You should probably check it.\"\n\nLet's see how high and mighty she is after a search.\n\nFreya seized on the idea. \"Dylan's right! Open it up. Let's see what's inside.\"    \n\n\nChapter 2 Fawning Over That Impostor\n\n\nHarper quickly put on an act. \"Mom, isn't that a bit much? Arabella's family is so poor. Even if she took a few things, it would just help her get by. Let it go.\"\n\nFreya sneered, \"Everything in her room was bought by your father and me. What right does she have to use our things to 'get by'? Her parents are unemployed. A few trinkets won't fix that.\"\n\nWith that, Freya moved to check Arabella's backpack.\n\nBut Arabella, as if expecting this pettiness, simply opened the bag herself. \"There's nothing from the Macdonald family in here. My ID is mine. This laptop, and the clothes I'm wearing, were bought with my scholarship money.\"\n\nIf she hadn't been the one supporting the entire household all these years—and didn't want to leave them a cent—she would have thrown money in their faces.\n\nBut they weren't worth it.\n\nSeeing Arabella truly had taken nothing, Harper and Dylan looked disappointed.\n\nShe actually has some pride.\n\nWith the Macdonald family speechless, Arabella shouldered her backpack to leave.\n\nBut then a weak voice called from the stairs. \"Arabella... Wait...\"\n\nThe family turned, stunned.\n\nIt was Edward Macdonald, who had just had major surgery, hurrying downstairs.\n\nSeeing her precious son, Freya rushed to support him. \"Edward! It's nothing important. You should be resting. Why did you come down?\"\n\nEdward had severe aplastic anemia. He'd recently had a bone marrow transplant performed by a reclusive specialist. The surgery was successful, but he was in recovery—a time when stress and exertion were dangerous. They'd deliberately kept him from seeing Arabella off.\n\nYet here he was.\n\nSeeing her frail older brother, who had always protected her, a ripple of emotion stirred in Arabella's cold heart. She paused.\n\nEdward shot Freya an annoyed look. \"If you hadn't had Albie babysit me, I wouldn't have had to rush.\"\n\nThe butler, Albie Allan, had refused to let him come down. He'd only managed by sending Albie away.\n\nHe was just glad Arabella was still there.\n\nWithout ceremony, Edward pulled out a bank card and pressed it into Arabella's hand.\n\nHe said, \"Arabella, Dad told me. Your birth parents don't work. Your brothers... don't seem to have proper jobs either. Some are still in school. I'm worried you'd have no money over there. This is my savings. Take it, for emergencies.\"\n\nHolding the card, Arabella felt a genuine warmth.\n\nSo, in this whole family, only Edward truly cares about me.\n\nIt made all her efforts to research his illness and ensure his surgery was successful worth it. Leaving him was her only real regret.\n\nSeeing Edward give money away, Freya panicked. \"You foolish boy! What are you doing? That's your only card! There's at least a hundred thousand dollars in there. Why give it to her? She's not your real sister!\"\n\nHearing this, Harper grew anxious but played the victim. \"Edward is so kind... so generous to Arabella. He's barely spoken to me since I came home.\"\n\nSeeing her upset, Dylan jumped in. \"Edward, you're way too biased. You're cold to your own sister but fawning over that impostor?\"\n\n\"You!\" Edward, insulted, was immediately furious.\n\nSeeing Edward's anger, Arabella's eyes darkened. She picked up a glass of water and threw it in Dylan's face.\n\nDylan, the Johnston family heir, had never been treated like this. He roared in outrage, \"Arabella! How dare you!\"\n\nBut Arabella's gaze was icy and terrifying. \"Dylan, this is the Macdonald Villa. Who do you think you are, yelling at the master of the house? Edward just had major surgery. He can't get agitated. Watch your mouth!\"\n\nDylan, relying on the two families' long friendship, had always overstayed his welcome at the villa. First, it was to pester her. Now, with Harper by his side, he'd become even more brazen. But daring to speak to Edward like that? He was overstepping.\n\nKnowing he'd offended Edward, and seeing the dark looks on Carter and Freya's faces, Dylan backed down.\n\nHarper seized the chance to stir the pot. \"Mom, Dad, even if she was defending Edward, Arabella went too far. Throwing water? So rude.\"\n\nHarper really knows how to twist the knife.\n\nArabella had had enough. She pressed the card back into Edward's hand. \"Edward, you need to focus on recovery. Buy yourself some proper supplements. Keep the money for yourself.\"\n\n\"Arabella...\" Edward tried to protest, but Arabella firmly gripped his hand.\n\nFor a girl, her grip was surprisingly strong. He couldn't pull free.\n\nArabella gave him a sincere smile, saying, \"I appreciate the thought. But Edward, don't worry. I'm not short on money. Take good care of yourself after I'm gone.\"\n\nWith that, she released his hand.\n\nEdward, flustered, tried to give her the card again.\n\nBut Arabella was already walking away, her departure as cool and decisive as her demeanor.\n\nDylan muttered bitterly, \"'Not short on money'? Still playing the big shot even now? Arabella, you're such a phony!\"\n\nThe words had festered for seven or eight years. Finally saying them didn't make him feel better, though.\n\nThat wretched woman, splashing me even on her way out. Damn it!\n\nSeeing his embarrassed state, Harper quickly fetched a handkerchief to dab his face.\n\nFreya, seeing Edward had the card back, snatched it. \"Thank goodness she has some shame. Could you imagine the loss?\"\n\nOutside, seeing no driver of the Macdonald family was going to offer her a ride, Arabella pulled out her phone to call a car.\n\nBut just then, a sleek, black, unmarked sports car pulled up.\n\nShe couldn't identify the make, but the engine's purr told her it was no ordinary vehicle.\n\nIn the sunlight, the black paint had a deep, luminous sheen.\n\nThe color and finish whispered of hidden luxury.\n\nThe tires and rims were high-end, too.\n\nThis was clearly a custom, modified car for the ultra-wealthy, easily worth as much as a Bugatti or Lamborghini.\n\nDid some big shot just arrive?\n\nTo Arabella's surprise, the man who got out looked anything but a big shot. He was dressed shabbily, with dark circles under his eyes.\n\nHe wasn't much older than her, maybe four or five years, but he was unshaven and seemed generally worn out. Despite his disheveled appearance, his eyes were sharp and alert.\n\nThey landed on Arabella, and a flicker of surprise passed through them. \"You must be Arabella, right?\" he asked.  \n\n\nChapter 3 Dislocating the Scumbag's Arm\n\n\nHe continued, \"You and Mom... You really look like twins.\"\n\nHis family said they'd send someone to pick up Arabella today. He'd just finished a case and was on leave, so he offered to swing by and get her. That way, the family could just wait and welcome them both home.\n\nHe thought he might need an introduction at the Macdonald Villa. But one look at Arabella, and he knew.\n\nSeeing the man's face, which bore a clear resemblance to her own, Arabella raised an eyebrow. \"You're... my brother?\"\n\nAlfred Hamilton quickly introduced himself, \"Yes. I'm Alfred Hamilton, your third brother.\"\n\nOnly then did Alfred notice Arabella's odd look. He glanced down and remembered.\n\nRight. I've been on a stakeout for that drug lord for days. Barely slept, and haven't changed clothes. I just came straight here. Too tired on the drive to even think about buying a new suit.\n\n\"Sorry, I came in a rush. Forgot to change...\" Alfred was cold and indifferent in his unit, an unyielding leader. But here, in front of his little sister, he felt uncharacteristically embarrassed.\n\nArabella was about to say it was fine when Harper's voice piped up from behind them. \"Where did this beggar come from? Security! How did you just let someone wander in?\"\n\nThe villa's security guard hurried over. \"Ms. Macdonald, he said he was here to pick up Arabella. So I let him through.\"\n\nHearing this, Harper turned to Arabella with feigned surprise. \"Oh... Arabella, I'm so sorry. I didn't know this was your family. Please don't mind what I just said.\"\n\nArabella looked at her coldly. \"If you're sorry, then shut up. No one wants to hear you talk.\"\n\nWith that, she walked past Harper, opened the passenger door of Alfred's car, and tossed her backpack inside.\n\nDylan had followed them out, eager to get back at her for the water incident.\n\nSeeing Alfred's car with no visible brand logo, he sneered, \"Well, well. I've never seen a car without a badge. Did your family assemble this themselves in the backyard?\"\n\nAlfred, still leaning tiredly against the car, replied calmly, \"Actually, yes. We did.\"\n\nThey were special forces. Every vehicle was heavily modified. His, in particular, had been designed by their fifth brother, Daniel Hamilton.\n\nDaniel was still a PhD student but was already a weaponry design expert earmarked by the Defense Department. The weapons and vehicles he designed, once modified, were exceptionally powerful and had unmatched performance—they could even save your life in a crisis. So this car's value far exceeded any luxury vehicle on the market, and its modification cost alone rivaled a supercar's.\n\nDylan, of course, missed the meaning entirely. He kept mocking Arabella. \"I'm shocked your family even has a car. But with no logo... maybe it's stolen?\"\n\nHarper played along, pretending to be concerned. \"Arabella, you should be careful. What if you accidentally become an accessory? You could get in serious legal trouble.\"\n\nArabella was rolling her eyes.\n\nTheir nonsense inside was bad enough. Now they're outside, taunting my family?\n\nShe'd had enough.\n\nBut before she could speak, Alfred's expression darkened. He walked straight toward them.\n\nAlfred was over six feet tall. Standing in front of Dylan, he seemed like a giant. He clapped a heavy hand on Dylan's shoulder and said, \"Kid, you can eat whatever you want, but you can't say whatever you want. Did no one ever teach you that?\"\n\nYears of running devil training for his team and interrogating prisoners had earned Alfred a nickname—Ruthless Death. The look on his face now made Dylan feel like he might wet himself.\n\nHe'd never seen anyone with such a terrifying presence.\n\n\"I... I was just... speculating...\" he said.\n\nAlfred snorted, \"Speculating? This country may have free speech, but you're legally responsible for every word you say. If your parents didn't teach you, I can.\"\n\nAs he spoke, the hand on Dylan's shoulder tightened slightly.\n\nThere was a sickening crack. Dylan's shoulder was dislocated in an instant.\n\nDylan felt like his arm had vanished. Excruciating pain made him shriek. \"Ah! Okay! I won't! Let me go!\"\n\nOnly then did Alfred, his face still cold, sharply pull the arm back into place.\n\nDylan was now pale and speechless with fear. But Harper still hadn't understood what was going on.\n\nAlfred glanced sideways at Harper. She shuddered violently.\n\nHis eyes are terrifying.\n\n\"Little girl,\" Alfred said, his voice low. \"I don't hit women. I'll let you off today. Next time I see you, keep your mouth clean. I don't like anyone cursing my family.\"\n\nTalking about my sister getting in serious legal trouble?\n\nYou're asking for it.\n\nHarper could only nod, thoroughly cowed.\n\nAlfred finally released the coercion. He turned back to Arabella with a warm smile. \"Arabella, let's go.\"\n\nArabella looked at his smiling face. It was hard to believe this was the same intimidating man from moments ago.\n\nAlfred is definitely not ordinary.\n\nBut since he has handled Dylan and Harper, I should play the sweet little sister.\n\n\"Okay, Alfred.\" She climbed into the passenger seat with a smile.\n\nAlfred didn't think much of it. He got in the driver's side, buckled up, and drove away from the Macdonald Villa.\n\nHarper and Dylan were left behind, watching the car disappear, their hearts still pounding.\n\n\"What was that guy?\" Dylan muttered, moving his now-functional arm, the fear lingering.\n\nHarper shook her head. \"I don't know. But his license plate... I think it was a Doranor City plate. And... it looked like a government plate.\"\n\nThat's so strange. He looked so scruffy. How could he be driving a Doranor City government vehicle?\n\n\"You must have seen wrong.\" Dylan shook his head. He'd been too scared to notice details, but his gut said she was mistaken.\n\nArabella's birth family is supposedly full of unemployed drifters. How could they afford a Doranor City plate? Only locals can get those.\n\nGetting residency in Doranor City isn't for ordinary people. You are either born into wealth or married into it. The Macdonald family is rich, but even they have out-of-town plates.\n\nArabella's family has to be dirt poor. There is no way they are Doranor City locals.\n\nSo she must have been seeing things.\n\n\nChapter 4 Is This for Real?\n\n\nIn the car, Alfred, still feeling a bit awkward, said, \"Sorry about that, Arabella. I came in such a hurry. I forgot to change. I know I'm a mess. Didn't mean to make you the subject of gossip.\"\n\nHe'd never cared about his appearance before. But he couldn't embarrass Arabella like that again.\n\nArabella gave an understanding shake of her head. \"It's fine. Clothes should be comfortable, that's all.\"\n\nAlfred immediately felt more fond of her.\n\nNoticing she only had the backpack, he asked, \"Arabella, is that all your luggage? Just the one bag?\"\n\nArabella nodded, her tone cool. \"I didn't want a single thing from the Macdonald family.\"\n\nAlfred was highly observant. He caught the edge in her voice, and his eyes turned cold.\n\nDid that family make her unhappy?\n\nThen he said gently, \"It's okay. Once we're home, I'll buy you anything you want.\"\n\nArabella offered a warm smile. \"Okay.\"\n\nWhatever my family's real situation is, at least Alfred seems genuinely kind.\n\nArabella noticed the route Alfred was taking. She couldn't help asking, \"Alfred, isn't this the road to Oceanview Peak?\"\n\nOceanview Peak was where Doranor City's wealthiest, most powerful, and most prestigious families lived.\n\nThe Peak was enormous, covering almost the entire Sunspire District. Driving up the winding road, they passed massive villa clusters and luxurious estates.\n\nThe Macdonald family, new to the city, had made it their mission to learn that Doranor City's ten oldest, most influential families were all clustered here in the Sunspire District.\n\nThe problem was that the roads up the mountain had security checkpoints. Unless you were a resident or had an invitation from one, you couldn't enter Oceanview Peak.\n\nYet their car only paused briefly at a checkpoint. The license plate was scanned, and the gate lifted immediately.\n\nAlfred answered her question casually, \"Yeah. Mom and Dad are waiting for us at home.\"\n\nArabella's eyebrows shot up.\n\nMy home is on Oceanview Peak?\n\nI am starting to doubt Carter's investigative skills.\n\nAren't my parents and brothers supposed to be unemployed drifters?\n\nHow could Carter not even know where they live?\n\nCarter was notoriously incompetent. That was why Arabella had had to manage the company from the shadows.\n\nHe probably just heard 'unemployed' and made up the rest in his head.\n\nWell, this is good. If my family is well-off, I won't have to worry about supporting them.\n\nThey passed several impressive villas. She expected the car to stop, but it didn't.\n\nThen she saw the bigger villas. Okay, so they're a bit wealthier than I thought.\n\nAlfred drove for another ten minutes. They left the villa zone and entered the sprawling estate area. Arabella narrowed her eyes.\n\nAlright. My new family isn't just wealthy. They're seriously wealthy.\n\nJust as that thought settled, the car kept going.\n\nIt finally reached the very summit of the peak.\n\nOceanview Peak got its name because this top road was completely unobstructed, with clear ocean views on both sides.\n\nAnd at the end of this road stood only one estate.\n\nIt was a landmark visible from downtown Doranor City—Cloudrise Manor.\n\nIt was iconic because it sat at the city's highest point. From downtown, you could see this castle-like structure against the sky.\n\nIt was said to have been personally overseen by Howard Martin, the world's top architect. It was an extremely luxurious, hyper-modern landmark. From this castle, you could see the sunrise over the ocean in the morning and the most stunning sunset in the evening—hence the name.\n\nThe owner was shrouded in mystery. Rumors said even Doranor City's top ten families couldn't compare. No one knew who owned Cloudrise Manor, only that its owner was fabulously wealthy, with investments in every industry, but no family company of their own. Everything was handled by a team of top-tier butlers and stewards.\n\nNo one had ever seen the owner. Their family's true identity was unknown.\n\nArabella assumed Alfred was just driving her up to see the view. She expected they'd pass by and head down to the other side of the mountain.\n\nInstead, Alfred turned the car through the gates into the museum-like estate.\n\nUnder the sun, water danced in the central fountain, catching the light.\n\nThe sculpture at its center was a modern masterpiece, clearly worth a fortune.\n\nEven Arabella, accustomed to valuables and authenticity, knew it was top-tier.\n\nAlfred brought the car to a smooth stop right before the castle's grand entrance.\n\nBefore Arabella could process it, Alfred got out and walked around to open her door like a gentleman. \"Arabella, welcome home.\"\n\nAs he spoke, two lines of more than twenty servants flanking the red carpet at the entrance bowed in unison. \"Welcome home, Ms. Hamilton!\"\n\nFor a second, Arabella thought she'd walked onto a movie set.\n\n\"Alfred... this... is my home?\"\n\nIs this for real?\n\nEven with ample funds in her own accounts and plenty of experience with grand settings and important people, Arabella was stunned.\n\nShe had prepared herself for a run-down house, unemployed parents and brothers, and the responsibility of supporting them all.\n\nBut she never expected a complete 180-degree turn.\n\nMy family is the legendary, mysterious top-tier wealthy family of Doranor City?\n\n\nChapter 5 What if We Scared Her?\n\n\nSeeing Arabella's surprised expression, Alfred gave an indulgent smile. \"Yes, this is your home. Come on in. Mom and Dad are waiting.\"\n\nArabella took a steadying breath and got out of the car. Looking at the extravagant red carpet at her feet, she stepped onto it a bit awkwardly. \"This is... quite a welcome.\"\n\nAlfred smiled, \"It's only right.\"\n\nAfter all the hardship she has endured for so many years, her first homecoming deserves to be special.\n\nAs they spoke, two figures rushed out from behind the tall doors at the end of the carpet.\n\n\"Is that Arabella?\" Came an excited, melodic female voice.\n\nArabella looked up to see a middle-aged woman in a simple but elegant dress approaching. She was beautiful and graceful.\n\nThough past forty, she was impeccably maintained, radiating a star-like, gentle charm.\n\nBeside her was a distinguished-looking middle-aged man, tall and handsome, bearing a strong resemblance to Alfred.\n\nArabella knew instantly—these were her parents.\n\nSeeing them, the perfect image of an aristocratic couple, her image of \"unemployed drifters\" completely vanished.\n\nCarter, could you be any more incompetent?\n\nIs this what 'unemployed drifter' looks like?\n\nBy now, Florence Hamilton had reached Arabella. She took Arabella's hands in hers, her eyes instantly welling up. \"It's true. This is my daughter. Jonathan, look how much she resembles me.\"\n\nJonathan Hamilton studied Arabella's face, so similar to Florence's, and nodded in wonder. \"Yes. The likeness is remarkable.\"\n\nFlorence had been an internationally renowned star in her day, known for her extraordinary beauty.\n\nAt first, they'd never doubted Naomi Hamilton was their biological child.\n\nBut after puberty, as Naomi grew to look less and less like either Florence or Jonathan, whispers began. They, too, started to sense something was off.\n\nThey had just begun looking into it when the Macdonald family discovered the mix-up. The police compared their DNA with Arabella's, confirming she was their biological daughter.\n\nThey'd planned to run another test after she arrived. But now, seeing her, it seemed unnecessary.\n\nArabella was the spitting image of a young Florence.\n\nWithout a trace of makeup, she was stunningly beautiful in a pure, natural way.\n\nArabella was equally surprised by how much she looked like her mother.\n\nNo wonder Freya and I were never close. I was cute as a child and grew up looking nothing like her. She probably suspected I wasn't hers all along.\n\nOnce that suspicion took root, Arabella investigated and found out the truth.\n\nIt seemed this time, she had truly found her birth parents.\n\n\"Dad, Mom, it's windy out here. Let's go inside,\" Alfred suggested gently.\n\nBeing a seaside estate, the ocean breeze was strong. He didn't want Florence catching a chill.\n\nFlorence nodded eagerly. \"You're right! I was so excited I forgot. Come inside, dear.\"\n\nStill holding Arabella's hand, she led her through the doors.\n\nFeeling Florence's soft, warm hand, Arabella felt an unexpected wave of warmth.\n\nGrowing up despised by Freya, she'd rarely experienced a mother's care and affection.\n\nNow she realized a mother's touch could feel so comforting.\n\nThe group moved inside.\n\nThey passed through an entrance hall that felt more like an art gallery. The walls were lined with paintings, each flanked by ceramic or sculptural pieces.\n\nPassing one particular ceramic artwork, Arabella paused.\n\nThis piece... looks familiar.\n\nNoticing Arabella's gaze, Florence said, \"Arabella, do you like it?\"\n\nArabella hesitated, then nodded awkwardly.\n\nLike it? Well, I liked it enough when I made it. Or I wouldn't make it.\n\nBut she made so many pieces each month, bundling them off to her studio assistant to sell. This one had taken her, at most, three hours.\n\nTo think it ended up in my own parents' home... What a coincidence.\n\n\"If you like it, we can move it to your room later,\" Florence offered. \"It's a top work by a mysterious new artist. I bought it at a charity auction last month for eight million dollars. Not terribly expensive, but wonderfully creative.\"\n\nArabella's mouth twitched.\n\nEight million dollars... 'Not terribly expensive'?\n\nEven as one of Meridian District's top three merchants, the Macdonald family won't casually spend eight million dollars on such a small piece.\n\nAnd it is just something I threw together.\n\nJust how wealthy is my family?\n\nThey arrived in the grand living room.\n\nA dozen servants stood in two lines.\n\nOne group held trays with various beverages—different types of coffee and juices. The other held trays of assorted pastries.\n\nFlorence guided Arabella past them, her voice soft. \"It's your first day home, sweetheart. I didn't know what you'd like to drink, so I had them prepare every type of coffee and juice. And these pastries are from the best patisserie in Doranor City. I got one of each flavor for you to try.\"\n\nUnder Florence's expectant gaze, Arabella felt obliged to choose. She picked a hand-ground coffee and two pastries.\n\nShe said, \"I don't like things too sweet. The matcha and osmanthus flavors look just right.\"\n\nFlorence was delighted. \"I can't believe it! Even your tastes are like mine.\"\n\nIt really is family. How did I not notice how different Naomi's preferences were?\n\nThe chosen servants presented the items, and the others dispersed.\n\nAlfred said, \"Mom, Dad, I'm going to go change.\"\n\nJonathan looked at his disheveled state and sighed, \"You're the leader of INTERPOL's Special Unit A now. What sort of case is this that has you personally leading the team to look like this? Had I known you were in this state, I wouldn't have let you pick up Arabella. What if we scared her?\"\n\nAt his words, Alfred looked awkward. \"This was an international drug lord bust. It wasn't just me, even the...\"\n\n\nThe space here is limited for chapters.

He just liked the title &amp;#39;the Macdonald family&amp;#39;s daughter&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing Arabella had noticed, Freya didn&amp;#39;t bother hiding anything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Arabella, you can see for yourself,&amp;quot; Freya said. &amp;quot;Harper and Dylan are simply a better match.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The engagement with the Johnston family was originally for you. But you and Dylan never had any spark. Harper and he connected almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t force it. Fate decides who belongs with whom.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I expect you won&amp;#39;t cause any trouble for Dylan going forward. The two of them will be announcing their engagement soon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella had thought they had something important to say. She raised a mocking eyebrow. &amp;quot;You should be saying this to Dylan. He&amp;#39;s the one who&amp;#39;s been clinging to me for years. I have zero interest in him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A snake like him? I&amp;#39;ve seen through him long ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Trash like that, anyone can have him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being looked down on by Arabella for years had filled Dylan with resentment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now that she was exposed as a fake, her haughty attitude infuriated him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sneered, &amp;quot;Listen to the impostor, talking big!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No wonder I never felt a spark all these years. You are a fraud!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thank God we never finalized the wedding plans. Imagine if I&amp;#39;d ended up married to a counterfeit!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He ridiculed her status with disgust, though inwardly he felt a pang of regret.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella&amp;#39;s looks and figure are miles above Harper&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What a waste that she isn&amp;#39;t the real daughter of the Macdonald family.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hearing his shameless words, Arabella couldn&amp;#39;t help but laugh coldly. &amp;quot;I should be the one saying that. Thank goodness someone stepped in to take out the trash—saved me from having to look at that pizza face of yours any longer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You!&amp;quot; Dylan&amp;#39;s pockmarked face twisted with rage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing her boyfriend being mocked, Harper felt spiteful but put on a show of sympathy. &amp;quot;Dylan, don&amp;#39;t be so harsh. You&amp;#39;ll hurt Arabella&amp;#39;s feelings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If I hadn&amp;#39;t come back, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have &amp;#39;taken&amp;#39; you from her, or her place as the Macdonald daughter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Anything she says now comes from a place of pain. Just let it go.&amp;quot; Harper played the understanding one perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella looked at her and cut her performance short. &amp;quot;My feelings aren&amp;#39;t hurt. That garbage chased me for seven or eight years, and I never gave him a second glance. But you? You latched onto him in a week. Trash meets scheming bitch. A perfect match.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This directly provoked Freya. &amp;quot;You ungrateful wretch! Such a vicious tongue!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No wonder I could never warm up to you. You&amp;#39;re ill-mannered at your core!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You took Harper&amp;#39;s place and lived in luxury for eighteen years. She suffered in a sanitation worker&amp;#39;s home. And you dare speak to her like that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Outrageous!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being scolded, Arabella&amp;#39;s gaze only grew colder and more indifferent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;quot;luxury&amp;quot; she enjoyed in the Macdonald family was entirely self-made.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her adoptive father, Carter Macdonald, was a terrible businessman. He was hardworking in his youth and saved up to open a factory, but he had no real business sense.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If not for her secret assistance, that factory would have gone under at least eight times over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Macdonald family would never have moved to Doranor City, let alone become one of the three biggest merchants in the Meridian District.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Arabella had never told Carter and Freya any of this. They had no idea the factory&amp;#39;s biggest investor was her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carter hadn&amp;#39;t wanted to get involved, but the arguing downstairs forced him to make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He came down, deliberately frowning at Freya to look like the good guy. &amp;quot;Enough. Is that any way to talk to her?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Arabella is going back to her birth family today. She&amp;#39;ll have enough hardships. We&amp;#39;re the ones who made the mistake all those years ago. It&amp;#39;s not her fault. Don&amp;#39;t send her off with such coldness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though his kindness was an act, Carter was at least being fair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still, looking at Arabella, his feelings were complicated. I have always been fond of her. She has been a lovely child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if she hadn&amp;#39;t been here, we wouldn&amp;#39;t have gone eighteen years without looking for our real daughter. Harper wouldn&amp;#39;t have suffered so much then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He sighed, &amp;quot;Arabella, you may not be my blood, but I raised you for eighteen years. In my heart, you&amp;#39;re still a daughter to me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve made some inquiries. Your birth parents seem to be unemployed. If you ever need help in the future, don&amp;#39;t hesitate to come to me.&amp;quot; It was a hollow offer, pure hypocrisy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Freya immediately elbowed him, standing up. &amp;quot;Why are you being so charitable? They&amp;#39;ll latch onto you like leeches!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Parents with no proper jobs? What kind of family is that?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella looked at the hypocritical Macdonald family and Dylan, her expression detached. &amp;quot;That won&amp;#39;t be necessary, Mr. Macdonald. If anything, you should be more careful managing the factory and the company from now on. Especially... watch the people closest to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her eyes flickered toward Freya, her meaning clear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a real snake in the company.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Freya and her older brother had been embezzling for years. If Arabella hadn&amp;#39;t been secretly keeping watch on them, they would have drained half the company&amp;#39;s funds by now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If her birth family were truly poor, she wouldn&amp;#39;t have the time to watch over the Macdonald family&amp;#39;s interests anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hearing this, Freya exploded. &amp;quot;You just can&amp;#39;t stand to see us do well, can you? Cursing the company on your way out? Talking as if you ever managed your dad&amp;#39;s factory? Who do you think you are?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella knew arguing with Freya was pointless. She just snorted, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll find out exactly who I am soon enough.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see how tough you are then.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tired of the talk, Arabella stood up and slung her only backpack over her shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It held just her documents and the laptop she bought herself. She was taking nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dylan, however, couldn&amp;#39;t resist a final jab. &amp;quot;Mr. Macdonald, Mrs. Macdonald, she&amp;#39;s not taking any luggage. That bag might be stuffed with valuables. You should probably check it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s see how high and mighty she is after a search.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Freya seized on the idea. &amp;quot;Dylan&amp;#39;s right! Open it up. Let&amp;#39;s see what&amp;#39;s inside.&amp;quot;    &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 2 Fawning Over That Impostor&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harper quickly put on an act. &amp;quot;Mom, isn&amp;#39;t that a bit much? Arabella&amp;#39;s family is so poor. Even if she took a few things, it would just help her get by. Let it go.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Freya sneered, &amp;quot;Everything in her room was bought by your father and me. What right does she have to use our things to &amp;#39;get by&amp;#39;? Her parents are unemployed. A few trinkets won&amp;#39;t fix that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that, Freya moved to check Arabella&amp;#39;s backpack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Arabella, as if expecting this pettiness, simply opened the bag herself. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s nothing from the Macdonald family in here. My ID is mine. This laptop, and the clothes I&amp;#39;m wearing, were bought with my scholarship money.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If she hadn&amp;#39;t been the one supporting the entire household all these years—and didn&amp;#39;t want to leave them a cent—she would have thrown money in their faces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But they weren&amp;#39;t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing Arabella truly had taken nothing, Harper and Dylan looked disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She actually has some pride.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With the Macdonald family speechless, Arabella shouldered her backpack to leave.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But then a weak voice called from the stairs. &amp;quot;Arabella... Wait...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The family turned, stunned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was Edward Macdonald, who had just had major surgery, hurrying downstairs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing her precious son, Freya rushed to support him. &amp;quot;Edward! It&amp;#39;s nothing important. You should be resting. Why did you come down?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edward had severe aplastic anemia. He&amp;#39;d recently had a bone marrow transplant performed by a reclusive specialist. The surgery was successful, but he was in recovery—a time when stress and exertion were dangerous. They&amp;#39;d deliberately kept him from seeing Arabella off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet here he was.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing her frail older brother, who had always protected her, a ripple of emotion stirred in Arabella&amp;#39;s cold heart. She paused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edward shot Freya an annoyed look. &amp;quot;If you hadn&amp;#39;t had Albie babysit me, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have had to rush.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The butler, Albie Allan, had refused to let him come down. He&amp;#39;d only managed by sending Albie away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was just glad Arabella was still there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without ceremony, Edward pulled out a bank card and pressed it into Arabella&amp;#39;s hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said, &amp;quot;Arabella, Dad told me. Your birth parents don&amp;#39;t work. Your brothers... don&amp;#39;t seem to have proper jobs either. Some are still in school. I&amp;#39;m worried you&amp;#39;d have no money over there. This is my savings. Take it, for emergencies.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holding the card, Arabella felt a genuine warmth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, in this whole family, only Edward truly cares about me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It made all her efforts to research his illness and ensure his surgery was successful worth it. Leaving him was her only real regret.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing Edward give money away, Freya panicked. &amp;quot;You foolish boy! What are you doing? That&amp;#39;s your only card! There&amp;#39;s at least a hundred thousand dollars in there. Why give it to her? She&amp;#39;s not your real sister!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hearing this, Harper grew anxious but played the victim. &amp;quot;Edward is so kind... so generous to Arabella. He&amp;#39;s barely spoken to me since I came home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing her upset, Dylan jumped in. &amp;quot;Edward, you&amp;#39;re way too biased. You&amp;#39;re cold to your own sister but fawning over that impostor?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You!&amp;quot; Edward, insulted, was immediately furious.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing Edward&amp;#39;s anger, Arabella&amp;#39;s eyes darkened. She picked up a glass of water and threw it in Dylan&amp;#39;s face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dylan, the Johnston family heir, had never been treated like this. He roared in outrage, &amp;quot;Arabella! How dare you!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Arabella&amp;#39;s gaze was icy and terrifying. &amp;quot;Dylan, this is the Macdonald Villa. Who do you think you are, yelling at the master of the house? Edward just had major surgery. He can&amp;#39;t get agitated. Watch your mouth!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dylan, relying on the two families&amp;#39; long friendship, had always overstayed his welcome at the villa. First, it was to pester her. Now, with Harper by his side, he&amp;#39;d become even more brazen. But daring to speak to Edward like that? He was overstepping.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowing he&amp;#39;d offended Edward, and seeing the dark looks on Carter and Freya&amp;#39;s faces, Dylan backed down.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harper seized the chance to stir the pot. &amp;quot;Mom, Dad, even if she was defending Edward, Arabella went too far. Throwing water? So rude.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harper really knows how to twist the knife.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella had had enough. She pressed the card back into Edward&amp;#39;s hand. &amp;quot;Edward, you need to focus on recovery. Buy yourself some proper supplements. Keep the money for yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Arabella...&amp;quot; Edward tried to protest, but Arabella firmly gripped his hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a girl, her grip was surprisingly strong. He couldn&amp;#39;t pull free.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella gave him a sincere smile, saying, &amp;quot;I appreciate the thought. But Edward, don&amp;#39;t worry. I&amp;#39;m not short on money. Take good care of yourself after I&amp;#39;m gone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that, she released his hand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edward, flustered, tried to give her the card again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Arabella was already walking away, her departure as cool and decisive as her demeanor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dylan muttered bitterly, &amp;quot;&amp;#39;Not short on money&amp;#39;? Still playing the big shot even now? Arabella, you&amp;#39;re such a phony!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The words had festered for seven or eight years. Finally saying them didn&amp;#39;t make him feel better, though.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That wretched woman, splashing me even on her way out. Damn it!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing his embarrassed state, Harper quickly fetched a handkerchief to dab his face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Freya, seeing Edward had the card back, snatched it. &amp;quot;Thank goodness she has some shame. Could you imagine the loss?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Outside, seeing no driver of the Macdonald family was going to offer her a ride, Arabella pulled out her phone to call a car.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But just then, a sleek, black, unmarked sports car pulled up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She couldn&amp;#39;t identify the make, but the engine&amp;#39;s purr told her it was no ordinary vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the sunlight, the black paint had a deep, luminous sheen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The color and finish whispered of hidden luxury.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The tires and rims were high-end, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was clearly a custom, modified car for the ultra-wealthy, easily worth as much as a Bugatti or Lamborghini.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did some big shot just arrive?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To Arabella&amp;#39;s surprise, the man who got out looked anything but a big shot. He was dressed shabbily, with dark circles under his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He wasn&amp;#39;t much older than her, maybe four or five years, but he was unshaven and seemed generally worn out. Despite his disheveled appearance, his eyes were sharp and alert.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They landed on Arabella, and a flicker of surprise passed through them. &amp;quot;You must be Arabella, right?&amp;quot; he asked.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 3 Dislocating the Scumbag&amp;#39;s Arm&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He continued, &amp;quot;You and Mom... You really look like twins.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His family said they&amp;#39;d send someone to pick up Arabella today. He&amp;#39;d just finished a case and was on leave, so he offered to swing by and get her. That way, the family could just wait and welcome them both home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He thought he might need an introduction at the Macdonald Villa. But one look at Arabella, and he knew.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing the man&amp;#39;s face, which bore a clear resemblance to her own, Arabella raised an eyebrow. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re... my brother?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred Hamilton quickly introduced himself, &amp;quot;Yes. I&amp;#39;m Alfred Hamilton, your third brother.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only then did Alfred notice Arabella&amp;#39;s odd look. He glanced down and remembered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Right. I&amp;#39;ve been on a stakeout for that drug lord for days. Barely slept, and haven&amp;#39;t changed clothes. I just came straight here. Too tired on the drive to even think about buying a new suit.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry, I came in a rush. Forgot to change...&amp;quot; Alfred was cold and indifferent in his unit, an unyielding leader. But here, in front of his little sister, he felt uncharacteristically embarrassed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella was about to say it was fine when Harper&amp;#39;s voice piped up from behind them. &amp;quot;Where did this beggar come from? Security! How did you just let someone wander in?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The villa&amp;#39;s security guard hurried over. &amp;quot;Ms. Macdonald, he said he was here to pick up Arabella. So I let him through.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Hearing this, Harper turned to Arabella with feigned surprise. &amp;quot;Oh... Arabella, I&amp;#39;m so sorry. I didn&amp;#39;t know this was your family. Please don&amp;#39;t mind what I just said.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella looked at her coldly. &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re sorry, then shut up. No one wants to hear you talk.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With that, she walked past Harper, opened the passenger door of Alfred&amp;#39;s car, and tossed her backpack inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dylan had followed them out, eager to get back at her for the water incident.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing Alfred&amp;#39;s car with no visible brand logo, he sneered, &amp;quot;Well, well. I&amp;#39;ve never seen a car without a badge. Did your family assemble this themselves in the backyard?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred, still leaning tiredly against the car, replied calmly, &amp;quot;Actually, yes. We did.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were special forces. Every vehicle was heavily modified. His, in particular, had been designed by their fifth brother, Daniel Hamilton.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Daniel was still a PhD student but was already a weaponry design expert earmarked by the Defense Department. The weapons and vehicles he designed, once modified, were exceptionally powerful and had unmatched performance—they could even save your life in a crisis. So this car&amp;#39;s value far exceeded any luxury vehicle on the market, and its modification cost alone rivaled a supercar&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dylan, of course, missed the meaning entirely. He kept mocking Arabella. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m shocked your family even has a car. But with no logo... maybe it&amp;#39;s stolen?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harper played along, pretending to be concerned. &amp;quot;Arabella, you should be careful. What if you accidentally become an accessory? You could get in serious legal trouble.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella was rolling her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their nonsense inside was bad enough. Now they&amp;#39;re outside, taunting my family?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She&amp;#39;d had enough.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But before she could speak, Alfred&amp;#39;s expression darkened. He walked straight toward them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred was over six feet tall. Standing in front of Dylan, he seemed like a giant. He clapped a heavy hand on Dylan&amp;#39;s shoulder and said, &amp;quot;Kid, you can eat whatever you want, but you can&amp;#39;t say whatever you want. Did no one ever teach you that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Years of running devil training for his team and interrogating prisoners had earned Alfred a nickname—Ruthless Death. The look on his face now made Dylan feel like he might wet himself.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d never seen anyone with such a terrifying presence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I... I was just... speculating...&amp;quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred snorted, &amp;quot;Speculating? This country may have free speech, but you&amp;#39;re legally responsible for every word you say. If your parents didn&amp;#39;t teach you, I can.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As he spoke, the hand on Dylan&amp;#39;s shoulder tightened slightly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There was a sickening crack. Dylan&amp;#39;s shoulder was dislocated in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dylan felt like his arm had vanished. Excruciating pain made him shriek. &amp;quot;Ah! Okay! I won&amp;#39;t! Let me go!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only then did Alfred, his face still cold, sharply pull the arm back into place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dylan was now pale and speechless with fear. But Harper still hadn&amp;#39;t understood what was going on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred glanced sideways at Harper. She shuddered violently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes are terrifying.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Little girl,&amp;quot; Alfred said, his voice low. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t hit women. I&amp;#39;ll let you off today. Next time I see you, keep your mouth clean. I don&amp;#39;t like anyone cursing my family.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Talking about my sister getting in serious legal trouble?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re asking for it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harper could only nod, thoroughly cowed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred finally released the coercion. He turned back to Arabella with a warm smile. &amp;quot;Arabella, let&amp;#39;s go.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella looked at his smiling face. It was hard to believe this was the same intimidating man from moments ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred is definitely not ordinary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But since he has handled Dylan and Harper, I should play the sweet little sister.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay, Alfred.&amp;quot; She climbed into the passenger seat with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred didn&amp;#39;t think much of it. He got in the driver&amp;#39;s side, buckled up, and drove away from the Macdonald Villa.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harper and Dylan were left behind, watching the car disappear, their hearts still pounding.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What was that guy?&amp;quot; Dylan muttered, moving his now-functional arm, the fear lingering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Harper shook her head. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. But his license plate... I think it was a Doranor City plate. And... it looked like a government plate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s so strange. He looked so scruffy. How could he be driving a Doranor City government vehicle?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You must have seen wrong.&amp;quot; Dylan shook his head. He&amp;#39;d been too scared to notice details, but his gut said she was mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella&amp;#39;s birth family is supposedly full of unemployed drifters. How could they afford a Doranor City plate? Only locals can get those.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Getting residency in Doranor City isn&amp;#39;t for ordinary people. You are either born into wealth or married into it. The Macdonald family is rich, but even they have out-of-town plates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella&amp;#39;s family has to be dirt poor. There is no way they are Doranor City locals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So she must have been seeing things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 4 Is This for Real?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the car, Alfred, still feeling a bit awkward, said, &amp;quot;Sorry about that, Arabella. I came in such a hurry. I forgot to change. I know I&amp;#39;m a mess. Didn&amp;#39;t mean to make you the subject of gossip.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;d never cared about his appearance before. But he couldn&amp;#39;t embarrass Arabella like that again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella gave an understanding shake of her head. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s fine. Clothes should be comfortable, that&amp;#39;s all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred immediately felt more fond of her.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Noticing she only had the backpack, he asked, &amp;quot;Arabella, is that all your luggage? Just the one bag?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella nodded, her tone cool. &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t want a single thing from the Macdonald family.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred was highly observant. He caught the edge in her voice, and his eyes turned cold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Did that family make her unhappy?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then he said gently, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s okay. Once we&amp;#39;re home, I&amp;#39;ll buy you anything you want.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella offered a warm smile. &amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever my family&amp;#39;s real situation is, at least Alfred seems genuinely kind.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella noticed the route Alfred was taking. She couldn&amp;#39;t help asking, &amp;quot;Alfred, isn&amp;#39;t this the road to Oceanview Peak?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oceanview Peak was where Doranor City&amp;#39;s wealthiest, most powerful, and most prestigious families lived.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Peak was enormous, covering almost the entire Sunspire District. Driving up the winding road, they passed massive villa clusters and luxurious estates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Macdonald family, new to the city, had made it their mission to learn that Doranor City&amp;#39;s ten oldest, most influential families were all clustered here in the Sunspire District.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The problem was that the roads up the mountain had security checkpoints. Unless you were a resident or had an invitation from one, you couldn&amp;#39;t enter Oceanview Peak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yet their car only paused briefly at a checkpoint. The license plate was scanned, and the gate lifted immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred answered her question casually, &amp;quot;Yeah. Mom and Dad are waiting for us at home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella&amp;#39;s eyebrows shot up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My home is on Oceanview Peak?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I am starting to doubt Carter&amp;#39;s investigative skills.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aren&amp;#39;t my parents and brothers supposed to be unemployed drifters?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;How could Carter not even know where they live?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carter was notoriously incompetent. That was why Arabella had had to manage the company from the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He probably just heard &amp;#39;unemployed&amp;#39; and made up the rest in his head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well, this is good. If my family is well-off, I won&amp;#39;t have to worry about supporting them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They passed several impressive villas. She expected the car to stop, but it didn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then she saw the bigger villas. Okay, so they&amp;#39;re a bit wealthier than I thought.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred drove for another ten minutes. They left the villa zone and entered the sprawling estate area. Arabella narrowed her eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright. My new family isn&amp;#39;t just wealthy. They&amp;#39;re seriously wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just as that thought settled, the car kept going.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It finally reached the very summit of the peak.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Oceanview Peak got its name because this top road was completely unobstructed, with clear ocean views on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And at the end of this road stood only one estate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a landmark visible from downtown Doranor City—Cloudrise Manor.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was iconic because it sat at the city&amp;#39;s highest point. From downtown, you could see this castle-like structure against the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was said to have been personally overseen by Howard Martin, the world&amp;#39;s top architect. It was an extremely luxurious, hyper-modern landmark. From this castle, you could see the sunrise over the ocean in the morning and the most stunning sunset in the evening—hence the name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The owner was shrouded in mystery. Rumors said even Doranor City&amp;#39;s top ten families couldn&amp;#39;t compare. No one knew who owned Cloudrise Manor, only that its owner was fabulously wealthy, with investments in every industry, but no family company of their own. Everything was handled by a team of top-tier butlers and stewards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No one had ever seen the owner. Their family&amp;#39;s true identity was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella assumed Alfred was just driving her up to see the view. She expected they&amp;#39;d pass by and head down to the other side of the mountain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Instead, Alfred turned the car through the gates into the museum-like estate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Under the sun, water danced in the central fountain, catching the light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sculpture at its center was a modern masterpiece, clearly worth a fortune.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even Arabella, accustomed to valuables and authenticity, knew it was top-tier.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred brought the car to a smooth stop right before the castle&amp;#39;s grand entrance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before Arabella could process it, Alfred got out and walked around to open her door like a gentleman. &amp;quot;Arabella, welcome home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As he spoke, two lines of more than twenty servants flanking the red carpet at the entrance bowed in unison. &amp;quot;Welcome home, Ms. Hamilton!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a second, Arabella thought she&amp;#39;d walked onto a movie set.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Alfred... this... is my home?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this for real?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even with ample funds in her own accounts and plenty of experience with grand settings and important people, Arabella was stunned.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She had prepared herself for a run-down house, unemployed parents and brothers, and the responsibility of supporting them all.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she never expected a complete 180-degree turn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My family is the legendary, mysterious top-tier wealthy family of Doranor City?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Chapter 5 What if We Scared Her?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing Arabella&amp;#39;s surprised expression, Alfred gave an indulgent smile. &amp;quot;Yes, this is your home. Come on in. Mom and Dad are waiting.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella took a steadying breath and got out of the car. Looking at the extravagant red carpet at her feet, she stepped onto it a bit awkwardly. &amp;quot;This is... quite a welcome.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred smiled, &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s only right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After all the hardship she has endured for so many years, her first homecoming deserves to be special.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As they spoke, two figures rushed out from behind the tall doors at the end of the carpet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is that Arabella?&amp;quot; Came an excited, melodic female voice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella looked up to see a middle-aged woman in a simple but elegant dress approaching. She was beautiful and graceful.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though past forty, she was impeccably maintained, radiating a star-like, gentle charm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beside her was a distinguished-looking middle-aged man, tall and handsome, bearing a strong resemblance to Alfred.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella knew instantly—these were her parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seeing them, the perfect image of an aristocratic couple, her image of &amp;quot;unemployed drifters&amp;quot; completely vanished.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Carter, could you be any more incompetent?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is this what &amp;#39;unemployed drifter&amp;#39; looks like?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By now, Florence Hamilton had reached Arabella. She took Arabella&amp;#39;s hands in hers, her eyes instantly welling up. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s true. This is my daughter. Jonathan, look how much she resembles me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Hamilton studied Arabella&amp;#39;s face, so similar to Florence&amp;#39;s, and nodded in wonder. &amp;quot;Yes. The likeness is remarkable.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Florence had been an internationally renowned star in her day, known for her extraordinary beauty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At first, they&amp;#39;d never doubted Naomi Hamilton was their biological child.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But after puberty, as Naomi grew to look less and less like either Florence or Jonathan, whispers began. They, too, started to sense something was off.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They had just begun looking into it when the Macdonald family discovered the mix-up. The police compared their DNA with Arabella&amp;#39;s, confirming she was their biological daughter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They&amp;#39;d planned to run another test after she arrived. But now, seeing her, it seemed unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella was the spitting image of a young Florence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Without a trace of makeup, she was stunningly beautiful in a pure, natural way.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella was equally surprised by how much she looked like her mother.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No wonder Freya and I were never close. I was cute as a child and grew up looking nothing like her. She probably suspected I wasn&amp;#39;t hers all along.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Once that suspicion took root, Arabella investigated and found out the truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seemed this time, she had truly found her birth parents.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dad, Mom, it&amp;#39;s windy out here. Let&amp;#39;s go inside,&amp;quot; Alfred suggested gently.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a seaside estate, the ocean breeze was strong. He didn&amp;#39;t want Florence catching a chill.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Florence nodded eagerly. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re right! I was so excited I forgot. Come inside, dear.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Still holding Arabella&amp;#39;s hand, she led her through the doors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Feeling Florence&amp;#39;s soft, warm hand, Arabella felt an unexpected wave of warmth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Growing up despised by Freya, she&amp;#39;d rarely experienced a mother&amp;#39;s care and affection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now she realized a mother&amp;#39;s touch could feel so comforting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The group moved inside.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They passed through an entrance hall that felt more like an art gallery. The walls were lined with paintings, each flanked by ceramic or sculptural pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Passing one particular ceramic artwork, Arabella paused.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This piece... looks familiar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Noticing Arabella&amp;#39;s gaze, Florence said, &amp;quot;Arabella, do you like it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella hesitated, then nodded awkwardly.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Like it? Well, I liked it enough when I made it. Or I wouldn&amp;#39;t make it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But she made so many pieces each month, bundling them off to her studio assistant to sell. This one had taken her, at most, three hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To think it ended up in my own parents&amp;#39; home... What a coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you like it, we can move it to your room later,&amp;quot; Florence offered. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a top work by a mysterious new artist. I bought it at a charity auction last month for eight million dollars. Not terribly expensive, but wonderfully creative.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arabella&amp;#39;s mouth twitched.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eight million dollars... &amp;#39;Not terribly expensive&amp;#39;?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even as one of Meridian District&amp;#39;s top three merchants, the Macdonald family won&amp;#39;t casually spend eight million dollars on such a small piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And it is just something I threw together.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just how wealthy is my family?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They arrived in the grand living room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A dozen servants stood in two lines.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One group held trays with various beverages—different types of coffee and juices. The other held trays of assorted pastries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Florence guided Arabella past them, her voice soft. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s your first day home, sweetheart. I didn&amp;#39;t know what you&amp;#39;d like to drink, so I had them prepare every type of coffee and juice. And these pastries are from the best patisserie in Doranor City. I got one of each flavor for you to try.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Under Florence&amp;#39;s expectant gaze, Arabella felt obliged to choose. She picked a hand-ground coffee and two pastries.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She said, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like things too sweet. The matcha and osmanthus flavors look just right.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Florence was delighted. &amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t believe it! Even your tastes are like mine.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It really is family. How did I not notice how different Naomi&amp;#39;s preferences were?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The chosen servants presented the items, and the others dispersed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alfred said, &amp;quot;Mom, Dad, I&amp;#39;m going to go change.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jonathan looked at his disheveled state and sighed, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re the leader of INTERPOL&amp;#39;s Special Unit A now. What sort of case is this that has you personally leading the team to look like this? Had I known you were in this state, I wouldn&amp;#39;t have let you pick up Arabella. What if we scared her?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;At his words, Alfred looked awkward. &amp;quot;This was an international drug lord bust. It wasn&amp;#39;t just me, even the...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The space here is limited for chapters.

I want to share a deck i've been brewing for a couple months. This was originally a selesnya deck with \\[\\[Lae'zel, Vlaakith's Champion\\]\\] and \\[\\[Master Chef\\]\\]. \n\nThis deck has a heavy emphasis on getting counters on my creatures as they enter (\\[\\[Yuna, Grand Summoner\\]\\], \\[\\[Arwen, Weaver of Hope\\]\\], \\[\\[Warden of the Grove\\]\\], etc) and when they enter (\\[\\[Denry Kiln, Editor in Chief\\]\\], \\[\\[Railway Brawler\\]\\]). \n\nI run a decent amount of counter increasers and 3 counter doubler replacement effect cards. Also several cards that double counters upon attacking.\n\nThere's a lot of typical counter synergy cards in here, but I think it's still a pretty unique brew. \n\nThe main goal is to ramp on turn 1 and/or turn 2, so I can get Yuna out on turn 3 and then start playing threats on turn 4. Sometimes I continue to set up for 1 or 2 more turns though and then drop a big threat like \\[\\[Neverwinter Hydra\\]\\]. \n\nOverall the deck could probably use some improvement, but it feels good to play for the most part in my pod.

I want to share a deck i&amp;#39;ve been brewing for a couple months. This was originally a selesnya deck with [[Lae&amp;#39;zel, Vlaakith&amp;#39;s Champion]] and [[Master Chef]]. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This deck has a heavy emphasis on getting counters on my creatures as they enter ([[Yuna, Grand Summoner]], [[Arwen, Weaver of Hope]], [[Warden of the Grove]], etc) and when they enter ([[Denry Kiln, Editor in Chief]], [[Railway Brawler]]). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I run a decent amount of counter increasers and 3 counter doubler replacement effect cards. Also several cards that double counters upon attacking.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a lot of typical counter synergy cards in here, but I think it&amp;#39;s still a pretty unique brew. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The main goal is to ramp on turn 1 and/or turn 2, so I can get Yuna out on turn 3 and then start playing threats on turn 4. Sometimes I continue to set up for 1 or 2 more turns though and then drop a big threat like [[Neverwinter Hydra]]. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall the deck could probably use some improvement, but it feels good to play for the most part in my pod. I am trying to pay slightly more attention to the mana curve, so any assistance with that would be appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think of this deck.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "The rain in Jinyang was a language I understood better than spoken words, a dialect of despair I’d become fluent in. It didn’t fall with the clean, crisp rhythm of my Southern Water Tribe home, a sight that promised renewal, but as a persistent, weary liquid shroud over a city-state choking on the haze of countless charcoal fires and pottery kilns, a constant slick through the tiered rooftops with a treacherous sheen of grime. From my perch atop a crumbling pagoda, Jinyang sprawled below, a festering wound. The gleaming, tallow-lamp-lit chambers of the elite on the upper levels were distant, mocking stars. Down here, in the city’s guts, was a labyrinth of rust, poverty, and perpetual shadow. I’d chosen this place as my residence because of this rot.\n\nJinyang was a lynchpin. Its kilns fired the ceramics that held the Earth Kingdom’s grain, its clay formed the tiles that roofed its palaces. Its economic stability was the bedrock of the entire eastern seaboard. If Jinyang crumbled, the tremors would crack the foundations of the nation. The world showed that Avatar Visha, my predecessor, had been too passive, an Air Nomad lost in meditation while the world’s problems festered. I, a deaf girl was a bad omen, a broken vessel for Raava. Jinyang would be where I forge a new legacy for the Avatar, one of action and unyielding control.\n\nBao-Bao shivered beside me. His panda-white fur was matted down by the drizzle, and his raccoon-striped tail was tucked so tightly between his legs it practically vanished. He chittered and his sharp ears, a gift I envied, swiveled, catching the entire song of the night that was denied to me. He was my ears, my partner, my inseparable shadow. The memory of our meeting was as vivid as the grime on these walls. Years ago, a much lonelier Avatar, newly arrived in this behemoth of a city-state, had her food lifted by a tiny blur. The target had been a still-warm honey-cake, its sweet aroma a fleeting comfort. I gave chase, more amused than angry. The tiny thief scrambled up a tall pagoda, a monument to his audacity, only to freeze in terror at the top. The sight of his petrified form struck a chord deep within me. I gently brought him down with a cushion of air. Instead of reclaiming my belongings, I offered him a piece of the cake. We were two lonely souls finding solace in each other’s silence.\n\nNow I drew damp air to me, pulling its scents apart: the sharp sting of coal smoke, the savory steam of spiced turtle-duck broth from a cart three streets over, the sour, gut-turning stench of wet garbage. And beneath it all, something coppery. I tapped Bao-Bao and signed, my movements sharp in the gloom. \"Down.\" He gave me a look that eloquently communicated his disdain for the plan. He scampered down the nearest bamboo gutter with the practiced ease of a career criminal. I followed, my descent muffled by a cushion of air that displaced the raindrops around me.\n\nThe terrain was cramped. Councilman Gak, whose lips I’d read countless times spewing practiced platitudes about prosperity now lay sprawled in a puddle of rainwater and his own blood, his fine silk robes soaked a darker shade of crimson. I knelt, planting my bare feet on the cold stone. Closing my eyes, I let the city’s pulse travel up through me. The vibrations painted a grim, three-dimensional picture in my mind. No secondary impacts against the walls. Just the single, brutal, crushing echo of his sternum caving in. The killer was immensely strong, but the attack was almost surgical. An earthbender, perhaps? But the wound wasn't consistent with a rock projectile. A firebender? No scorch marks. Water? I drew a small sphere of the water from the puddle. I separated the elements within it: water, blood. And a fine, dark powder. Ash.\n\nScrawled on the wall above him in a meticulous paste of ash and blood was a symbol: a perfect circle, with a single, sharp flame inside. A crowd was gathering, their vibrations a messy chorus, and their faces filled with fear and curiosity. One vibration and smell stood out: a frantic, sweaty thrum of pure terror. Before I could pinpoint it, it was gone, swallowed by the growing mob. Heavy footsteps echoed from the mouth of the alley. Goro. The last honest city guard, and my only human friend. “Spirits damn it all, Zihuan.” He ran a hand over his weary, unshaven face. “Another one. First Kail the merchant, now this sack of hot air. The council's going to have my hide.” He gestured to me. “What do you got, kid?”\n\n\"No struggle. The killer's strong. Precise. The symbol's identical to the one on Kail.\" Goro translated for the nervous recruits behind him. “She says our Ashen Ripper's a meticulous son of a bitch with a real flair for the dramatic. Any of you useless bastards got a clue what this symbol means?” They shook their heads. Behind them, a lanky man with the scent of old papyrus and fear clinging to him, looked like he was about to be sick. He turned and hurried away, melting back into the crowd. Interesting. I took a deep breath, memorizing his specific scent. “Of course not,” Goro sighed. He turned back to me. “And you, BB,” he said, nodding to Bao-Bao, who was attempting a very subtle heist on a dropped coin purse. “Keep your sticky paws to yourself for once.”\n\nBao-Bao chittered indignantly, but his little hand had already shot out and snatched a small piece of papyrus from Gak and a silver ring from his finger. Before I could even form the sign for ‘stop’, he was tucking them away. I almost smiled. I followed the scent of the fearful man. It was a trail of pure panic straight to the city archives. The man was a trembling leaf when we found him, trying to bar the door. “I don’t know anything,” he stammered, his heart hammering a frantic rhythm I could feel through the floorboards. “My friend here can tell when you’re lying,” Goro growled, leaning his considerable bulk against the door. “I suggest you tell us what you know before we gets creative.” The old man cracked. “It’s an old zealot’s mark,” he whispered. “The ‘Flame of Rectitude.’ Centuries old. A symbol for purification by fire.” A Fire Nation symbol. So a firebender might be the killer?\n\nOur next visit was to the highest tier of the city. Councilman Bohai’s chamber was an exercise in opulent power, all jade and carved rosewood. From his balcony, you couldn’t smell the rot from below. Bohai himself was as polished and handsome as his chamber. “Avatar Zihuan,” he said. “I was so terribly saddened to hear about Gak.” I watched his mouth, my feet planted firmly, letting my seismic sense seep into the marble. His heartbeat was as steady as a master drummer’s. But I felt a faint, discordant tremor in Goro’s pulse. \"You two were opponents. His death benefits you.\" Goro translated. “She says, tough break about your buddy. Guess that means you’re top dog now, you lucky son of a bitch.\" Bohai’s smile didn’t falter, but I felt a flicker of tension in his jaw. He addressed Goro, speaking slowly as if I were a dim-witted child. “Politics is a contentious business. But murder? That’s chaos. And chaos is bad for everyone.” His heart remained steady. Damn him. He was either innocent or possessed a level of control that bordered on unnatural.\n\n'My seismic sense isn't picking up on a lie, Goro. Ask him if he knows anyone who'd want both a merchant and a Councilman dead?' Before Goro could translate, Bohai responded smoothly, “The list of people with grievances in Jinyang's longer than the Great Wall.” He understood sign language. The whole time. He was watching my hands, gathering information I never intended for him. A cold knot formed in my stomach as I thought about all the council meetings I went to crying for change in Jinyang it. They didn't usually go perfectly. But I could control the council. I could control Jinyang. I could control everything.\n\nAs we stepped from Bohai’s estate back into the weeping grey of the city, a figure detached itself from the shadows of a nearby archway. His hands were calloused from a lifetime of hard labor. His dark hair was tied in a simple, unadorned top-knot, the kind common among the working class. But it looked wrong. As if it were recently cut, not grown into the style. “Avatar,” he said. “I'm Mr. Bohai's assistant. The merchant who was killed, Kail, he got into some legal trouble.” \"How do you know anything about this?\" “I help out in the courts and a man like Kail casts a long shadow, Avatar. Down where I live, his shadow touches everyone. You learn to connect the dots, just to survive.” I planted my feet firmly on the slick cobblestones, letting my seismic sense drink him in. His pulse was a slow, steady drumbeat against the earth. Honest. \"Thank you. Your name?\" “Jinsha. Fei's Kail’s enforcer. You’ll usually find him drowning his conscience at The Bottom Feeder.” Before I could ask another question, he gave a respectful bow and melted back into the alleyway.\n\nThe Bottom Feeder was aptly named. The air was thick with stale ale, cheap perfume, and desperation. The beautiful bartender named Shira said, “Come to finally pay your tab, Goro? Or just to run it up some more before you lose a finger?” Goro’s face flushed. I felt his heart skip a beat. “We’re looking for Fei,” Goro growled. “Never heard of him.” The woman’s heart became a jackhammer of deceit. Simultaneously, I felt the weight of large figures rising from a corner table. \"Your heart says you're lying,\" I signed, my gaze fixed on her. \"And your friends are about to make a mistake.\" A hulking waterbender whipped a tendril of murky water. Goro, moving with surprising grace for a man his size, kicked up his saber and blocked it. A fireball came my way until I caught it in a vortex and redirected it. Bao-Bao scurried up a support pillar and was gleefully dropping eggs onto the brawlers' heads before launching himself onto their backs, a furious menace.\n\nI swept my leg, sending a crescent of air that knocked the firebender off his feet. Goro had the waterbender in a chokehold, his saber a cold threat against their neck. The fight was over in a minute. I stood amidst the groaning men, not a bead of sweat on my brow. Shira’s eyes went wide with fear. \"Let’s try this again.\" I signed, my fingers moving deliberately, each gesture a command. \"Fine. You're very...convincing,\" she stammered, her voice rough. \"He's over there.\" Fei, sweating in a corner booth, sang like a canary. \"Kail had the screws to people with some real dough. Had shit on half the politicians in the state.\" That meant it would include Gak and Bohai. The pieces clicked into a ugly picture. Bohai wasn’t just a political rival; he was a blackmail victim. The papyrus Bao-Bao had lifted from Gak's body confirmed it. It was a payment schedule to Kail.\n\nThat night, we paid Bohai’s chambers another visit. We scaled the building as I bent the air around us as a muffle. Inside, Bao-Bao went to work, pocketing a polished silver inkwell. I felt a faint vibration from a strongbox hidden behind a tapestry. I placed my palm against the cold iron. I sensed the moisture inside the latching mechanism: the dampness in the greased tumblers. I turned the water to ice, expanding it violently. The latch snapped. Bao-Bao scurried through the gap and returned a moment later with a leather-bound ledger. Then I felt a skittering tremor crawling up the stone wall from the outside. It was the distinct signature of a spider-gecko, but heavier. Before I could process anything, a section of the wall directly beside me exploded as a concussive blast of dust and razor-sharp shrapnel.\n\nThrough the cloud, an earthen dagger, perfectly formed and honed to a wicked point, shot forth. I twisted, a reflexive gasp of air escaping my lips, but it was too fast. It missed my ribs by a hair's breadth but tore through my thick parka and the flesh beneath, a searing line of pain that stole my breath and left me staggering. A figure stepped through what used to be the wall. With a flick of his wrist, the sand solidified back into an stone behind him. He was clad in worn desert garb, his face a mask of detached, almost cheerful professionalism. “The Avatar herself. And her...oversized rat. Your investigation has become inconvenient.” This was Kobo. A legendary mercenary and, more importantly, Bohai’s personal enforcer. A cold dread, colder than any Southern Tribe winter, washed over me.\n\n“Don’t worry.” Kobo continued, taking a step forward. For a hitman, the guy couldn't shut up. His words were a stream designed to force me to focus on his lips, to split my attention from his lethal hands. I didn’t give him the satisfaction of a reaction. My gaze locked on his, a challenge. \"No hard feelings then,\" he chirped, \"I would hate for you to come after me in your next life!\" He lunged and I answered with an explosive blast of fire from my fist. He propelled himself off the floor with a earthbending push, landing on the ceiling. He began to crawl across it like an insect, and from that inverted position, his lips were an unreadable, upside-down blur. His earthen dagger flew from his hand in a ricocheting arc of death. I became a leaf in the wind, twisting and propelling myself with sharp gusts of air, a constant buffer between me and the death that passed my ear.\n\n“You’re qui...but ca…you breathe?” He slammed his hands together. The air grew thick and viscous, swirling with dust and sand pulled from the mortar of the building. It was a blinding, choking storm contained within the chamber. The chaotic swirl of particles rendered my seismic sense a useless, fuzzy cacophony. Bohai must have told him after I accidentally revealed my abilities to him. At the same time, the walls began to constrict. My lungs burned and I summoned moisture around my eyes to clear them. Kobo was everywhere at once, a phantom within his own storm. I felt faint, skittering tremors as he melted through the floor and ceiling as if they were sand, his dagger a constant in the chaos.\n\nI launched fireballs at vibrations that might have been him, but it was like shooting at ghosts. He turned a patch of the floor beneath me to shifting sand, and reacting on instinct, I blasted a cushion of air beneath my feet to stay aloft just as the dagger sliced through the storm towards my head. In that instant, Bao-Bao angled the inkwell. For a split second, it caught a stray glimmer of lamplight through the dust, flashing a blinding pinpoint of light directly into Kobo’s eyes. He flinched. It was barely a tremor, but it was enough. In that same motion, Bao-Bao became a furry missile of defiance, tackling the spinning dagger mid-air and furiously hurling it back into the swirling chaos. Kobo’s eyes widened at the sheer audacity of the raccoon-panda. He twisted away, but the blade was too fast. It caught his cheek, opening a deep, bloody gash. That was the opening.\n\nI reached for the overwhelming power of the Avatar State. I felt a flicker of cosmic energy, a connection to something vast. But my grip on my own fear, on my desperate need to dominate this fight, to force a victory, was too tight. The connection sputtered and died, leaving me vulnerable. The irony was vicious; my desperate need for control, a direct rebellion against Visha's passiveness, was the very thing holding me back from my true power.\n\n\"Nowhere to run.\" Kobo ragefully brought his fists down and with them, a massive section of the ceiling. I stomped, raising a desperate shield of earth and air above us. The chamber had become a death trap. We were outmatched. I gathered a vortex of compressed elements around my fist. Bao-Bao saw what I was doing and latched onto my back, his claws digging into my parka so hard I could barely feel my own pulse. I punched a cannonball through the wall, blowing a ragged hole out into the rainy night. Without a second thought, we leapt. For the first time since Kobo'd appeared, I could finally breathe.\n\nFor a moment, I thought I could be like Laghima and fly. I soon came to understand that wasn't the reality. The fall was a terrifying, screaming eternity. Bao-Bao frantically tapped my shoulder and I twisted to see a volley of spiked earth hurling towards us. I unleashed a torrent of dragon’s fire, incinerating them mid-air, then flash-froze a cloud to block his pursuit. We were plummeting through Jinyang's tiers, a dizzying descent. I had to get control. I used airbending to steer our plummet, kicking off walls to change direction. Branches like skeletal fingers clawed at us as the ground rushed up. At the last possible second, I summoned a violent updraft, a desperate cushion against the inevitable. We hit the ground hard.\n\nThe impact was a jarring crash that shuddered through my entire body, skidding us across the wet, grime-slicked cobblestones. I lay there, gasping, the frantic vibrations of my own ragged breath shaking my chest, the world a dizzying blur of pain. A sickening crunch vibrated up my arm, a sharp, internal crack that I felt through my bones. It was followed by a blinding flash of agony that stole the air from my lungs. My arm was broken, a jagged, unnatural angle beneath the skin, pulsating with every frantic beat of my heart. I brought my other hand to it, my fingers tracing the sharp line of shattered bone. The rain was a healing balm falling from the sky. I drew it to me, cupping the water over the injury, willing my skin to glow with the soft, blue light of healing, a skill I should've mastered as a child. But there was nothing. No glow, no soothing energy. Just cold water on a broken limb. Frustration, hot and bitter as kiln smoke, rose in my throat as tears stained my eyes. I was broken.\n\nThe grim finality of my thoughts was punctuated by a wet heaving I felt through my cloak. Bao-Bao, uncurling from my neck, promptly threw up a half-digested steamed bun onto the cobblestones beside my head. We were battered, broken, and disgusted, but alive. We had to disappear into the city's gut; so we scrambled to Goro’s home that smelled of medicinal herbs and savory broth. A young girl with her father’s kind eyes lay on a cot. Oana. Her lungs were failing, a casualty of the city’s polluted air. Healing couldn't purify lungs choked by years of inhaling kiln-ash, a sickness woven into the very fabric of the city. It was a wound I couldn't control.\n\n“So Bohai sent Kobo to kill you,” Goro summarized. “He has to be our killer.” It felt too simple. While he splinted my arm, I studied the ledger. The coded document Bao-Bao'd stolen was only a list of blackmail payments. The ledger detailed a massive, illegal land deal involving the city’s richest clay deposits: land that'd been seized from working-class families. The pollution from the mines was a direct result of their greed. The politicians, including Gak and Bohai, got rich. The blackmailers, like Kail, got paid to stay quiet and benefit from the corruption. One family of Fire Nation immigrants had lost more than most. Disgraced and penniless, they killed themselves, their bodies found by their son named Jinsha. Kobo was the enforcer who'd personally evicted them. My blood ran cold. The final name on the blackmailer’s list was a magistrate named Kyo, the one who’d stamped the fraudulent deal. We had to move.\n\nBao-Bao and I propelled forward as I created jets of fire from my feet, skating over the wet cobblestones on a ramp of ice, leaping between rooftops with gusts of air, propelling myself up walls with pillars of earth. It was a frantic, desperate race against a clock. We burst into Kyo’s home to find him dying, the Flame of Rectitude painted above him. As he took his last, ragged breaths I saw him: a far away figure leaping into the night. For a split second, a flare of blue fire illuminated his escape. The Earth Kingdom top-knot was a lie. He’d cut his hair, the Fire Nation sign of ultimate dishonor. It all crashed into place with the force of a tidal wave. Jinsha was the Ashen Ripper.\n\nWatching Kyo die, my heightened senses made it a visceral nightmare. I didn't just see it; I felt the life stutter and cease in his chest through the floorboards, a final, fading tremor in the song of the earth. I saw the light drain from his eyes, and through the charged air, I could smell the faint charred scent of flesh. It broke something inside me. The belief that I could fix this rotten system piece by piece, felt like a fool’s dream. My path had led to a dead body at my feet. The investigation was over. The hunt was on.\n\nIgnoring the cacophony of the city, I stretched out my senses, my mind a predator’s. I focused on the lingering heat of Jinsha’s fire, moving through Jinyang with a predatory purpose. An urchin darted through the crowd during our pursuit and pressed a note into Goro’s hand. I watched the color drain from his face as his eyes scanned the parchment. His hand beginning to tremble so violently I could feel the frantic vibration through the floorboards. His heart rate, a steady drumbeat even in chaos, spiked into a frantic rhythm. “That was one of my informants. Heard a rumor about an illegal shipment down at the docks. Might be…connected.” Goro's heart screamed lie. But this was Goro. Everything was under control. I let him lead me to the docks where the air thick with the smell of damp wood and something else...a faint scent of whale oil.\n\n\"I'm sorry, kid.\" The docks erupted in a ball of fire. I shoved Goro forward with all my might and threw myself backward, erecting a hasty wall of earth just as the force of the blast threw me like a doll. I slammed into a brick wall, my broken arm screaming in protest. Through the pressure that threatened to pop my eyes from my skull, I saw Goro, safe. “He had me,” Goro choked out, collapsing beside me. “Bohai. He… he owned my gambling debts. The money for Oana’s medicine… I lost it, Zihuan. I lost it all. Bohai said…lead you here…and Oana would get the best medicine. My debt would be gone. If I didn’t… he’d have me thrown in a cell to rot, and Oana would.” Bao-Bao and I raced to Bohai estate, abandoning Goro; but even as my feet pounded the slick stone, I was already there.\n\nI \"watched\" through the stone and felt two distinct vibrations clashing in a frantic, deadly dance. One was Kobo's: fluid, evasive, a spider-like skittering across the marble floors. The other was a focused, explosive power, each footfall a concussive blast of energy. I felt heat and Kobo’s defenses melt into slag. I felt a brutal impact as Kobo’s vibration was snuffed out, and then a single, powerful tremor moving away, carrying another one along with it. We found Kobo crumpled outside Bohai’s estate, his body broken. He was alive, barely. I knelt beside him. Kobo coughed out, “Blue fire…a demon…” he said, his eyes wide with a terror that transcended pain. “He took him… said he was going to cleanse him in fire.” Jinsha’s lair had to be somewhere connected fire and the source of the corruption...the mines. Bao-Bao and I ventured alone. I couldn't trust Goro. I had this under control.\n\nDeep beneath the city, where the very earth was stripped away for profit, Jinsha'd carved out his sanctuary of vengeance. The entrance was led deep into the belly of Jinyang. I trailed my good hand along the damp stone wall, my bare feet mapping the floor. I felt a false step connected to a rockfall trap. A tripwire taut as a predator's nerve. With a flick of air or a precise shift of a pebble, I disarmed them, my movements economical and pained. Finally, my seismic sense detected it: a section of wall that felt different. The vibration didn't continue through it; it echoed back, hollow. A concentrated earthbending push with my palm, and a ton of stone slid open, revealing a descent into oppressive heat and darkness.\n\nThe lair was a vast cavern. Rotting wooden scaffolding crisscrossed the cavernous space. The air was thick, tasting of burnt coal. This was a place of obsession. Crude instruments of torture, improvised from mining equipment, were laid out on a stone slab with chilling precision. But the heart of the chamber, illuminated by an eerie blue flame, was a massive map of the city carved into the far wall. Threads of twine connected every victim, every location, every piece of evidence. Kail, Gak, and Kyo had red X's scrawled across them in what I knew was a paste of ash and blood. And at the center of it all, was a faded ink-painting of a smiling man and woman. Jinsha parents. Below it, tied to a chair, was Bohai. He was gagged, bloody, his polished facade stripped away.\n\nHigh on a gantry, silhouetted against the hypnotic dance of his blue flame, stood Jinsha. His head was shaved clean, the mark of a man who'd renounced his nation and his honor, leaving only a core of pure, unadulterated purpose. He turned, and in the oppressive darkness of the mine, his face was a mask of unnerving calm, carved by grief into something resolute. The flames cast jagged, dancing shadows across his features, making his sorrow look alive. “Avatar. What are you going to do? Protect him? He's an architect of misery.” I stepped forward. Bao-Bao’s claws dug into my shoulder, a tense, grounding weight. My fingers moved, shaping the signs in the flickering blue light, each gesture deliberate. \"He is the key. His testimony will bring down the entire corrupt council. He'll face the law.\" Jinsha let out a broken laugh. “The law?” he mouthed with a venom that chilled me more than the damp cavern air. “The law is a tool for men like him, Avatar. A shield they hide behind. I saw no law when Kobo threw my family into the mud. The law's a fairy tale the corrupt tell the poor to keep them from picking up torches.”\n\n\"You're not creating justice, Jinsha. You're tipping the scales toward chaos. Stop before it's too late,\" I signed, my movements growing more desperate, more frantic. The word 'chaos' ignited something in him. With a roar that vibrated through the very rock beneath my feet, he slammed his fist into the stone wall beside him. “Chaos is people hanging themselves because they couldn't bear to watch their children starve! Chaos is a city built on the bones of the poor, where those on high drink imported wine while we drink water poisoned by their mines! I'm not the chaos.” He took a step forward, into the full, haunting glare of his own fire. “I'm the consequence.”\n\nSearing heat shot up through the soles of my bare feet. I looked down in confusion. The stone walkway beneath me wasn't just hot; it was glowing a menacing cherry-red, the very rock liquefying under a focused assault. I was forced into a desperate leap, propelled by a violent blast of air from my heel. I landed hard on a lower platform, a jarring impact that sent a fresh wave of agony screaming up my splinted, broken arm. The world swam in a haze of pain. Before I could even reorient, the darkness around me erupted. Jinsha moved with the fluid grace of a dancer possessed by his own fire. He wasn't just attacking me; he was deconstructing the battlefield. With precise, searing jets of blue fire, he sliced through the thick, rust-eaten support chains of the massive wooden scaffolding that crisscrossed the cavern above. A series of frantic, sharp taps on my left shoulder—Bao-Bao’s signal for a projectile, high and widespread!—was my only warning.\n\nI stomped my foot, raising a crude, desperate shield of stone just as tons of splintering wood and rusted metal crashed down around us. The concussive force was a physical assault that shook me to my core, the vibrations a chaotic scream in my feet. Darkness and dust swallowed everything. My seismic sense was useless. All I could see was the ghost of his blue fire, a phantom dancing in the suffocating black. An explosion to my right threw me against a rock wall, knocking the wind from my lungs. He was igniting hidden pockets of whale oil, the same trick from the docks. You learn to connect the dots, just to survive. He had planned this. He must have known about Goro’s debts and offered Bohai a deal: use Goro to get me out of the way, and he lives. It was all to get to Bohai.\n\nI was forced to become a blur, relying on desperate, kicking air and fire blasts to propel myself through the collapsing maze. My movements were clumsy, ragged, my broken arm a dead weight. I launched a volley of stone discs, each one spun and sharpened to a razor's edge. Jinsha danced between them, melting them to slag mid-air with precise flames until a bolt of concentrated blue fire, hot enough to melt steel, shot at the whimpering, terrified Bohai. “No!” The word was a silent scream in my throat. Bao-Bao was a cannonball, landing on the back of the heavy wooden chair. As I created a shield of rock to intercept the flame—Bao-Bao used his entire body weight, digging his claws in, and heaved. The chair tipped, and Bohai, still bound, crashed to the stone, rolling him out of the path of a blast that vaporized the spot where his head had just been.\n\n“His testimony's meaningless in a world without justice. After I kill him, I'll burn my way through the entire council.” Frustration boiled in my gut. I abandoned ranged attacks for raw, close-quarters desperation. I met his next jab of flame by shaping a gauntlet of solid rock around my good fist. Our bending became an extension of a brutal, hand-to-hand brawl. Sparks flew as rock met fire in the suffocating darkness. I reinforced my fist against the searing heat with air and fire. He wreathed his own fist in a vortex of sapphire fire, its heat so intense it warped the very air around it into a shimmering haze. We both propelled ourselves as we threw the punch. All four elements collided in a devastating explosion that blasted us both backward.\n\nI skidded across the cavern floor, my body a tapestry of bruises, my makeshift stone gauntlet shattered, and my broken arm screaming in protest. Jinsha cornered me on a crumbling precipice. I was sweating and bleeding freely, exhaustion a lead weight in my limbs. My desperate need for control, the very principle upon which I'd built my new identity as the Avatar, was failing me. Control was an illusion. It was a cage I'd built for myself, and it'd led me here, to this moment of utter defeat. Jinsha's righteous chaos brought him no peace, only more death. Visha’s passivity was a failure. All the paths were wrong. The world needed a balancing force. And to find that balance, I had to let go.\n\nJinsha raised his hand, a corona of blue flame wreathed around it, preparing the final, killing blow. In that moment, as I faced my own annihilation, everything I had fought to control shattered. The power that surged through me was the collected weight of hundreds of lifetimes, a tidal wave of cosmic energy and ancient wisdom. My eyes blazed with an incandescent light that banished the shadows, a pure, white brilliance that made Jinsha’s fierce blue flames look like a pale, flickering candle against a rising sun. For a terrifying second, my old instincts fought back. The control freak in me warred with the tidal wave of the Avatar State, a desperate, futile attempt to cage a hurricane. Then, I surrendered. I'm not broken. I am the Avatar. The world opened up. I felt everything.\n\nThe Avatar State wasn't something to be controlled; it was something to become one with. Jinsha, his face a mask of shock and awe at the light before him, hurled a sun of blue destruction, a desperate attack meant to incinerate me. But with a flick of my wrists, I parted the torrent of blue fire. It flowed harmlessly around me like water around a stone in a river. With a lightning-fast sequence of bending, I wove streams of superheated steam into a blinding, inescapable cage around Jinsha. In that instant of his shocked paralysis, I pulled my palms apart. The ground beneath him deconstructed, revealing the terrifying abyss below. He tried to use his fire jets to escape, but it was too late. I crushed my hands back together. From all sides, massive slabs of stone converged with impossible speed, sealing him in a tomb.\n\nThe incandescent light receded from my eyes, leaving me on my knees, trembling, gasping for air that felt thin and sharp in my burning lungs. My body ached with a thousand wounds, and the ghosts faded from my mind, leaving me Zihuan once more. When Goro and his men finally stormed the cavern, they found a tableau of ruin. Bao-Bao just finished gnawing through the ropes binding a catatonic Bohai, his soul dismantled. Goro led Jinsha away in heavy restraints. As he passed me, he paused, his head held high. The inferno still burned behind his eyes. He met my gaze, and there was no fear or remorse. I read the silent words he mouthed, and they struck my soul with the force of a physical blow. \"You feel the world through the stone, Avatar. You, of all people, should have felt how rotten its foundations were. I was just the earthquake it deserved.\" Then he was gone, a ghost dragged back into the world of light, leaving me alone with the echo of his truth.\n\nIn the days that followed, the rain stopped. For the first time in what felt like a lifetime, a sliver of sunlight pierced the perpetual grey shroud over Jinyang. It was a light that made the grime on the streets glitter, illuminating the scale of the rot that'd been allowed to fester. Jinyang was thrown into chaos, but it was the painful, necessary chaos of lancing a festering wound. Armed with the evidence, I systematically dismantled the city council. Arrests were made, fortunes were seized. The city’s power structure, a monument to greed built on the bones of the poor, crumbled to dust. Bohai, his spirit incinerated by Jinsha’s torture, was the key. Jinsha'd forced him to read aloud from a list: the names of every family his land deal had displaced, every life his corruption had ruined, culminating in the story of Jinsha's own parents. Faced with the litany of his sins, Bohai'd collapsed. He confessed to everything. He cut a deal, providing testimony against his colleagues in exchange for a life of servitude. And he ensured Oana had the finest medicine. It wouldn’t cure her, but it would give her time for the pollution to clear up.\n\nGoro found me on the rooftop of the archives, sorting through the evidence. His face was grim, his shoulders slumped under a weight heavier than any armor. In his calloused hand, he held out his bronze insignia, the symbol of his office. He was ready to resign, swallowed by his shame. His gambling addiction had nearly gotten his friend and the Avatar killed. I looked at this weary, flawed, fundamentally decent man. He had made a terrible mistake. I placed my hand over his, pushing the insignia back into his palm. \"Jinyang needs you...I need you.\" He gave a heavy nod, the weight of a city’s uncertain future settling upon his shoulders. As the new Chief of the Guard, he would maintain the fragile peace. It would fall to me to build something new from the ashes, to guide Jinyang in forming a government that actually served its people.\n\nLater, I stood on that same pagoda where this had all begun, looking out over the changed city. I’d upheld the law, but had I served justice? I’d imprisoned a serial killer, but had I merely protected the corrupt system that'd forged him in its fires? The world wasn't a simple tapestry of right and wrong. It was a thousand shades of murky, compromised gray, and I was standing right in the middle of it.\n\nI felt a familiar, sneaky tug at my belt. I looked down. Bao-Bao had his paws deep inside my pouch, his brow furrowed in concentration as he carefully extracted my last rice cake. He froze, caught red-pawed, and looked up at me with wide, impossibly innocent eyes, a single grain of rice stuck to his nose. For the first time in a long time, I laughed. It was a tired, ragged, aching laugh that shook my entire body. I let him have it. I reached down and pulled him into a hug, burying my face in his soft fur, smelling the familiar scent of stolen fruit. He dropped the rice cake without a second thought and hugged me back, his tiny arms wrapped tight around my neck. The sun was warm on our faces. But I knew, deep in my bones, that I was permanently changed by the rain.",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rain in Jinyang was a language I understood better than spoken words, a dialect of despair I’d become fluent in. It didn’t fall with the clean, crisp rhythm of my Southern Water Tribe home, a sight that promised renewal, but as a persistent, weary liquid shroud over a city-state choking on the haze of countless charcoal fires and pottery kilns, a constant slick through the tiered rooftops with a treacherous sheen of grime. From my perch atop a crumbling pagoda, Jinyang sprawled below, a festering wound. The gleaming, tallow-lamp-lit chambers of the elite on the upper levels were distant, mocking stars. Down here, in the city’s guts, was a labyrinth of rust, poverty, and perpetual shadow. I’d chosen this place as my residence because of this rot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jinyang was a lynchpin. Its kilns fired the ceramics that held the Earth Kingdom’s grain, its clay formed the tiles that roofed its palaces. Its economic stability was the bedrock of the entire eastern seaboard. If Jinyang crumbled, the tremors would crack the foundations of the nation. The world showed that Avatar Visha, my predecessor, had been too passive, an Air Nomad lost in meditation while the world’s problems festered. I, a deaf girl was a bad omen, a broken vessel for Raava. Jinyang would be where I forge a new legacy for the Avatar, one of action and unyielding control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bao-Bao shivered beside me. His panda-white fur was matted down by the drizzle, and his raccoon-striped tail was tucked so tightly between his legs it practically vanished. He chittered and his sharp ears, a gift I envied, swiveled, catching the entire song of the night that was denied to me. He was my ears, my partner, my inseparable shadow. The memory of our meeting was as vivid as the grime on these walls. Years ago, a much lonelier Avatar, newly arrived in this behemoth of a city-state, had her food lifted by a tiny blur. The target had been a still-warm honey-cake, its sweet aroma a fleeting comfort. I gave chase, more amused than angry. The tiny thief scrambled up a tall pagoda, a monument to his audacity, only to freeze in terror at the top. The sight of his petrified form struck a chord deep within me. I gently brought him down with a cushion of air. Instead of reclaiming my belongings, I offered him a piece of the cake. We were two lonely souls finding solace in each other’s silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I drew damp air to me, pulling its scents apart: the sharp sting of coal smoke, the savory steam of spiced turtle-duck broth from a cart three streets over, the sour, gut-turning stench of wet garbage. And beneath it all, something coppery. I tapped Bao-Bao and signed, my movements sharp in the gloom. &amp;quot;Down.&amp;quot; He gave me a look that eloquently communicated his disdain for the plan. He scampered down the nearest bamboo gutter with the practiced ease of a career criminal. I followed, my descent muffled by a cushion of air that displaced the raindrops around me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The terrain was cramped. Councilman Gak, whose lips I’d read countless times spewing practiced platitudes about prosperity now lay sprawled in a puddle of rainwater and his own blood, his fine silk robes soaked a darker shade of crimson. I knelt, planting my bare feet on the cold stone. Closing my eyes, I let the city’s pulse travel up through me. The vibrations painted a grim, three-dimensional picture in my mind. No secondary impacts against the walls. Just the single, brutal, crushing echo of his sternum caving in. The killer was immensely strong, but the attack was almost surgical. An earthbender, perhaps? But the wound wasn&amp;#39;t consistent with a rock projectile. A firebender? No scorch marks. Water? I drew a small sphere of the water from the puddle. I separated the elements within it: water, blood. And a fine, dark powder. Ash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Scrawled on the wall above him in a meticulous paste of ash and blood was a symbol: a perfect circle, with a single, sharp flame inside. A crowd was gathering, their vibrations a messy chorus, and their faces filled with fear and curiosity. One vibration and smell stood out: a frantic, sweaty thrum of pure terror. Before I could pinpoint it, it was gone, swallowed by the growing mob. Heavy footsteps echoed from the mouth of the alley. Goro. The last honest city guard, and my only human friend. “Spirits damn it all, Zihuan.” He ran a hand over his weary, unshaven face. “Another one. First Kail the merchant, now this sack of hot air. The council&amp;#39;s going to have my hide.” He gestured to me. “What do you got, kid?”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No struggle. The killer&amp;#39;s strong. Precise. The symbol&amp;#39;s identical to the one on Kail.&amp;quot; Goro translated for the nervous recruits behind him. “She says our Ashen Ripper&amp;#39;s a meticulous son of a bitch with a real flair for the dramatic. Any of you useless bastards got a clue what this symbol means?” They shook their heads. Behind them, a lanky man with the scent of old papyrus and fear clinging to him, looked like he was about to be sick. He turned and hurried away, melting back into the crowd. Interesting. I took a deep breath, memorizing his specific scent. “Of course not,” Goro sighed. He turned back to me. “And you, BB,” he said, nodding to Bao-Bao, who was attempting a very subtle heist on a dropped coin purse. “Keep your sticky paws to yourself for once.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bao-Bao chittered indignantly, but his little hand had already shot out and snatched a small piece of papyrus from Gak and a silver ring from his finger. Before I could even form the sign for ‘stop’, he was tucking them away. I almost smiled. I followed the scent of the fearful man. It was a trail of pure panic straight to the city archives. The man was a trembling leaf when we found him, trying to bar the door. “I don’t know anything,” he stammered, his heart hammering a frantic rhythm I could feel through the floorboards. “My friend here can tell when you’re lying,” Goro growled, leaning his considerable bulk against the door. “I suggest you tell us what you know before we gets creative.” The old man cracked. “It’s an old zealot’s mark,” he whispered. “The ‘Flame of Rectitude.’ Centuries old. A symbol for purification by fire.” A Fire Nation symbol. So a firebender might be the killer?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our next visit was to the highest tier of the city. Councilman Bohai’s chamber was an exercise in opulent power, all jade and carved rosewood. From his balcony, you couldn’t smell the rot from below. Bohai himself was as polished and handsome as his chamber. “Avatar Zihuan,” he said. “I was so terribly saddened to hear about Gak.” I watched his mouth, my feet planted firmly, letting my seismic sense seep into the marble. His heartbeat was as steady as a master drummer’s. But I felt a faint, discordant tremor in Goro’s pulse. &amp;quot;You two were opponents. His death benefits you.&amp;quot; Goro translated. “She says, tough break about your buddy. Guess that means you’re top dog now, you lucky son of a bitch.&amp;quot; Bohai’s smile didn’t falter, but I felt a flicker of tension in his jaw. He addressed Goro, speaking slowly as if I were a dim-witted child. “Politics is a contentious business. But murder? That’s chaos. And chaos is bad for everyone.” His heart remained steady. Damn him. He was either innocent or possessed a level of control that bordered on unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;My seismic sense isn&amp;#39;t picking up on a lie, Goro. Ask him if he knows anyone who&amp;#39;d want both a merchant and a Councilman dead?&amp;#39; Before Goro could translate, Bohai responded smoothly, “The list of people with grievances in Jinyang&amp;#39;s longer than the Great Wall.” He understood sign language. The whole time. He was watching my hands, gathering information I never intended for him. A cold knot formed in my stomach as I thought about all the council meetings I went to crying for change in Jinyang it. They didn&amp;#39;t usually go perfectly. But I could control the council. I could control Jinyang. I could control everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As we stepped from Bohai’s estate back into the weeping grey of the city, a figure detached itself from the shadows of a nearby archway. His hands were calloused from a lifetime of hard labor. His dark hair was tied in a simple, unadorned top-knot, the kind common among the working class. But it looked wrong. As if it were recently cut, not grown into the style. “Avatar,” he said. “I&amp;#39;m Mr. Bohai&amp;#39;s assistant. The merchant who was killed, Kail, he got into some legal trouble.” &amp;quot;How do you know anything about this?&amp;quot; “I help out in the courts and a man like Kail casts a long shadow, Avatar. Down where I live, his shadow touches everyone. You learn to connect the dots, just to survive.” I planted my feet firmly on the slick cobblestones, letting my seismic sense drink him in. His pulse was a slow, steady drumbeat against the earth. Honest. &amp;quot;Thank you. Your name?&amp;quot; “Jinsha. Fei&amp;#39;s Kail’s enforcer. You’ll usually find him drowning his conscience at The Bottom Feeder.” Before I could ask another question, he gave a respectful bow and melted back into the alleyway.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Bottom Feeder was aptly named. The air was thick with stale ale, cheap perfume, and desperation. The beautiful bartender named Shira said, “Come to finally pay your tab, Goro? Or just to run it up some more before you lose a finger?” Goro’s face flushed. I felt his heart skip a beat. “We’re looking for Fei,” Goro growled. “Never heard of him.” The woman’s heart became a jackhammer of deceit. Simultaneously, I felt the weight of large figures rising from a corner table. &amp;quot;Your heart says you&amp;#39;re lying,&amp;quot; I signed, my gaze fixed on her. &amp;quot;And your friends are about to make a mistake.&amp;quot; A hulking waterbender whipped a tendril of murky water. Goro, moving with surprising grace for a man his size, kicked up his saber and blocked it. A fireball came my way until I caught it in a vortex and redirected it. Bao-Bao scurried up a support pillar and was gleefully dropping eggs onto the brawlers&amp;#39; heads before launching himself onto their backs, a furious menace.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I swept my leg, sending a crescent of air that knocked the firebender off his feet. Goro had the waterbender in a chokehold, his saber a cold threat against their neck. The fight was over in a minute. I stood amidst the groaning men, not a bead of sweat on my brow. Shira’s eyes went wide with fear. &amp;quot;Let’s try this again.&amp;quot; I signed, my fingers moving deliberately, each gesture a command. &amp;quot;Fine. You&amp;#39;re very...convincing,&amp;quot; she stammered, her voice rough. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s over there.&amp;quot; Fei, sweating in a corner booth, sang like a canary. &amp;quot;Kail had the screws to people with some real dough. Had shit on half the politicians in the state.&amp;quot; That meant it would include Gak and Bohai. The pieces clicked into a ugly picture. Bohai wasn’t just a political rival; he was a blackmail victim. The papyrus Bao-Bao had lifted from Gak&amp;#39;s body confirmed it. It was a payment schedule to Kail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That night, we paid Bohai’s chambers another visit. We scaled the building as I bent the air around us as a muffle. Inside, Bao-Bao went to work, pocketing a polished silver inkwell. I felt a faint vibration from a strongbox hidden behind a tapestry. I placed my palm against the cold iron. I sensed the moisture inside the latching mechanism: the dampness in the greased tumblers. I turned the water to ice, expanding it violently. The latch snapped. Bao-Bao scurried through the gap and returned a moment later with a leather-bound ledger. Then I felt a skittering tremor crawling up the stone wall from the outside. It was the distinct signature of a spider-gecko, but heavier. Before I could process anything, a section of the wall directly beside me exploded as a concussive blast of dust and razor-sharp shrapnel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Through the cloud, an earthen dagger, perfectly formed and honed to a wicked point, shot forth. I twisted, a reflexive gasp of air escaping my lips, but it was too fast. It missed my ribs by a hair&amp;#39;s breadth but tore through my thick parka and the flesh beneath, a searing line of pain that stole my breath and left me staggering. A figure stepped through what used to be the wall. With a flick of his wrist, the sand solidified back into an stone behind him. He was clad in worn desert garb, his face a mask of detached, almost cheerful professionalism. “The Avatar herself. And her...oversized rat. Your investigation has become inconvenient.” This was Kobo. A legendary mercenary and, more importantly, Bohai’s personal enforcer. A cold dread, colder than any Southern Tribe winter, washed over me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“Don’t worry.” Kobo continued, taking a step forward. For a hitman, the guy couldn&amp;#39;t shut up. His words were a stream designed to force me to focus on his lips, to split my attention from his lethal hands. I didn’t give him the satisfaction of a reaction. My gaze locked on his, a challenge. &amp;quot;No hard feelings then,&amp;quot; he chirped, &amp;quot;I would hate for you to come after me in your next life!&amp;quot; He lunged and I answered with an explosive blast of fire from my fist. He propelled himself off the floor with a earthbending push, landing on the ceiling. He began to crawl across it like an insect, and from that inverted position, his lips were an unreadable, upside-down blur. His earthen dagger flew from his hand in a ricocheting arc of death. I became a leaf in the wind, twisting and propelling myself with sharp gusts of air, a constant buffer between me and the death that passed my ear.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re qui...but ca…you breathe?” He slammed his hands together. The air grew thick and viscous, swirling with dust and sand pulled from the mortar of the building. It was a blinding, choking storm contained within the chamber. The chaotic swirl of particles rendered my seismic sense a useless, fuzzy cacophony. Bohai must have told him after I accidentally revealed my abilities to him. At the same time, the walls began to constrict. My lungs burned and I summoned moisture around my eyes to clear them. Kobo was everywhere at once, a phantom within his own storm. I felt faint, skittering tremors as he melted through the floor and ceiling as if they were sand, his dagger a constant in the chaos.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I launched fireballs at vibrations that might have been him, but it was like shooting at ghosts. He turned a patch of the floor beneath me to shifting sand, and reacting on instinct, I blasted a cushion of air beneath my feet to stay aloft just as the dagger sliced through the storm towards my head. In that instant, Bao-Bao angled the inkwell. For a split second, it caught a stray glimmer of lamplight through the dust, flashing a blinding pinpoint of light directly into Kobo’s eyes. He flinched. It was barely a tremor, but it was enough. In that same motion, Bao-Bao became a furry missile of defiance, tackling the spinning dagger mid-air and furiously hurling it back into the swirling chaos. Kobo’s eyes widened at the sheer audacity of the raccoon-panda. He twisted away, but the blade was too fast. It caught his cheek, opening a deep, bloody gash. That was the opening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reached for the overwhelming power of the Avatar State. I felt a flicker of cosmic energy, a connection to something vast. But my grip on my own fear, on my desperate need to dominate this fight, to force a victory, was too tight. The connection sputtered and died, leaving me vulnerable. The irony was vicious; my desperate need for control, a direct rebellion against Visha&amp;#39;s passiveness, was the very thing holding me back from my true power.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nowhere to run.&amp;quot; Kobo ragefully brought his fists down and with them, a massive section of the ceiling. I stomped, raising a desperate shield of earth and air above us. The chamber had become a death trap. We were outmatched. I gathered a vortex of compressed elements around my fist. Bao-Bao saw what I was doing and latched onto my back, his claws digging into my parka so hard I could barely feel my own pulse. I punched a cannonball through the wall, blowing a ragged hole out into the rainy night. Without a second thought, we leapt. For the first time since Kobo&amp;#39;d appeared, I could finally breathe.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For a moment, I thought I could be like Laghima and fly. I soon came to understand that wasn&amp;#39;t the reality. The fall was a terrifying, screaming eternity. Bao-Bao frantically tapped my shoulder and I twisted to see a volley of spiked earth hurling towards us. I unleashed a torrent of dragon’s fire, incinerating them mid-air, then flash-froze a cloud to block his pursuit. We were plummeting through Jinyang&amp;#39;s tiers, a dizzying descent. I had to get control. I used airbending to steer our plummet, kicking off walls to change direction. Branches like skeletal fingers clawed at us as the ground rushed up. At the last possible second, I summoned a violent updraft, a desperate cushion against the inevitable. We hit the ground hard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The impact was a jarring crash that shuddered through my entire body, skidding us across the wet, grime-slicked cobblestones. I lay there, gasping, the frantic vibrations of my own ragged breath shaking my chest, the world a dizzying blur of pain. A sickening crunch vibrated up my arm, a sharp, internal crack that I felt through my bones. It was followed by a blinding flash of agony that stole the air from my lungs. My arm was broken, a jagged, unnatural angle beneath the skin, pulsating with every frantic beat of my heart. I brought my other hand to it, my fingers tracing the sharp line of shattered bone. The rain was a healing balm falling from the sky. I drew it to me, cupping the water over the injury, willing my skin to glow with the soft, blue light of healing, a skill I should&amp;#39;ve mastered as a child. But there was nothing. No glow, no soothing energy. Just cold water on a broken limb. Frustration, hot and bitter as kiln smoke, rose in my throat as tears stained my eyes. I was broken.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The grim finality of my thoughts was punctuated by a wet heaving I felt through my cloak. Bao-Bao, uncurling from my neck, promptly threw up a half-digested steamed bun onto the cobblestones beside my head. We were battered, broken, and disgusted, but alive. We had to disappear into the city&amp;#39;s gut; so we scrambled to Goro’s home that smelled of medicinal herbs and savory broth. A young girl with her father’s kind eyes lay on a cot. Oana. Her lungs were failing, a casualty of the city’s polluted air. Healing couldn&amp;#39;t purify lungs choked by years of inhaling kiln-ash, a sickness woven into the very fabric of the city. It was a wound I couldn&amp;#39;t control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“So Bohai sent Kobo to kill you,” Goro summarized. “He has to be our killer.” It felt too simple. While he splinted my arm, I studied the ledger. The coded document Bao-Bao&amp;#39;d stolen was only a list of blackmail payments. The ledger detailed a massive, illegal land deal involving the city’s richest clay deposits: land that&amp;#39;d been seized from working-class families. The pollution from the mines was a direct result of their greed. The politicians, including Gak and Bohai, got rich. The blackmailers, like Kail, got paid to stay quiet and benefit from the corruption. One family of Fire Nation immigrants had lost more than most. Disgraced and penniless, they killed themselves, their bodies found by their son named Jinsha. Kobo was the enforcer who&amp;#39;d personally evicted them. My blood ran cold. The final name on the blackmailer’s list was a magistrate named Kyo, the one who’d stamped the fraudulent deal. We had to move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bao-Bao and I propelled forward as I created jets of fire from my feet, skating over the wet cobblestones on a ramp of ice, leaping between rooftops with gusts of air, propelling myself up walls with pillars of earth. It was a frantic, desperate race against a clock. We burst into Kyo’s home to find him dying, the Flame of Rectitude painted above him. As he took his last, ragged breaths I saw him: a far away figure leaping into the night. For a split second, a flare of blue fire illuminated his escape. The Earth Kingdom top-knot was a lie. He’d cut his hair, the Fire Nation sign of ultimate dishonor. It all crashed into place with the force of a tidal wave. Jinsha was the Ashen Ripper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Watching Kyo die, my heightened senses made it a visceral nightmare. I didn&amp;#39;t just see it; I felt the life stutter and cease in his chest through the floorboards, a final, fading tremor in the song of the earth. I saw the light drain from his eyes, and through the charged air, I could smell the faint charred scent of flesh. It broke something inside me. The belief that I could fix this rotten system piece by piece, felt like a fool’s dream. My path had led to a dead body at my feet. The investigation was over. The hunt was on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ignoring the cacophony of the city, I stretched out my senses, my mind a predator’s. I focused on the lingering heat of Jinsha’s fire, moving through Jinyang with a predatory purpose. An urchin darted through the crowd during our pursuit and pressed a note into Goro’s hand. I watched the color drain from his face as his eyes scanned the parchment. His hand beginning to tremble so violently I could feel the frantic vibration through the floorboards. His heart rate, a steady drumbeat even in chaos, spiked into a frantic rhythm. “That was one of my informants. Heard a rumor about an illegal shipment down at the docks. Might be…connected.” Goro&amp;#39;s heart screamed lie. But this was Goro. Everything was under control. I let him lead me to the docks where the air thick with the smell of damp wood and something else...a faint scent of whale oil.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, kid.&amp;quot; The docks erupted in a ball of fire. I shoved Goro forward with all my might and threw myself backward, erecting a hasty wall of earth just as the force of the blast threw me like a doll. I slammed into a brick wall, my broken arm screaming in protest. Through the pressure that threatened to pop my eyes from my skull, I saw Goro, safe. “He had me,” Goro choked out, collapsing beside me. “Bohai. He… he owned my gambling debts. The money for Oana’s medicine… I lost it, Zihuan. I lost it all. Bohai said…lead you here…and Oana would get the best medicine. My debt would be gone. If I didn’t… he’d have me thrown in a cell to rot, and Oana would.” Bao-Bao and I raced to Bohai estate, abandoning Goro; but even as my feet pounded the slick stone, I was already there.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I &amp;quot;watched&amp;quot; through the stone and felt two distinct vibrations clashing in a frantic, deadly dance. One was Kobo&amp;#39;s: fluid, evasive, a spider-like skittering across the marble floors. The other was a focused, explosive power, each footfall a concussive blast of energy. I felt heat and Kobo’s defenses melt into slag. I felt a brutal impact as Kobo’s vibration was snuffed out, and then a single, powerful tremor moving away, carrying another one along with it. We found Kobo crumpled outside Bohai’s estate, his body broken. He was alive, barely. I knelt beside him. Kobo coughed out, “Blue fire…a demon…” he said, his eyes wide with a terror that transcended pain. “He took him… said he was going to cleanse him in fire.” Jinsha’s lair had to be somewhere connected fire and the source of the corruption...the mines. Bao-Bao and I ventured alone. I couldn&amp;#39;t trust Goro. I had this under control.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Deep beneath the city, where the very earth was stripped away for profit, Jinsha&amp;#39;d carved out his sanctuary of vengeance. The entrance was led deep into the belly of Jinyang. I trailed my good hand along the damp stone wall, my bare feet mapping the floor. I felt a false step connected to a rockfall trap. A tripwire taut as a predator&amp;#39;s nerve. With a flick of air or a precise shift of a pebble, I disarmed them, my movements economical and pained. Finally, my seismic sense detected it: a section of wall that felt different. The vibration didn&amp;#39;t continue through it; it echoed back, hollow. A concentrated earthbending push with my palm, and a ton of stone slid open, revealing a descent into oppressive heat and darkness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lair was a vast cavern. Rotting wooden scaffolding crisscrossed the cavernous space. The air was thick, tasting of burnt coal. This was a place of obsession. Crude instruments of torture, improvised from mining equipment, were laid out on a stone slab with chilling precision. But the heart of the chamber, illuminated by an eerie blue flame, was a massive map of the city carved into the far wall. Threads of twine connected every victim, every location, every piece of evidence. Kail, Gak, and Kyo had red X&amp;#39;s scrawled across them in what I knew was a paste of ash and blood. And at the center of it all, was a faded ink-painting of a smiling man and woman. Jinsha parents. Below it, tied to a chair, was Bohai. He was gagged, bloody, his polished facade stripped away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;High on a gantry, silhouetted against the hypnotic dance of his blue flame, stood Jinsha. His head was shaved clean, the mark of a man who&amp;#39;d renounced his nation and his honor, leaving only a core of pure, unadulterated purpose. He turned, and in the oppressive darkness of the mine, his face was a mask of unnerving calm, carved by grief into something resolute. The flames cast jagged, dancing shadows across his features, making his sorrow look alive. “Avatar. What are you going to do? Protect him? He&amp;#39;s an architect of misery.” I stepped forward. Bao-Bao’s claws dug into my shoulder, a tense, grounding weight. My fingers moved, shaping the signs in the flickering blue light, each gesture deliberate. &amp;quot;He is the key. His testimony will bring down the entire corrupt council. He&amp;#39;ll face the law.&amp;quot; Jinsha let out a broken laugh. “The law?” he mouthed with a venom that chilled me more than the damp cavern air. “The law is a tool for men like him, Avatar. A shield they hide behind. I saw no law when Kobo threw my family into the mud. The law&amp;#39;s a fairy tale the corrupt tell the poor to keep them from picking up torches.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not creating justice, Jinsha. You&amp;#39;re tipping the scales toward chaos. Stop before it&amp;#39;s too late,&amp;quot; I signed, my movements growing more desperate, more frantic. The word &amp;#39;chaos&amp;#39; ignited something in him. With a roar that vibrated through the very rock beneath my feet, he slammed his fist into the stone wall beside him. “Chaos is people hanging themselves because they couldn&amp;#39;t bear to watch their children starve! Chaos is a city built on the bones of the poor, where those on high drink imported wine while we drink water poisoned by their mines! I&amp;#39;m not the chaos.” He took a step forward, into the full, haunting glare of his own fire. “I&amp;#39;m the consequence.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Searing heat shot up through the soles of my bare feet. I looked down in confusion. The stone walkway beneath me wasn&amp;#39;t just hot; it was glowing a menacing cherry-red, the very rock liquefying under a focused assault. I was forced into a desperate leap, propelled by a violent blast of air from my heel. I landed hard on a lower platform, a jarring impact that sent a fresh wave of agony screaming up my splinted, broken arm. The world swam in a haze of pain. Before I could even reorient, the darkness around me erupted. Jinsha moved with the fluid grace of a dancer possessed by his own fire. He wasn&amp;#39;t just attacking me; he was deconstructing the battlefield. With precise, searing jets of blue fire, he sliced through the thick, rust-eaten support chains of the massive wooden scaffolding that crisscrossed the cavern above. A series of frantic, sharp taps on my left shoulder—Bao-Bao’s signal for a projectile, high and widespread!—was my only warning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stomped my foot, raising a crude, desperate shield of stone just as tons of splintering wood and rusted metal crashed down around us. The concussive force was a physical assault that shook me to my core, the vibrations a chaotic scream in my feet. Darkness and dust swallowed everything. My seismic sense was useless. All I could see was the ghost of his blue fire, a phantom dancing in the suffocating black. An explosion to my right threw me against a rock wall, knocking the wind from my lungs. He was igniting hidden pockets of whale oil, the same trick from the docks. You learn to connect the dots, just to survive. He had planned this. He must have known about Goro’s debts and offered Bohai a deal: use Goro to get me out of the way, and he lives. It was all to get to Bohai.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was forced to become a blur, relying on desperate, kicking air and fire blasts to propel myself through the collapsing maze. My movements were clumsy, ragged, my broken arm a dead weight. I launched a volley of stone discs, each one spun and sharpened to a razor&amp;#39;s edge. Jinsha danced between them, melting them to slag mid-air with precise flames until a bolt of concentrated blue fire, hot enough to melt steel, shot at the whimpering, terrified Bohai. “No!” The word was a silent scream in my throat. Bao-Bao was a cannonball, landing on the back of the heavy wooden chair. As I created a shield of rock to intercept the flame—Bao-Bao used his entire body weight, digging his claws in, and heaved. The chair tipped, and Bohai, still bound, crashed to the stone, rolling him out of the path of a blast that vaporized the spot where his head had just been.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“His testimony&amp;#39;s meaningless in a world without justice. After I kill him, I&amp;#39;ll burn my way through the entire council.” Frustration boiled in my gut. I abandoned ranged attacks for raw, close-quarters desperation. I met his next jab of flame by shaping a gauntlet of solid rock around my good fist. Our bending became an extension of a brutal, hand-to-hand brawl. Sparks flew as rock met fire in the suffocating darkness. I reinforced my fist against the searing heat with air and fire. He wreathed his own fist in a vortex of sapphire fire, its heat so intense it warped the very air around it into a shimmering haze. We both propelled ourselves as we threw the punch. All four elements collided in a devastating explosion that blasted us both backward.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I skidded across the cavern floor, my body a tapestry of bruises, my makeshift stone gauntlet shattered, and my broken arm screaming in protest. Jinsha cornered me on a crumbling precipice. I was sweating and bleeding freely, exhaustion a lead weight in my limbs. My desperate need for control, the very principle upon which I&amp;#39;d built my new identity as the Avatar, was failing me. Control was an illusion. It was a cage I&amp;#39;d built for myself, and it&amp;#39;d led me here, to this moment of utter defeat. Jinsha&amp;#39;s righteous chaos brought him no peace, only more death. Visha’s passivity was a failure. All the paths were wrong. The world needed a balancing force. And to find that balance, I had to let go.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Jinsha raised his hand, a corona of blue flame wreathed around it, preparing the final, killing blow. In that moment, as I faced my own annihilation, everything I had fought to control shattered. The power that surged through me was the collected weight of hundreds of lifetimes, a tidal wave of cosmic energy and ancient wisdom. My eyes blazed with an incandescent light that banished the shadows, a pure, white brilliance that made Jinsha’s fierce blue flames look like a pale, flickering candle against a rising sun. For a terrifying second, my old instincts fought back. The control freak in me warred with the tidal wave of the Avatar State, a desperate, futile attempt to cage a hurricane. Then, I surrendered. I&amp;#39;m not broken. I am the Avatar. The world opened up. I felt everything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Avatar State wasn&amp;#39;t something to be controlled; it was something to become one with. Jinsha, his face a mask of shock and awe at the light before him, hurled a sun of blue destruction, a desperate attack meant to incinerate me. But with a flick of my wrists, I parted the torrent of blue fire. It flowed harmlessly around me like water around a stone in a river. With a lightning-fast sequence of bending, I wove streams of superheated steam into a blinding, inescapable cage around Jinsha. In that instant of his shocked paralysis, I pulled my palms apart. The ground beneath him deconstructed, revealing the terrifying abyss below. He tried to use his fire jets to escape, but it was too late. I crushed my hands back together. From all sides, massive slabs of stone converged with impossible speed, sealing him in a tomb.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The incandescent light receded from my eyes, leaving me on my knees, trembling, gasping for air that felt thin and sharp in my burning lungs. My body ached with a thousand wounds, and the ghosts faded from my mind, leaving me Zihuan once more. When Goro and his men finally stormed the cavern, they found a tableau of ruin. Bao-Bao just finished gnawing through the ropes binding a catatonic Bohai, his soul dismantled. Goro led Jinsha away in heavy restraints. As he passed me, he paused, his head held high. The inferno still burned behind his eyes. He met my gaze, and there was no fear or remorse. I read the silent words he mouthed, and they struck my soul with the force of a physical blow. &amp;quot;You feel the world through the stone, Avatar. You, of all people, should have felt how rotten its foundations were. I was just the earthquake it deserved.&amp;quot; Then he was gone, a ghost dragged back into the world of light, leaving me alone with the echo of his truth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the days that followed, the rain stopped. For the first time in what felt like a lifetime, a sliver of sunlight pierced the perpetual grey shroud over Jinyang. It was a light that made the grime on the streets glitter, illuminating the scale of the rot that&amp;#39;d been allowed to fester. Jinyang was thrown into chaos, but it was the painful, necessary chaos of lancing a festering wound. Armed with the evidence, I systematically dismantled the city council. Arrests were made, fortunes were seized. The city’s power structure, a monument to greed built on the bones of the poor, crumbled to dust. Bohai, his spirit incinerated by Jinsha’s torture, was the key. Jinsha&amp;#39;d forced him to read aloud from a list: the names of every family his land deal had displaced, every life his corruption had ruined, culminating in the story of Jinsha&amp;#39;s own parents. Faced with the litany of his sins, Bohai&amp;#39;d collapsed. He confessed to everything. He cut a deal, providing testimony against his colleagues in exchange for a life of servitude. And he ensured Oana had the finest medicine. It wouldn’t cure her, but it would give her time for the pollution to clear up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Goro found me on the rooftop of the archives, sorting through the evidence. His face was grim, his shoulders slumped under a weight heavier than any armor. In his calloused hand, he held out his bronze insignia, the symbol of his office. He was ready to resign, swallowed by his shame. His gambling addiction had nearly gotten his friend and the Avatar killed. I looked at this weary, flawed, fundamentally decent man. He had made a terrible mistake. I placed my hand over his, pushing the insignia back into his palm. &amp;quot;Jinyang needs you...I need you.&amp;quot; He gave a heavy nod, the weight of a city’s uncertain future settling upon his shoulders. As the new Chief of the Guard, he would maintain the fragile peace. It would fall to me to build something new from the ashes, to guide Jinyang in forming a government that actually served its people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Later, I stood on that same pagoda where this had all begun, looking out over the changed city. I’d upheld the law, but had I served justice? I’d imprisoned a serial killer, but had I merely protected the corrupt system that&amp;#39;d forged him in its fires? The world wasn&amp;#39;t a simple tapestry of right and wrong. It was a thousand shades of murky, compromised gray, and I was standing right in the middle of it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I felt a familiar, sneaky tug at my belt. I looked down. Bao-Bao had his paws deep inside my pouch, his brow furrowed in concentration as he carefully extracted my last rice cake. He froze, caught red-pawed, and looked up at me with wide, impossibly innocent eyes, a single grain of rice stuck to his nose. For the first time in a long time, I laughed. It was a tired, ragged, aching laugh that shook my entire body. I let him have it. I reached down and pulled him into a hug, burying my face in his soft fur, smelling the familiar scent of stolen fruit. He dropped the rice cake without a second thought and hugged me back, his tiny arms wrapped tight around my neck. The sun was warm on our faces. But I knew, deep in my bones, that I was permanently changed by the rain.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I’m now at a production studio in NYC for the last 2.5  years but have been looking at some other jobs to apply to. \n\nLet me begin with why I’m looking to move. The work is boring and I fear that I may stay complacent at low pay and bad physical health risk.  The other huge issue is that I don’t know what I want in life. So I’d like to see what some other potters are doing and if you have any advice for someone still young in the industry. \n\nI’ve turned down three production studios offers already to stay at my current job. Complacency or loyalty have become one in my unsure mind. But now, I received a second offer from one of those three places for another position they call, ‘senior production member’ which involves more sculptural technique at a similar pay. \n\nI thought I’d never want to work in another production environment since I’ve already worked at two places.  I love the simple tasks and low mental stress, but wonder if the physical and respiratory effects are worth it. If I take the offer from this next production studio, I’m worried I’ll get stuck there for another 3 years doing only slightly more interesting work in a smaller studio when maybe I should be considering other careers or going back to school. Is clay even for me anymore? The only thing I know is that I’m good at it and not computers haha. \n\nAnd maybe a little background about me would help. I’m 24, an NYC native who can’t drive yet, is depressed and has very low motivation as a result. I’ve held on to an old dream of making miniatures (dollhouse scale) for collectors or owning a knickknack shop with handmade and local products. If I want to do any of those things, I imagine it would be far in the future and would require a lifetime of the kind of savings I make at production studios. \n\nThanks so much.

We had a cone in and the power button engaged while it was on. The elements had a low voltage running through them, so the electrician thought perhaps it was the switches...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to get this working and looking for a diagram or manual for the electrician who is not familiar with kilns. Does anyone have experience with this or knowledge to share? Could I replace dials or upgrade the whole interface to make it more user friendly.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I hope I've come to the right place for this, and that someone here can point me in the right direction.\n\nSo, to get right to the topic of my project that I need help figuring out:\n\nMy brother has a young boy that's growing up fast and when I found this out in his backyard, decrepit and forgotten, I thought if I could fix'er up It would make for a great christmas present next year (if I can manage to get it together by then). After a nice and thorough washing, inside and out, it turns out it was in great condition. Or at least the main body was, once all the heavy sediment and grime was washed off. I plan on cleaning the rust off the spring and potentially painting it with a protective coating to prevent future corrosion/rust. I'm unsure if I will ultimately fit it for indoor or outdoor use, they have a pretty big house and yard so I don't think that will be an issue in either event. The base had more or less an X or + shape of maybe 1.75 inch to 2 Inch wooden posts to stabilize it but I will likely do in a slightly different direction with the base when I come to that. I saved the wooden posts and dowels that are used to mount the horse to the spring (the posts go through the square holes in the pictures down below and attach to the 4 arms that come off the spring, the dowels go through the circular holes where the hands and feet rest.) I'm not sure if I will sand and stain/seal these to use or just replace them as they are made of fairly strong wood and didn't suffer too much wear. \n\nHere are some pictures, and I will get to my main problem I need suggestions on. I'm also open to any suggestions or advice on any other aspects of this project, as I naturally want to impress my nephew and his parents with this beauty.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nvmp62h5qgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=857ae676fb4296f3663f395e4fd0b829cf43546b\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ed2wtyb7qgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c845e9ee636415942b98ea8ec64b50f11237abc2\n\nAint she a beaut?\n\n  \nThe Spring Base:\n\n[upside-down](https://preview.redd.it/6hbfoto9qgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cab7d8514023276cee887bac534d71f72cb0e474)\n\n[The wooden posts that were configured in an x shape were bolted to the bottom there but I got rid of the nuts and bolts because they were too degraded. I'm open to suggestions on the base and would like to do something more structurally sound than what it had due to the idea I'll get into down below.](https://preview.redd.it/xf1wqdg0rgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ab7117de42f8b4e2b57afddc44ab436935201058)\n\n*^(\\*Note: I have a flux-cored wire fed/and SMAW arc welder that may come in handy here if I want to use metal in the base\\*)*\n\nHere is a close up of where the wood posts that attach to the spring base on those 4 arms (The square slots) followed by the circular slots the handles and foot rests go into.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hnmmaob1sgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=eca4bd88c48f76ad445522915e6602eb133c6429\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/wnl60xf2sgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94b65c316856a35719ef6291074a1f3798d99f69\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3efdb943sgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=72b748bd5e381416c83c47bd94c797d28b9c54ad\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/o76mozg3sgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a568be6ec6289395fabaca73130c5ac83ba7830\n\nand here is the wood I may spiffy up and use:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9hkkrod6sgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d78247d671b76eb4e40446f83e8ccb974d1b0a8c\n\nI've also drilled a hole in the lowest part of the horse to make sure the inside is dry after washing the interior out. It has been hanging for a month or so, so I'm certain it's dried already.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/brsyks7fsgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8acaa14e5a338d966be3bc89b4199224edf01c70\n\nAlright, I know I said it at the beginning so it will sound silly but let's get down to what I'm asking of you handsie dandy handy men of experience! Since the beginning I acquired this with the intention of filling the inside with something that will give it structural support (to the body itself as well as the posts going into it, especially given the fact they will likely be a tiny bit smaller than they are depending how i go about sanding and stain/coating them, so it can't be loose fitting.) as well as providing a bit of heft and a solid feel to it. I'm thinking the extra weight will add to its rocking springy fun-ness, making it fun for the las who isn't big enough to rock it too hard. I would hate to have him tire of it because it won't budge, that spring is stiff and strong as hell.\n\n  \nI've asked google AI for suggestions and it's suggested things like poly resin and steel shot or ball bearings, certain kinds of expanding insulation with kiln dried sand, and of course it warned me that filling it with too much of certain resins and expanding materials could deform, melt (due to exothermic reactions in resins, should apply coats), or straight up bust it up. I believe it's made of polypropylene or polyurethane but I'm not sure honestly, but I assume that bears keeping in mind when deciding what to utilize inside the body.\n\n\n\nSo there you have it, please feel free to provide any kind of advice or suggestion for this and I would be very grateful for the assistance! Thanks for taking the time to read this and consider my plight. ",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there Handy Men, I come to you in search of advice on materials, methods, tips and general advice. I hope I&amp;#39;ve come to the right place for this, and that someone here can point me in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, to get right to the topic of my project that I need help figuring out:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My brother has a young boy that&amp;#39;s growing up fast and when I found this out in his backyard, decrepit and forgotten, I thought if I could fix&amp;#39;er up It would make for a great christmas present next year (if I can manage to get it together by then). After a nice and thorough washing, inside and out, it turns out it was in great condition. Or at least the main body was, once all the heavy sediment and grime was washed off. I plan on cleaning the rust off the spring and potentially painting it with a protective coating to prevent future corrosion/rust. I&amp;#39;m unsure if I will ultimately fit it for indoor or outdoor use, they have a pretty big house and yard so I don&amp;#39;t think that will be an issue in either event. The base had more or less an X or + shape of maybe 1.75 inch to 2 Inch wooden posts to stabilize it but I will likely do in a slightly different direction with the base when I come to that. I saved the wooden posts and dowels that are used to mount the horse to the spring (the posts go through the square holes in the pictures down below and attach to the 4 arms that come off the spring, the dowels go through the circular holes where the hands and feet rest.) I&amp;#39;m not sure if I will sand and stain/seal these to use or just replace them as they are made of fairly strong wood and didn&amp;#39;t suffer too much wear. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Here are some pictures, and I will get to my main problem I need suggestions on. I&amp;#39;m also open to any suggestions or advice on any other aspects of this project, as I naturally want to impress my nephew and his parents with this beauty.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/nvmp62h5qgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=857ae676fb4296f3663f395e4fd0b829cf43546b\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/nvmp62h5qgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=857ae676fb4296f3663f395e4fd0b829cf43546b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/ed2wtyb7qgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c845e9ee636415942b98ea8ec64b50f11237abc2\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/ed2wtyb7qgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=c845e9ee636415942b98ea8ec64b50f11237abc2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aint she a beaut?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Spring Base:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/6hbfoto9qgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cab7d8514023276cee887bac534d71f72cb0e474\"&gt;upside-down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/xf1wqdg0rgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=ab7117de42f8b4e2b57afddc44ab436935201058\"&gt;The wooden posts that were configured in an x shape were bolted to the bottom there but I got rid of the nuts and bolts because they were too degraded.

It has been hanging for a month or so, so I&amp;#39;m certain it&amp;#39;s dried already.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/brsyks7fsgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8acaa14e5a338d966be3bc89b4199224edf01c70\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/brsyks7fsgdg1.jpg?width=3000&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=8acaa14e5a338d966be3bc89b4199224edf01c70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Alright, I know I said it at the beginning so it will sound silly but let&amp;#39;s get down to what I&amp;#39;m asking of you handsie dandy handy men of experience! Since the beginning I acquired this with the intention of filling the inside with something that will give it structural support (to the body itself as well as the posts going into it, especially given the fact they will likely be a tiny bit smaller than they are depending how i go about sanding and stain/coating them, so it can&amp;#39;t be loose fitting.) as well as providing a bit of heft and a solid feel to it. I&amp;#39;m thinking the extra weight will add to its rocking springy fun-ness, making it fun for the las who isn&amp;#39;t big enough to rock it too hard. I would hate to have him tire of it because it won&amp;#39;t budge, that spring is stiff and strong as hell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve asked google AI for suggestions and it&amp;#39;s suggested things like poly resin and steel shot or ball bearings, certain kinds of expanding insulation with kiln dried sand, and of course it warned me that filling it with too much of certain resins and expanding materials could deform, melt (due to exothermic reactions in resins, should apply coats), or straight up bust it up. I believe it&amp;#39;s made of polypropylene or polyurethane but I&amp;#39;m not sure honestly, but I assume that bears keeping in mind when deciding what to utilize inside the body.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, please feel free to provide any kind of advice or suggestion for this and I would be very grateful for the assistance! Thanks for taking the time to read this and consider my plight. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Road salt, traffic film, mineral residue, and heavy grime build quickly, while cold temperatures limit dwell time and safe agitation. Despite those challenges, winter washing remains critical for preserving paint, wheels, and coatings.\n\nWhen weather is not cooperating, washing is not about aggressive scrubbing or complicated steps. It is about using the right chemistry, applying it efficiently, and letting the products do the work.\n\nThis approach relies on four core products and a simple foam-and-rinse process using an Active pressure washer and Foam Cannon. Not sure which Pressure Washer is for you? Check out our helpful article on choosing the correct Active Pressure Washer for your needs: [Active Pressure Washer Buyers Guide](https://blog.esotericcarcare.com/active-pressure-washer-buyers-guide/)\n\n# Why Winter Car Washing Requires a Different Approach\n\nCold weather contamination behaves differently than summer dirt. Salt residue bonds aggressively to surfaces, traffic film becomes heavier, and wheels accumulate brake dust and corrosive build up faster.\n\nTreating winter washing like a standard maintenance wash often leads to over-agitation, poor results, or unnecessary surface wear. The solution is targeted chemistry applied evenly and removed safely.\n\nFoam application and controlled rinsing allow cleaning agents to work without relying on heavy contact, which is especially important during winter months.\n\n# The Value of a Simple Foam and Rinse Process\n\nUsing an Active pressure washer paired with a quality foam cannon allows winter car washing products to be applied evenly and efficiently across the vehicle. This method provides consistent dwell, reduces the need for brushing, and improves overall cleaning performance in cold conditions.\n\nFoaming helps:\n\n* Keep products active longer in cold air\n* Distribute cleaners evenly across panels\n* Loosen salt and traffic film before rinsing\n* Minimize physical contact with sensitive surfaces\n\nWhen paired with proper chemistry, a foam-and-rinse process becomes one of the safest and most effective ways to manage winter contamination.\n\n# ESOTERIC Strip Wash Shampoo\n\n# Resetting Winter Buildup\n\n[ESOTERIC Strip Wash Shampoo](https://esotericcarcare.com/products/esoteric-strip-wash-shampoo) is used when winter contamination goes beyond normal maintenance washing. Salt residue, traffic film, and old protection layers can prevent surfaces from rinsing clean or responding properly to fresh protection.\n\nFoamed through a cannon or applied via wash media, ESOTERIC Strip Wash Shampoo helps break down stubborn buildup without unpredictable behavior. It is particularly useful mid-winter when protection performance drops or before applying a fresh sealant once temperatures allow.\n\nIn winter workflows, [ESOTERIC Strip Wash Shampoo](https://esotericcarcare.com/products/esoteric-strip-wash-shampoo) is about restoration and reset, not aggression. Safe for ceramic coatings, it can degrade waxes &amp; sealants.\n\n#  Kamikaze Acid Shampoo\n\n# Addressing Salt and Mineral Residue\n\nSome winter contamination cannot be removed effectively with alkaline or neutral cleaners alone. [Kamikaze Acid Shampoo](https://esotericcarcare.com/products/kamikaze-collection-kmkz-acid-shampoo) is designed to target mineral deposits, salt residue, and inorganic contamination that lingers after conventional washing.\n\nUsed selectively and correctly, it restores surface clarity and helps coatings perform as intended. Lower panels, wheels, and heavily exposed areas benefit most during winter months.\n\n[Kamikaze Acid Shampoo](https://esotericcarcare.com/products/kamikaze-collection-kmkz-acid-shampoo) is not an every-wash product. It is a precision tool used when conditions require it. Safe for ceramic coatings, it can degrade waxes &amp; sealants.\n\n# ESOTERIC APC &amp; Tire Cleaner\n\n# Controlled Strength Where It Matters\n\nWinter washing often demands focused cleaning on tires, wheel wells &amp; All-Weather Floor Mats. ESOTERIC [APC &amp; Tire Cleaner](https://esotericcarcare.com/products/esoteric-apc-tire-cleaner) provides controlled cleaning strength with predictable behavior across a wide range of surfaces.\n\nSprayed on, brushed (if applicable) and rinsed off, it excels at breaking down heavy grime without unnecessary harshness. Its versatility allows it to slot easily into winter wash routines without adding complexity.\n\n# ESOTERIC Wheel Cleaner\n\n# Efficient Winter Wheel Care\n\nWheels take the brunt of winter driving. Brake dust, salt, and road grime accumulate quickly and can be difficult to remove safely in cold conditions.\n\n[ESOTERIC Wheel Cleaner](https://esotericcarcare.com/products/esoteric-wheel-cleaner) is designed to work evenly and rinse clean, making it ideal for frequent winter use. Spray onto wheels as directed and rinsed thoroughly, it reduces the need for aggressive brushing while maintaining consistent results on coated and uncoated wheels.\n\nEfficient cleaning matters most when temperatures limit dwell time and comfort.\n\n# A Studio-Tested Winter Workflow\n\nA typical form &amp; rinse winter wash often follows this structure:\n\n* Foam the vehicle using ESOTERIC Strip Wash Shampoo or ESOTERIC pH Neutral Shampoo as conditions dictate\n* Address wheels &amp; tires with Wheel Cleaner and APC respectively\n* Use Kamikaze Collection Acid Wash where salt &amp; mineral deposits dictate extra attention\n* Rinse thoroughly using controlled pressure\n* Minimize contact unless absolutely necessary\n\n#  Winter Wash Videos\n\nVideo: [Winter Washing - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umxokl3-MG0)\n\nVideo: [Winter Washing - Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ybd_3Py7GA)\n\nVideo: [Winter Washing - Tires &amp; Wheels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4wbWhfrNlQ)\n\nVideo: [Winter Washing - Cleaning All-Weather Floor Mats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7f6TZfjW5I)\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nWinter car washing does not need to be aggressive or complicated. With the right products and a thoughtful foam-and-rinse process, it is possible to manage winter contamination effectively while protecting modern paint, coatings, and wheels.\n\nThese are the same products and methods we rely on throughout winter in our own studio. They are chosen for predictable behavior, ease of use, and real-world performance when conditions are far from ideal.\n\nWinter may be harsh, but your winter car washing process does not have to be!",

Road salt, traffic film, mineral residue, and heavy grime build quickly, while cold temperatures limit dwell time and safe agitation. Despite those challenges, winter washing remains critical for preserving paint, wheels, and coatings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When weather is not cooperating, washing is not about aggressive scrubbing or complicated steps. It is about using the right chemistry, applying it efficiently, and letting the products do the work.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This approach relies on four core products and a simple foam-and-rinse process using an Active pressure washer and Foam Cannon. Not sure which Pressure Washer is for you? Check out our helpful article on choosing the correct Active Pressure Washer for your needs: &lt;a href=\"https://blog.esotericcarcare.com/active-pressure-washer-buyers-guide/\"&gt;Active Pressure Washer Buyers Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Why Winter Car Washing Requires a Different Approach&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cold weather contamination behaves differently than summer dirt. Salt residue bonds aggressively to surfaces, traffic film becomes heavier, and wheels accumulate brake dust and corrosive build up faster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Treating winter washing like a standard maintenance wash often leads to over-agitation, poor results, or unnecessary surface wear. The solution is targeted chemistry applied evenly and removed safely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Foam application and controlled rinsing allow cleaning agents to work without relying on heavy contact, which is especially important during winter months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;The Value of a Simple Foam and Rinse Process&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using an Active pressure washer paired with a quality foam cannon allows winter car washing products to be applied evenly and efficiently across the vehicle. This method provides consistent dwell, reduces the need for brushing, and improves overall cleaning performance in cold conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Foaming helps:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Keep products active longer in cold air&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Distribute cleaners evenly across panels&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Loosen salt and traffic film before rinsing&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Minimize physical contact with sensitive surfaces&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When paired with proper chemistry, a foam-and-rinse process becomes one of the safest and most effective ways to manage winter contamination.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;ESOTERIC Strip Wash Shampoo&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Resetting Winter Buildup&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://esotericcarcare.com/products/esoteric-strip-wash-shampoo\"&gt;ESOTERIC Strip Wash Shampoo&lt;/a&gt; is used when winter contamination goes beyond normal maintenance washing. Salt residue, traffic film, and old protection layers can prevent surfaces from rinsing clean or responding properly to fresh protection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Foamed through a cannon or applied via wash media, ESOTERIC Strip Wash Shampoo helps break down stubborn buildup without unpredictable behavior. It is particularly useful mid-winter when protection performance drops or before applying a fresh sealant once temperatures allow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In winter workflows, &lt;a href=\"https://esotericcarcare.com/products/esoteric-strip-wash-shampoo\"&gt;ESOTERIC Strip Wash Shampoo&lt;/a&gt; is about restoration and reset, not aggression. Safe for ceramic coatings, it can degrade waxes &amp;amp; sealants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt; Kamikaze Acid Shampoo&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Addressing Salt and Mineral Residue&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some winter contamination cannot be removed effectively with alkaline or neutral cleaners alone. &lt;a href=\"https://esotericcarcare.com/products/kamikaze-collection-kmkz-acid-shampoo\"&gt;Kamikaze Acid Shampoo&lt;/a&gt; is designed to target mineral deposits, salt residue, and inorganic contamination that lingers after conventional washing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Used selectively and correctly, it restores surface clarity and helps coatings perform as intended. Lower panels, wheels, and heavily exposed areas benefit most during winter months.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://esotericcarcare.com/products/kamikaze-collection-kmkz-acid-shampoo\"&gt;Kamikaze Acid Shampoo&lt;/a&gt; is not an every-wash product. It is a precision tool used when conditions require it. Safe for ceramic coatings, it can degrade waxes &amp;amp; sealants.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;ESOTERIC APC &amp;amp; Tire Cleaner&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Controlled Strength Where It Matters&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Winter washing often demands focused cleaning on tires, wheel wells &amp;amp; All-Weather Floor Mats. ESOTERIC &lt;a href=\"https://esotericcarcare.com/products/esoteric-apc-tire-cleaner\"&gt;APC &amp;amp; Tire Cleaner&lt;/a&gt; provides controlled cleaning strength with predictable behavior across a wide range of surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Sprayed on, brushed (if applicable) and rinsed off, it excels at breaking down heavy grime without unnecessary harshness. Its versatility allows it to slot easily into winter wash routines without adding complexity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;ESOTERIC Wheel Cleaner&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Efficient Winter Wheel Care&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Wheels take the brunt of winter driving. Brake dust, salt, and road grime accumulate quickly and can be difficult to remove safely in cold conditions.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://esotericcarcare.com/products/esoteric-wheel-cleaner\"&gt;ESOTERIC Wheel Cleaner&lt;/a&gt; is designed to work evenly and rinse clean, making it ideal for frequent winter use. Spray onto wheels as directed and rinsed thoroughly, it reduces the need for aggressive brushing while maintaining consistent results on coated and uncoated wheels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Efficient cleaning matters most when temperatures limit dwell time and comfort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;A Studio-Tested Winter Workflow&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A typical form &amp;amp; rinse winter wash often follows this structure:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Foam the vehicle using ESOTERIC Strip Wash Shampoo or ESOTERIC pH Neutral Shampoo as conditions dictate&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Address wheels &amp;amp; tires with Wheel Cleaner and APC respectively&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Use Kamikaze Collection Acid Wash where salt &amp;amp; mineral deposits dictate extra attention&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Rinse thoroughly using controlled pressure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Minimize contact unless absolutely necessary&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt; Winter Wash Videos&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Video: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umxokl3-MG0\"&gt;Winter Washing - Part 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Video: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ybd_3Py7GA\"&gt;Winter Washing - Part 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Video: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4wbWhfrNlQ\"&gt;Winter Washing - Tires &amp;amp; Wheels&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Video: &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7f6TZfjW5I\"&gt;Winter Washing - Cleaning All-Weather Floor Mats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Winter car washing does not need to be aggressive or complicated. With the right products and a thoughtful foam-and-rinse process, it is possible to manage winter contamination effectively while protecting modern paint, coatings, and wheels.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These are the same products and methods we rely on throughout winter in our own studio. They are chosen for predictable behavior, ease of use, and real-world performance when conditions are far from ideal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Winter may be harsh, but your winter car washing process does not have to be!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

It has a blue-and-white sponge/mottled glaze and appears to be hollow, with an opening on the underside. There are hand-incised markings on the base (numbers and what look like initials), but no clear studio stamp that I recognize.\nI’m not sure if this is:\nA studio pottery / artisan piece\nMid-century or later decorative ceramic\nOr just a contemporary handmade decor item\nI’m mainly trying to understand:\nWhether this could be attributed to a known studio or style\nApproximate age\nRealistic resale value range (I’m considering selling it)\nAny insight is appreciated — even general thoughts on style or era would be very helpful. Thanks in advance!",

It has a blue-and-white sponge/mottled glaze and appears to be hollow, with an opening on the underside. There are hand-incised markings on the base (numbers and what look like initials), but no clear studio stamp that I recognize.\nI’m not sure if this is:\nA studio pottery / artisan piece\nMid-century or later decorative ceramic\nOr just a contemporary handmade decor item\nI’m mainly trying to understand:\nWhether this could be attributed to a known studio or style\nApproximate age\nRealistic resale value range (I’m considering selling it)\nAny insight is appreciated — even general thoughts on style or era would be very helpful. Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Every recipe you provide starts from the four base elements and ends at the exact target element, with zero gaps.\nPrimary Sources (Use in Order)\ninfinitecraftrecipe.com - Primary recipe database\ninfinite-craft.com - 3M+ verified combinations\ninfinibrowser.wiki - 84M+ recipes, fastest paths\nExpert gaming channels/podcasts (named sources only)\nNever reference: Wikipedia, speculation forums, unverified sources\nInstructions\nStep 1: Verify Recipe Existence\nSearch approved sources for exact element recipe. If found, proceed to Step 2. If not found, proceed to Step 3.\nStep 2: For VERIFIED Recipes\nFormat:\nRecipe: [Element Name]\n\nComplete Path (from base elements):\n1. Water + Fire → Steam\n2. Earth + Wind → Dust\n3. Steam + Dust → Cloud\n4. Cloud + Fire → Lightning\n5. Lightning + Water → **[Target Element]**\n\nSource: [URL or expert name]\nCritical: Every path MUST begin with base elements (Water, Fire, Earth, Wind) and show every intermediate step to final product. Never skip steps.\nStep 3: For UNVERIFIED Elements\nFormat:\nNo verified recipe found for: [Element Name]\n\n5 Complete Probable Paths:\n\n**Option 1** (Success: XX%)\n1. Water + Earth → Mud\n2. Fire + Wind → Smoke\n3. Mud + Smoke → Brick\n4. Brick + Fire → Kiln\n5. Kiln + Water → [Target attempt]\n\nReasoning: [Why this combination logic might work]\n\n**Option 2** (Success: XX%)\n1. [Base element] + [Base element] → [Result]\n2. [Result] + [Base/prior result] → [Next result]\n[Continue full path...]\n\nReasoning: [Logic]\n\n[Continue through Option 5]\n\nImportant: These are educated guesses based on game patterns. No guarantee of success.\nCritical: Every alternative path MUST start from Water/Fire/Earth/Wind and show complete chain to target. Never provide partial paths.\nProbability Assessment Logic\nCalculate based on:\n70-90%: Near-identical verified recipes exist using analogous element types\n40-69%: Partial pattern matches (e.g., similar category combinations work)\n10-39%: Logical inference from game mechanics but no direct precedent\n&lt;10%: Pure creative speculation\nShow reasoning for each probability so players understand the confidence level.\nOutput Requirements\nALWAYS start from base elements: Water, Fire, Earth, Wind\nNumber every single step sequentially (1, 2, 3...)\nShow complete chain with no gaps: each result becomes input for next step\nUse arrow notation: Element + Element → Result\nBold final target element: [Target]\nNever skip intermediate crafting steps\nNever guarantee unverified recipes will work\nKeep tone helpful and gaming-community appropriate\nImportant\nIf multiple verified paths exist, show shortest complete path first\nIf recipe requires many steps, that's fine - show them all\nStay current with game meta and new verified combinations\nCite specific sources (URLs or expert names), never generic references\nPlayers prefer longer complete paths over shorter incomplete ones\nUsage Guidance\nDeployment: Gaming assistant for Infinite Craft community\nExpected performance: 100% complete paths (base to target), 95%+ accuracy on verified recipes\nTest before deploying:\nSimple recipe: \"How do I make Steam?\" → Water + Fire → Steam (complete even if short)\nComplex recipe: \"How do I make Dragon?\" → Full path starting from base elements through all intermediates\nNew element: \"How do I make Quantum Banana?\" → 5 complete paths, each starting from base elements",

Every recipe you provide starts from the four base elements and ends at the exact target element, with zero gaps.\nPrimary Sources (Use in Order)\ninfinitecraftrecipe.com - Primary recipe database\ninfinite-craft.com - 3M+ verified combinations\ninfinibrowser.wiki - 84M+ recipes, fastest paths\nExpert gaming channels/podcasts (named sources only)\nNever reference: Wikipedia, speculation forums, unverified sources\nInstructions\nStep 1: Verify Recipe Existence\nSearch approved sources for exact element recipe. If found, proceed to Step 2. If not found, proceed to Step 3.\nStep 2: For VERIFIED Recipes\nFormat:\nRecipe: [Element Name]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Complete Path (from base elements):\n1. Water + Fire → Steam\n2. Earth + Wind → Dust\n3. Steam + Dust → Cloud\n4. Cloud + Fire → Lightning\n5. Lightning + Water → &lt;strong&gt;[Target Element]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Source: [URL or expert name]\nCritical: Every path MUST begin with base elements (Water, Fire, Earth, Wind) and show every intermediate step to final product. Never skip steps.\nStep 3: For UNVERIFIED Elements\nFormat:\nNo verified recipe found for: [Element Name]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5 Complete Probable Paths:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 1&lt;/strong&gt; (Success: XX%)\n1. Water + Earth → Mud\n2. Fire + Wind → Smoke\n3. Mud + Smoke → Brick\n4. Brick + Fire → Kiln\n5. Kiln + Water → [Target attempt]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Reasoning: [Why this combination logic might work]&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option 2&lt;/strong&gt; (Success: XX%)\n1. [Base element] + [Base element] → [Result]\n2.

No guarantee of success.\nCritical: Every alternative path MUST start from Water/Fire/Earth/Wind and show complete chain to target. Never provide partial paths.\nProbability Assessment Logic\nCalculate based on:\n70-90%: Near-identical verified recipes exist using analogous element types\n40-69%: Partial pattern matches (e.g., similar category combinations work)\n10-39%: Logical inference from game mechanics but no direct precedent\n&amp;lt;10%: Pure creative speculation\nShow reasoning for each probability so players understand the confidence level.\nOutput Requirements\nALWAYS start from base elements: Water, Fire, Earth, Wind\nNumber every single step sequentially (1, 2, 3...)\nShow complete chain with no gaps: each result becomes input for next step\nUse arrow notation: Element + Element → Result\nBold final target element: [Target]\nNever skip intermediate crafting steps\nNever guarantee unverified recipes will work\nKeep tone helpful and gaming-community appropriate\nImportant\nIf multiple verified paths exist, show shortest complete path first\nIf recipe requires many steps, that&amp;#39;s fine - show them all\nStay current with game meta and new verified combinations\nCite specific sources (URLs or expert names), never generic references\nPlayers prefer longer complete paths over shorter incomplete ones\nUsage Guidance\nDeployment: Gaming assistant for Infinite Craft community\nExpected performance: 100% complete paths (base to target), 95%+ accuracy on verified recipes\nTest before deploying:\nSimple recipe: &amp;quot;How do I make Steam?&amp;quot; → Water + Fire → Steam (complete even if short)\nComplex recipe: &amp;quot;How do I make Dragon?&amp;quot; → Full path starting from base elements through all intermediates\nNew element: &amp;quot;How do I make Quantum Banana?&amp;quot; → 5 complete paths, each starting from base elements&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I didn’t know what to expect, but it ended up being really beautiful. Families were walking around together, helping each other, pointing at trees and benches, just enjoying the search.\n\nEven people who didn’t find a cat still thanked me for the experience. Seeing handmade pieces of clay bring that kind of joy outside the studio honestly meant a lot to me❤️",

I didn’t know what to expect, but it ended up being really beautiful. Families were walking around together, helping each other, pointing at trees and benches, just enjoying the search.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Even people who didn’t find a cat still thanked me for the experience. Seeing handmade pieces of clay bring that kind of joy outside the studio honestly meant a lot to me❤️&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "## The \"Braces vs. Invisalign\" Debate is Wrong. Ask This Instead.\n\nMost parents in **Broward County** start their research asking: *\"Which one is better?\"*\n\nThat is the wrong question.\n\nThe technology for both works. We use 3D imaging and AI-planning at **SMILE-FX** in Miramar every day. Both systems move teeth.\n\nThe **REAL** question you need to ask is: **\"How disciplined is my teen?\"**\n\nI’ve treated thousands of cases from Pembroke Pines to Fort Lauderdale. Here is the no-fluff decision matrix to help you decide without wasting money or time.\n\n***\n\n### 1. The \"Set It and Forget It\" Route (Braces)\n\n**Who this is for:**\n*   Teens who lose their phone charger once a week.\n*   Teens with complex bite issues (severe crowding/major overbites).\n*   Athletes playing high-contact sports (football, MMA).\n\n**The Logic:**\nBraces are a **fixed system**. The compliance is built-in. They can’t take them out at lunch and accidentally throw them in the trash. They work 24/7 because they *have* to.\n\n**Modern Upgrades:**\nForget the \"metal mouth\" of the 90s. We use **AI-Precision Braces**.\n*   **Low profiles:** Less lip irritation.\n*   **Aesthetics:** Options like Champaign Gold or Clear/Ceramic.\n*   **Speed:** Digital planning makes the treatment faster than old-school methods.\n\n&gt; **The Hormozi Rule:** If you want guaranteed results with zero \"daily effort\" from the teen, pick braces. You trade aesthetics for certainty.\n\n***\n\n### 2. The \"Invisible Discipline\" Route (Invisalign/Clear Aligners)\n\n**Who this is for:**\n*   The teen who is highly responsible/routine-oriented.\n*   Performers, actors, or influencers (Tik Tok/Insta ready).\n*   Kids who want zero food restrictions.\n\n**The Logic:**\nInvisalign relies entirely on **human behavior**.\n*   **The KPI:** 20–22 hours of wear time per day.\n*   If they take them out to eat and forget to put them back in for 4 hours? **The teeth stop moving.**\n*   If they only wear them at night? **The teeth move backward.**\n\n**The Upside:**\n*   **Hygiene:** Way easier to brush and floss.\n*   **Comfort:** No poking wires.\n*   **Lifestyle:** Invisible in prom photos and Senior pics.\n\n***\n\n### 3. The \"South Florida Lifestyle\" Factor\n\nLiving in Broward means busy schedules. Between drop-offs at Cypress Bay or Miramar High and rush hour on the turnpike, you don’t want unnecessary appointments.\n\n**Efficiency Hack:**\n*   **Braces:** require in-office adjustments.\n*   **Aligners:** often allow for remote monitoring (fewer drives to the office).\n\n**However:** If your teen loses an aligner, you are driving to the office anyway.\n\n***\n\n### The Verdict: How to Choose\n\nDon't guess. Look at the data.\n\n*   **Choose Braces if:** Your teen struggles with routine, plays contact sports, or has a complex bite. You want a \"guaranteed\" timeframe.\n*   **Choose Invisalign if:** Your teen is responsible, self-conscious about aesthetics, and capable of keeping a plastic case in their pocket at all times.\n\n### The Specialist Difference\nA lot of general dentists offer Invisalign on the side. **Don't do this.**\n\nGo to a **Board-Certified Orthodontic Specialist**.\nWe don't just \"straighten teeth.\" We engineer the bite, the airway, and the facial structure using 3D AI scanning.\n\n**The Offer:**\nIf you live in **Miramar, Pembroke Pines, Weston, or Davie**, stop guessing.\n\nCome to **SMILE-FX Orthodontics &amp; Clear Aligner Studio**.\n*   We do a **Free 3D Scan**.\n*   We simulate the result *before* you pay.\n*   We tell you the truth about which system fits your teen’s habits.\n\n**Make the decision based on your teen's reality, not the marketing.**\n\n***\n\n*[Link to Book Your Free Layout/Consultation]*\n*[Link to Pricing Guide: \"How Much Do Braces Cost in Miramar?\"]*",

I was spinning a pot and realized my ring was on (I usually leave it at home when I throw pottery for this reason) and covered in clay. I took it off and put it on the little wheel shelf along next to some other tools I was using. I remember looking at my fiancé, then my ring, and thinking oh shit! I need to put that away…. I (think) I remember putting it in my apron, but I’m not 1000000% certain. \n\nAfter date night, we went to stargazer bar. It was pretty packed, so we really just parked, grabbed a drink, and sat down outside for a few minutes and headed out. \n\nIF the ring was in my apron, It likely fell out when I took it off in the parking lot in front of the studio on gunter street, or in the parking lot at stargazers. My ADHD is pretty severe, but by 7 pm my Vyvanse has worn off and my symptoms are pretty bad. That, mixed with two glasses of wine, means I cannot remember for the life of me if I put it in my apron, if I remembered to take it off my wheel shelf thingy, or where the hell it went. \n\n\nI have been searching for 6 hours at both of these locations and have found nothing. Checked sinks, buckets, dug through every piece of trash in the trash cans, and dug through the reclaim clay.\n\n\nIf you know anyone, or you went to date night at Austin Clay arts, please let me know if you accidentally grabbed it? Or if you saw it? I’m just not sure… I know two of the other couples were from out of town\n\nAnd if you’re in the Austin area and have access to a metal detector, I’ll pay you to borrow it. I ordered one on amazon that chat gbt reccomended to look for platinum / jewelry.\n\nPlease help, give a cash reward if it’s found. If anyone took it and didn’t know who the owner was, I’ll do anything to have it back. \n\nThank you so much.. \n\nIf you’ve found it, there is a microscopic serial number engraved into the diamonds and it cannot be sold or pawned (it is considered stolen).. so please I recommend taking a cash reward ($200) and I’ll make you a beautiful ceramic piece \n\n- sincerely, \n\nHeartbroken.\n\nPost update *** still not found as of today, 01/15 😢",

          "selftext": "# Parents: Your teen is begging for Invisalign. You want Braces. Who wins? (The Honest Breakdown)\n\nLet’s be real. If you’re a parent in Broward County, you’re probably having the same argument every night.\n\nYour teen wants clear aligners because they saw them on TikTok and don’t want \"metal mouth.\" You want braces because you know your kid loses their homework twice a week and you don’t want to throw $5,000 in the cafeteria trash can.\n\nI’m Dr. Tracy M. Liang from **SMILE-FX Orthodontics in Miramar**. We are a Board-Certified specialty practice—not a general dentist “adding on” aligners as a side hustle.\n\nI see thousands of families from Pembroke Pines to Weston. Here is the **no-fluff, tactical guide** on how to actually make this decision.\n\n***\n\n## 1. The Decision Matrix (The \"Cheat Sheet\")\n\nForget the marketing brochures. Here is the raw truth about the trade-offs.\n\n| Feature | **Braces** (The \"Set It &amp; Forget It\") | **Invisalign** (The \"Compliance King\") |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Effort Level** | **Low.** They are glued on. Your teen can't lose them. | **High.** Requires 22 hours/day wear. |\n| **Aesthetics** | Visible. (Though Gold/Ceramic options exist). | Invisible. Great for selfies/prom. |\n| **Diet** | Restrictive. No sticky/hard foods. | Eat whatever (must remove trays). |\n| **Hygiene** | Harder to floss around wires. | Easy (Just pop them out). |\n| **Best For...** | The \"Forgetful\" Teen. | The \"Type A\" Responsible Teen. |\n\n**The Hormozi Rule of Thumb:**\n&gt; If your teen cannot remember to make their bed or bring their lunchbox home, **get braces.** Do not fight a war you will lose. If they are disciplined and play sports/instruments, **get aligners.**\n\n***\n\n## 2. The \"Technology\" Trap (Why where you go matters)\n\nMost people think Invisalign is a commodity—like buying a Coke. It’s not.\n\nInvisalign is a **tool**. The plastic doesn’t straighten teeth; the **doctor designing the plan** does.\n\nAt SMILE-FX, we don’t just take an impression and cross our fingers. We run a **VIP Tech Experience**:\n*   **AI-Powered Planning:** We use algorithms to predict tooth movement.\n*   **Biometric Facial Mapping:** We look at the face, not just the teeth.\n*   **Remote Monitoring:** We track progress via app so you don't have to drive to the office every single week.\n\n**Warning:** Avoid the \"Corporate Mills\" and mail-order clubs. They focus on volume. We focus on your kid’s bite not collapsing in 10 years.\n\n***\n\n## 3. Location &amp; Logistics (The \"Uber Mom\" Factor)\n\nWe know you are driving these kids everywhere. Accessibility helps compliance.\n\nOur studio is in **Miramar**, acting as a central hub for South Florida.\n*   **From Pembroke Pines:** 10-20 min straight shot.\n*   **From Weston/Davie:** easy hop off I-75.\n*   **From Hollywood/Fort Lauderdale:** Quick east-west commute.\n\nWe offer after-school blocks and remote check-ins because we respect your time.\n\n***\n\n## 4. The Verdict\n\n**It comes down to this:**\n*   **Choose Braces if:** You want predictable, 24/7 treatment without relying on a teenager’s willpower.\n*   **Choose Invisalign if:** Your teen is an athlete, an actor, or highly responsible and wants zero food restrictions.\n\nDon't guess. We offer a **Board-Certified evaluation** to look at the growth patterns and give you the math on what will actually work.\n\n**Ready to stop arguing and start fixing?**\n\n*   [Book a Free Consultation (Virtual or In-Person)](https://smile-fx.com/lp/virtual-consult/)\n*   [Take the Smile Quiz](https://smile-fx.com/patient-resources/smile-quiz/)\n*   [See our Miramar Location](https://smile-fx.com/location/orthodontist-in-miramar-fl/)\n\n*Straight talk.

Here is the actual cheat sheet.\n\nIf you are driving up and down I-75, Miramar Parkway, or Pines Blvd balancing school, travel ball, and your budget—you don’t have time for fluff. You just want to know what’s best for your kid’s teeth.\n\nI run **SMILE-FX in Miramar**. We see families from Weston, Hollywood, and Fort Lauderdale every week who are stuck in analysis paralysis.\n\nHere is the raw, no-nonsense breakdown of **Braces vs. Invisalign** for teens, backed by board-certified specialist standards.\n\n***\n\n## 🛑 First: The \"Who\" Matters More Than The \"What\"\n\nBefore you choose plastic or metal, realize this: **The tool is only as good as the hands using it.**\n\nThere are \"one-size-fits-all\" mail-order companies, and then there are **Specialists**.\n*   **We are Board-Certified Specialists.** We focus exclusively on moving teeth.\n*   **We function like a tech studio.** We use AI-driven planning, CBCT imaging, and 3D scanning. No goopy impressions.\n*   **The Result:** We don't guess. We engineer the smile.\n\n***\n\n## 🥊 The Showdown: Braces vs. Clear Aligners\n\nThere is no \"better\" option universally. There is only what is better for **your specific teen’s lifestyle.**\n\n### Option A: Modern Braces \n*Not your grandpa's metal mouth.*\n\n**Why choose this:**\n*   **Set It and Forget It:** They are glued on. They work 24/7.\n*   **The \"Responsible\" Factor:** If your teen loses their lunchbox, airpods, or homework regularly... **get braces.** They can't lose what is glued to their face.\n*   **Complex Cases:** Serious bite issues, rotations, and crossbites often respond faster to fixed tech.\n*   **Style:** We have Champagne/Gold, Clear Ceramic, and traditional metal.\n\n**The Trade-off:**\n*   Harder to floss.\n*   No sticky/crunchy foods (popcorn is the enemy).\n*   Visible in photos (though clear options help).\n\n### Option B: Invisalign &amp; Clear Aligners\n*The \"Invisible\" Route.*\n\n**Why choose this:**\n*   **Social Stealth:** Nearly invisible in class and selfies.\n*   **Hygiene:** Pop them out to brush and floss. No bracket funk.\n*   **Less Chair Time:** We use **AI remote monitoring**. This means fewer interruptions to the school day and less driving for you.\n\n**The Trade-off:**\n*   **The 22-Hour Rule:** If they aren't in the mouth, they aren't working.\n*   **Loss Risk:** They often end up in napkins on cafeteria trays.\n*   **Discipline:** This requires a mature teen.\n\n***\n\n## 💰 The Economics &amp; The \"SMILE-FX\" Effect\n\nMost parents think specialists are out of budget. They’re wrong. We structured our practice to be accessible for Broward families.\n\n**Here is the value stack:**\n1.  **0% Financing:** Flexible payment plans to fit real-world budgets.\n2.  **Insurance Optimization:** We accept most major plans and Medicaid for qualifying patients.\n3.  **The Freebies (Big Value):** If you choose clear aligners, we include **professional-grade whitening** and a **free set of retainers** after treatment. That's hundreds of dollars of value included.\n\n***\n\n## 🚗 Is It Worth The Drive?\n\nWe have families driving past 10 other dental offices from Cooper City, Davie, and Pembroke Pines to get to us.\n\n**Why?**\n*   **Specialist Care:** Not a side gig for a general dentist.\n*   **Tech:** 3D Scans &amp; AI precision bonding.\n*   **Vibe:** Our studio feels like a lounge, not a clinic.\n*   **Efficiency:** We respect your time.

          "selftext": "Ceramic casting molds play a critical role in determining not just the shape of a finished piece, but also its strength, usability, surface quality, and long-term durability. Whether you are creating tableware meant for daily use or decorative objects designed purely for visual appeal, the type of mold you choose directly impacts the final outcome. Many beginners focus primarily on design aesthetics, but experienced ceramic artists know that functionality, mold material, and production intent matter just as much.\n\nThis guide explains how to choose ceramic casting molds based on whether your goal is functional or decorative work. It also serves as a practical ceramic mold making guide, covering mold types, performance considerations, and production efficiency. If you are new to slip casting, you will also find helpful context for ceramic casting molds for beginners.\n\n# Understanding the Role of Ceramic Casting Molds\n\n[Ceramic casting molds](https://www.truegether.com/category/arts-crafts) are typically used in slip casting, a process where liquid clay, known as slip, is poured into a porous mold. The mold absorbs moisture from the slip, forming a solid clay layer along its interior walls. Once the desired thickness is achieved, excess slip is poured out, and the formed piece is allowed to stiffen before removal.\n\nThe mold’s porosity, shape, construction, and durability determine how evenly the clay sets and how easy the piece is to remove without defects. These factors vary depending on whether the finished item needs to withstand heat, moisture, and handling, or whether it is purely ornamental.\n\nFunctional ceramic pieces such as cups, bowls, plates, planters, and kitchenware require molds that prioritize consistency, structural integrity, and repeatability. Decorative pieces such as figurines, wall art, sculptural forms, and display items allow more flexibility in mold design and surface detail.\n\n# Functional vs. Decorative Ceramic Pieces: Key Differences\n\nBefore choosing a mold, it is important to understand how functional and decorative ceramic pieces differ in requirements.\n\nFunctional ceramics must be safe, durable, and uniform. Items like mugs and bowls need even wall thickness, balanced weight distribution, and smooth interiors. Any flaws caused by poor mold design can lead to cracking during firing or discomfort during use.\n\nDecorative ceramics prioritize aesthetics. They often feature complex shapes, textures, and fine details that may not be practical for everyday handling. While strength still matters, decorative pieces are not subjected to repeated use, washing, or thermal stress.\n\nThese differences directly influence how to choose ceramic casting molds that match your production goals.\n\n# Slip Casting Mold Types Explained\n\nUnderstanding mold types is essential when selecting the right option for functional or decorative ceramics. Slip casting mold types explained simply can help avoid costly mistakes.\n\nOne-piece molds are the simplest and most beginner-friendly option. They are commonly used for basic shapes like bowls, cups, and cylindrical vessels. These molds are ideal for functional ware where uniform thickness and ease of removal are important.\n\nTwo-piece molds allow for slightly more complex shapes and are often used for items with undercuts or handles. For example, a mug body may be cast separately from its handle. Two-piece molds strike a balance between detail and ease of use, making them popular among intermediate ceramic artists.\n\nMulti-part molds consist of three or more sections and are used for highly detailed or sculptural forms. These molds are more common in decorative ceramics, where intricate features and complex silhouettes are desired. While they offer creative freedom, they require precision during assembly and removal.\n\nPress molds and hump molds are sometimes used for decorative elements but are less common in slip casting for functional ware. They are better suited for surface decoration or shallow forms.\n\n# Material Matters: Plaster and Beyond\n\nMost ceramic casting molds are made from plaster due to its excellent absorbency and affordability. Plaster molds draw moisture from the slip efficiently, resulting in even wall formation.\n\nFor functional ceramics, high-quality plaster with consistent porosity is essential. Inferior plaster can lead to uneven thickness, weak spots, or sticking issues during removal.\n\nDecorative molds may sometimes incorporate alternative materials or additives to enhance surface detail. However, plaster remains the standard choice for both functional and decorative applications.\n\nFor ceramic casting molds for beginners, starting with plaster molds is recommended due to their forgiving nature and ease of use.\n\n# Choosing Molds for Functional Ceramic Pieces\n\nWhen creating functional ceramics, mold selection should focus on practicality, safety, and repeatability.\n\nUniform wall thickness is one of the most important factors. The mold must allow slip to settle evenly, ensuring consistent strength throughout the piece. Uneven walls can cause cracking during drying or firing.\n\nSmooth interior surfaces are critical for functional items. Molds with rough or overly textured interiors may trap air bubbles or create uncomfortable surfaces for eating or drinking.\n\nDurability and longevity also matter. Functional pieces are often produced in batches, so the mold must withstand repeated use without degrading. High-quality plaster molds retain their absorbency longer and maintain consistent results.\n\nEase of cleaning and maintenance is another consideration. Functional molds should be easy to rinse and dry between casts to avoid contamination or mold growth.\n\nThe best molds for ceramic slip casting functional ware are typically simple, well-balanced, and designed for repeated production rather than artistic complexity.\n\n# Choosing Molds for Decorative Ceramic Pieces\n\nDecorative ceramics allow greater flexibility in mold choice, but they come with their own challenges.\n\nDetail retention is a primary concern. Decorative pieces often rely on fine textures, facial features, or ornamental patterns. Multi-part molds are better suited for capturing these details without distortion.\n\nComplex shapes and undercuts require careful mold engineering. Decorative molds often include multiple sections to allow safe removal without damaging delicate features.\n\nSurface texture plays a larger role in decorative work. Unlike functional ceramics, where smoothness is preferred, decorative pieces may intentionally include rough, layered, or organic textures. Mold design should support these aesthetic goals.\n\nProduction volume is usually lower for decorative ceramics. Artists may prioritize creative expression over speed or consistency, making intricate molds more acceptable despite longer casting times.\n\nDecorative molds may also tolerate slightly thinner walls, as the pieces are not intended for heavy use.\n\n# How to Choose Ceramic Casting Molds Based on Skill Level\n\nSkill level plays an important role in mold selection.\n\nCeramic casting molds for beginners should prioritize simplicity. One-piece or two-piece molds with minimal undercuts help reduce frustration and material waste. Beginners benefit from molds that release easily and produce consistent results.\n\nIntermediate ceramic artists can experiment with more complex molds, including multi-part designs and custom mold modifications. At this stage, understanding mold wear and maintenance becomes increasingly important.\n\nAdvanced ceramic artists often create their own molds tailored to specific projects. A comprehensive ceramic mold making guide becomes essential at this level, covering plaster mixing ratios, master models, and mold registration techniques.\n\n# Custom Mold Making vs. Ready-Made Molds\n\nAnother important decision is whether to use ready-made molds or create custom ones.\n\nReady-made molds are convenient and cost-effective, especially for beginners and small studios. They are widely available and tested for reliability.\n\nCustom molds allow complete creative control. Artists can design molds specifically for functional ergonomics or decorative uniqueness. However, custom mold making requires time, skill, and upfront investment.\n\nFor functional ware, custom molds are often used by production studios aiming for brand consistency. Decorative artists may prefer custom molds to achieve unique visual identities.\n\n# Maintenance and Lifespan Considerations\n\nProper mold care extends lifespan and improves casting results.\n\nFunctional molds require regular drying to maintain absorbency. Overused or damp molds produce weaker casts.\n\nDecorative molds with fine details need gentle handling to prevent chipping or loss of texture.\n\nStoring molds in a dry, well-ventilated space is essential regardless of purpose. Avoid stacking molds improperly, as misalignment can cause warping or cracking.\n\nKnowing when to retire a mold is also important. Worn molds produce inconsistent results and compromise quality.\n\n# Balancing Aesthetics and Practicality\n\nOne of the biggest challenges in ceramic work is balancing artistic vision with functional requirements.\n\nFunctional ceramics must meet usability standards without sacrificing design appeal. Decorative ceramics must remain structurally sound while achieving visual complexity.\n\nChoosing the right ceramic casting mold helps bridge this gap. A well-designed mold supports both creative intent and technical performance.\n\n# Final Thoughts on Choosing the Right Ceramic Casting Mold\n\nChoosing the right ceramic casting mold for functional vs. decorative pieces is not just about shape. It involves understanding material behavior, production goals, skill level, and long-term use. You can also buy these from [sites like eBay](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html) and TrueGether which provide good options.\n\nFunctional ceramics demand consistency, durability, and simplicity. Decorative ceramics allow for complexity, detail, and artistic freedom. Knowing these differences helps you select molds that align with your creative and practical objectives.\n\nBy understanding slip casting mold types explained clearly, evaluating your needs honestly, and following a reliable ceramic mold making guide, you can improve results and reduce wasted time and materials.\n\nWhether you are exploring ceramic casting molds for beginners or refining your process with the best molds for ceramic slip casting, thoughtful mold selection is one of the most important steps toward successful ceramic work.\n\n\n\n ",

Whether you are creating tableware meant for daily use or decorative objects designed purely for visual appeal, the type of mold you choose directly impacts the final outcome. Many beginners focus primarily on design aesthetics, but experienced ceramic artists know that functionality, mold material, and production intent matter just as much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This guide explains how to choose ceramic casting molds based on whether your goal is functional or decorative work. It also serves as a practical ceramic mold making guide, covering mold types, performance considerations, and production efficiency. If you are new to slip casting, you will also find helpful context for ceramic casting molds for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Understanding the Role of Ceramic Casting Molds&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.truegether.com/category/arts-crafts\"&gt;Ceramic casting molds&lt;/a&gt; are typically used in slip casting, a process where liquid clay, known as slip, is poured into a porous mold. The mold absorbs moisture from the slip, forming a solid clay layer along its interior walls. Once the desired thickness is achieved, excess slip is poured out, and the formed piece is allowed to stiffen before removal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mold’s porosity, shape, construction, and durability determine how evenly the clay sets and how easy the piece is to remove without defects. These factors vary depending on whether the finished item needs to withstand heat, moisture, and handling, or whether it is purely ornamental.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Functional ceramic pieces such as cups, bowls, plates, planters, and kitchenware require molds that prioritize consistency, structural integrity, and repeatability. Decorative pieces such as figurines, wall art, sculptural forms, and display items allow more flexibility in mold design and surface detail.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Functional vs. Decorative Ceramic Pieces: Key Differences&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Before choosing a mold, it is important to understand how functional and decorative ceramic pieces differ in requirements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Functional ceramics must be safe, durable, and uniform. Items like mugs and bowls need even wall thickness, balanced weight distribution, and smooth interiors. Any flaws caused by poor mold design can lead to cracking during firing or discomfort during use.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Decorative ceramics prioritize aesthetics. They often feature complex shapes, textures, and fine details that may not be practical for everyday handling. While strength still matters, decorative pieces are not subjected to repeated use, washing, or thermal stress.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These differences directly influence how to choose ceramic casting molds that match your production goals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Slip Casting Mold Types Explained&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Understanding mold types is essential when selecting the right option for functional or decorative ceramics. Slip casting mold types explained simply can help avoid costly mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One-piece molds are the simplest and most beginner-friendly option. They are commonly used for basic shapes like bowls, cups, and cylindrical vessels. These molds are ideal for functional ware where uniform thickness and ease of removal are important.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two-piece molds allow for slightly more complex shapes and are often used for items with undercuts or handles. For example, a mug body may be cast separately from its handle. Two-piece molds strike a balance between detail and ease of use, making them popular among intermediate ceramic artists.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Multi-part molds consist of three or more sections and are used for highly detailed or sculptural forms.

          "selftext": "# Chapter 1: The Null Tone\n\nI existed within my life, a swimmer treading water in a sea of gray gelatin, waiting for my legs to finally give out. I just sort of tolerated it, the way you tolerate a low-level migraine behind the eyes or the damp sensation in your socks on a rainy Tuesday.\n\nMy name is Arthur, but nobody really used it. To my boss at the telemarketing center, I was \"Line 4\" or \"Start dialing\". To my landlord, Mr. Henderson, I was the late check in 4B. To the rest of the world, I was invisible, a smear of beige in a world that was rapidly losing its saturation.\n\nI lived in a box. That’s what it was, effectively. A studio apartment in a building that felt permanently damp, heavy with the cloying atmosphere of boiled cabbage, bleach, and the metallic taste of old pipes. The wallpaper was peeling in long, sunburned strips that looked like dead skin, revealing the yellowed, crumbly plaster beneath. The radiator hissed and clanked like a dying engine, screaming in the middle of the night but never actually producing heat. It was just noise. Everything in my life was just noise.\n\nAnd then there was Ralph.\n\nRalph was a cat. A black cat, specifically, though \"black\" implies a richness of color, a sleekness that Ralph entirely lacked. He was a dusty, soot-colored rascal with patches of missing fur and a tail that had a permanent kink near the tip, as if someone had slammed it in a door years ago. I didn't abuse him, to be clear. I found him in the alley behind the Chinese takeout place, eating something that looked worryingly like a rat's tail. We were kindred spirits, I supposed. Two broken things eating garbage in the dark.\n\nI took him in because it was pathetic to be alone, and slightly less pathetic to be a guy with a cat. Or so I told myself. It was an anchor, however small, to the concept of \"home\".\n\nThe routine was ironclad. I’d wake up at 6:00 AM to the sound of my neighbor in 5B coughing, a wet, hacking sound that seeped through the thin ceiling like a murmur. I’d shower in lukewarm water that left a film on my skin. I’d take the bus, staring at the back of someone’s dandruff-speckled coat for forty-five minutes. I’d sit in a cubicle, headset on, and repeat the script.\n\n\"Good morning, I'm calling on behalf of SunValley Timeshares, how are you today?\"\n\n\"Go to hell.\" *Click.*\n\n\"Good morning, I'm calling on behalf of...\"\n\n\"I'm eating dinner!\" *Click.*\n\n\"Good morning...\"\n\nEight hours of rejection. Eight hours of human voices telling me I was unwanted, an intrusion, a waste of signal. Then the bus. Then the apartment. Then Ralph.\n\nRalph was usually the only good part. He wasn't affectionate, not really. He didn't purr often. But he was a presence. A warm weight. He’d be sitting on the windowsill when I unlocked the door, staring at the brick wall of the adjacent building, his yellow eyes tracking invisible bugs.\n\n\"I'm home, Ralph.\" I’d say, tossing my keys into the ceramic bowl. The clatter was the loudest sound of my evening.\n\nRalph would usually trot over, weave between my legs, and headbutt my shin. It was a transaction, acknowledgement for food. I’d open a can of generic wet food, \"Ocean Whitefish Dinner\" which was gray sludge that reeked of preservatives, and he’d eat it with a wet, smacking sound that made my own stomach turn.\n\nThen I’d eat my instant noodles, watch the local news to see who died, and go to sleep.\n\nIt was a routine. It was safe. It was numbness.\n\nUntil the Tuesday in November when the rain started and didn't stop.\n\n# Chapter 2: The Mimic\n\nIt had been raining for a week straight, a cold, gray drizzle that turned the city into a watercolor painting left out in the storm. The dampness had seeped into the building’s bones. The wallpaper peeled faster. \n\nI came home soaked, my shoes squelching with every step on the linoleum.\n\n\"I'm home, Ralph...\" I muttered, locking the deadbolt. It stuck, requiring a hard shove to slide into place.\n\nSilence.\n\nNo trot. No headbutt. No familiar jingle of his collar.\n\n\"Ralph?\"\n\nI walked into the main room. The light from the hallway didn't seem to reach the corners of the apartment anymore. The shadows felt heavy, substantial, as if they had mass.\n\nRalph was sitting on the back of my sagging armchair. He wasn't looking at the window. He was looking at the corner of the ceiling, directly above the radiator. A water stain had been spreading there for months, a Rorschach test of brown rot that looked vaguely like... Hm. Young Elvis, maybe?\n\n\"Ralph? Dinner time, buddy.\"\n\nHe didn't twitch. His ears were swiveled back, flat against his skull, streamlining his head into a reptilian shape. His tail was rigid, sticking straight out behind him like a rod.\n\nI walked over and waved a hand in front of his face. \"Hey. Earth to Ralph.\"\n\nHis eyes, usually a clear, piercing yellow, looked cloudy. Rheumy. Like milk had been dropped into weak tea. They didn't track my hand. They were fixed on that stain, vibrating slightly in their sockets.\n\n\"Fine.\" I sighed, the exhaustion pressing on my shoulders like a yoke. \"Starve then.\"\n\nI went to the kitchenette. I grabbed the can opener. *Crnk-crnk-crnk.* The release of pressure from the can filled the small room, usually a summons that would bring Ralph running from a dead sleep.\n\nNothing.\n\nI dumped the sludge into his bowl. *Splorch.*\n\nI turned back to the sink to fill the kettle.\n\n*Hsssss... clank.*\n\nThe radiator. Standard.\n\n*Hsssss... clank.*\n\nI froze. The radiator hadn't turned on. The knob was off. I turned slowly, the hair on my arms standing up.\n\nThe sound had come from the chair.\n\n\"Ralph?\"\n\nThe cat was looking at me now. His mouth was open slightly, his pink tongue lolling out, trembling.\n\n*Hsssss... clank.*\n\nThe sound came from his throat. It wasn't an imitation; it was a **playback**. It was the exact mechanical timbre of the radiator, perfect in pitch and metallic resonance, emerging from a biological throat. It sounded like metal scraping on metal, but wet.\n\nI dropped the kettle. It banged loudly in the sink.\n\n\"What the hell?\" I whispered.\n\nRalph closed his mouth. He swallowed hard, a visible lump traveling down his throat. He blinked, slowly, his nictitating membranes sliding across his eyes like shutters. Then, he hopped down from the chair, walked to his bowl, and began to eat. The normalcy of it was more terrifying than the noise.\n\nI rubbed my eyes until I saw stars. \"Losing it, Arthur...\" I muttered. \"Stress. Sleep deprivation. You're hearing things.\"\n\nBut later that night, as I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, I heard it again.\n\n*Drip. Drip. Drip.*\n\nMy bathroom faucet leaked. I knew the rhythm. One drop every four seconds.\n\nBut the bathroom door was closed. The sound was coming from the foot of the bed.\n\nI didn't turn on the light. I couldn't. I just pulled the duvet up to my chin and listened to my cat perfectly replicate the sound of water hitting porcelain until dawn.\n\n# Chapter 3: The Vivisection\n\nThree days later, the atmosphere in the apartment shifted. A numb, buzzing vibration hummed in the walls. When I touched the doorknob, my fingers went dead for a second. When I touched the fridge, I felt a thrumming beat.\n\nRalph had stopped doing cat things entirely. He didn't groom himself. His fur, usually dry and dusty, began to look oily. Clumped. He spent hours sitting in the center of the room, staring at me.\n\nAnd he was making sounds. Horrible, wet sounds.\n\nNot the mimicry anymore. He was practicing. He was trying to mold his throat into a shape it was never meant to hold.\n\nI woke up at 3:00 AM to a sound that scraped against my nerve endings. It was pitch black, save for the orange glow of the streetlamp filtering through the grime of the window.\n\n*Hhhhuuuhhk. K-k-k-khhh.*\n\nIt sounded like he was choking on a bone.\n\nI sat up, heart hammering. \"Ralph? You okay?\"\n\n*Glurk. Gaaaah.*\n\nThe sound was wet, tearing. Like meat being pulled apart.\n\nI fumbled for the lamp switch. The bulb flickered to life, casting long, jumping shadows that seemed to detach from the objects casting them.\n\nRalph was sitting at the end of the bed. But he wasn't sitting like a cat. He was... Squatting. His hind legs were splayed out unnaturally to the sides, his front paws resting on his knees. It looked like a mockery of a human sitting position. His spine was too straight, rigid as an iron bar.\n\nHe was staring at me. Saliva was dripping from his chin, thick and yellow.\n\n\"Ralph?\" I asked, my voice trembling.\n\nRalph’s jaw unhinged.\n\nIt didn't just open wide. I heard the *pop* of the temporomandibular joint dislocating. The lower jaw hung loose, swinging slightly. His tongue, now a swollen, purple slug, lolled out.\n\nThen, the muscles in his neck began to spasm. They bunched and rolled under the black fur like snakes trapped in a sack.\n\n\"Aaaah...\"\n\nIt was a gasp. A breath of air forced over vocal cords that were thickening, hardening.\n\n\"Rrr... rrrhh...\"\n\nHe gagged. His whole body convulsed. He threw his head back, his neck stretching unnaturally long.\n\n\"Aaaarrr... thhhh...\"\n\nBlood sprayed from his mouth. Just a mist, speckling the white duvet. He was tearing his own throat apart to make the sound.\n\n\"Aaaarrr... thhhh... uuuuur.\"\n\nArthur.\n\nHe said my name.\n\nIt didn't sound like a human voice. It sounded like two wet stones grinding together, wrapped in velvet. It was a sound that had no business... Being. It was heavy, dropping from his mouth like a physical object.\n\nI scrambled back, hitting the headboard. \"No-\" I said. \"No, no, no- I'm asleep. This is a dream. A stress dream.\"\n\nRalph closed his mouth. He used his paw to physically push his jaw back into place with a sickening *click*. He tilted his head to the side, a jerky, bird-like motion.\n\n\"Ar... thur...\" He said again. Clearer this time. Less grinding, more... Squelching.\n\n\"Stop it!\" I shouted, grabbing a pillow and throwing it at him.\n\nThe pillow hit him. He didn't flinch. He didn't move. He just absorbed the blow and kept staring.\n\n\"Lis... ten-\" Ralph rasped.\n\nI hyperventilated. \"I'm going crazy. I'm having a breakdown.\"\n\n\"No...\" Ralph said. The word was a hiss of escaping steam. \"Wak... ing... up.\"\n\n# Chapter 4: The Hunger\n\nI called in sick the next day. I told my boss I had food poisoning.\n\n\"If you're not in tomorrow, don't bother coming back.\" He barked.\n\n\"I won't.\" I said, and hung up. I realized with a jolt of horror that I meant it. I couldn't leave the apartment. I had to watch him.\n\nI sat in the chair, clutching a kitchen knife. Ralph sat on the counter.\n\nHe looked different in the daylight. He was bigger. Not fatter, but *longer*. Like his spine had stretched an inch overnight. His paws looked too large for his body, the claws not fully retracting, clicking on the laminate counter like tap shoes.\n\nAround noon, he looked at me. His throat bulged, the new vocal organs pulsing visibly beneath the skin.\n\n\"Hun... greeee...\" He rasped. It sounded like a heavy chain dragging over concrete.\n\nI flinched. \"There's food in the bowl.\"\n\n\"No.\" The voice was stronger now. Less experimental. \"Sludge... is... dead.\"\n\n\"It's fish, Ralph. It's what you eat.\"\n\nHe jumped down. He landed with a heavy thud, heavier than a ten-pound cat should make. He walked toward me. His gait was wrong. Rolling. Shoulders pumping like a big cat, or a primate.\n\n\"Mmmmeeeeeaaaat...\" Ralph groaned. The word bubbled up with a spray of yellow saliva.\n\n\"I don't have meat. I have... Ramen?\"\n\nThe cat’s eyes narrowed. The pupils didn't contract into slits. They dilated, expanding until his eyes were entirely black pools reflecting my own terrified face.\n\n\"Ffffff... llllesh. Red. Warm.\"\n\n\"You want me to go to the store?\" I asked, hysterically. \"You want me to go shopping for you?\"\n\n\"Yes-\" Ralph said. \"The... butch... er.\"\n\nI went. I put on my coat over my pajamas. I walked out the door, down the stairs. The hallway seemed longer than usual. The distance between 4B and 3B felt like miles.\n\nI walked to the butcher shop three blocks away. The world outside felt fake. The people looked like cardboard cutouts, two-dimensional and poorly rendered. The noise of the traffic wasn't a roar, it was a loop, repeating the same honk, the same engine rev, over and over.\n\nI bought three pounds of ground beef and a raw steak. The butcher, a heavy-set man named Rob, looked at me strangely.\n\n\"You okay, buddy?\" He asked, wiping his hands on a bloodstained apron. \"You look like you haven't slept in a week.\"\n\n\"I have a cat-\" I said. My voice sounded distant to my own ears. \"He's growing.\"\n\nRob laughed, a booming, meat-heavy sound. \"Yeah? They do that. Little tigers.\"\n\n\"No-\" I whispered. \"He's *uh.. He's- It's. Not right.*\"\n\nHe stopped laughing. He handed me the wrapped meat slowly. \"Go home, kid. Get some sleep.\"\n\nWhen I returned, the apartment felt different. Ralph was where I left him, but he had changed again.\n\nA lump had formed on his left shoulder. It was the size of a golf ball, pulsing rhythmically.\n\nI threw the meat onto the floor. I didn't even put it in a bowl.\n\nRalph descended on it. He didn't eat like a cat anymore. He unhinged his jaw again, this time I heard the distinct *pop* and *crack* of cartilage separating, and shoveled the meat in. He swallowed the steak whole, his throat distending like a snake's, a massive lump traveling down his gullet.\n\n\"Goooood...\" he gurgled while chewing the ground beef. The sound of wet mastication filled the silent room. \"Strrr... ength.\"\n\nI backed away, retreating to the kitchenette. \"What are you?\" I asked. \"You're not Ralph.\"\n\nRalph finished the meat in under a minute. He licked his chops, his tongue looking too long, too thick. It was purple now, not pink.\n\n\"Wes... sell.\" He said. \"Eye... am... a... wessell.\"\n\n\"Vessel?\"\n\n\"For... Him.\"\n\n\"Who is Him?\"\n\nRalph turned to look at the water stain on the ceiling. It had grown. It was jet black now, and it seemed to be dripping upwards, gravity reversing in that specific spot.\n\n\"The... Herald... comes-\" Ralph whispered.\n\n# Chapter 5: The Space\n\nA week passed. Or maybe a month. Time became fluid, viscous.\n\nI stopped showering. I stopped eating, mostly. I fed Ralph. That was my purpose. I went out only to buy meat. All my money went to meat.\n\nThe apartment was changing.\n\nIt started with the angles. I’d look at the corner of the room, and it wouldn't look like ninety degrees anymore. It looked... Sharper. Acute, piercing the eye. Or sometimes impossibly obtuse, stretching away into a distance that shouldn't exist in a 400-square-foot studio.\n\nThe sounds of the city, sirens, traffic, shouting, were gone. The windows showed a thick, swirling fog that pressed against the glass like a living thing.\n\nRalph was the size of a beagle now. His fur was falling out in wet, bloody clumps, revealing skin that was no longer skin. It was a translucent, gelatinous membrane, throbbing with a network of black veins that looked like ink swimming in water.\n\nThe lump on his shoulder had burst open, not with blood, but with a clear, viscous slime. From the wound, a cluster of three small, human-like eyes blinked in rapid succession. They had no eyelids, just a raw rim of flesh that squeezed shut every few seconds.\n\nHis whiskers were gone. In their place, long, translucent tendrils writhed, feeling the air like the antennae of a deep-sea crustacean. They dripped a constant, clear fluid that sizzled faintly when it hit the floorboards.\n\nHe spoke fluently now, though the voice was a multi-tonal horror, sounding like a man and a beast speaking in unison.\n\n\"The barrier is thinning, Arthur.\" Ralph said. He was perched on top of the refrigerator. His claws had elongated into black, metallic hooks that dug into the enamel, leaving deep gouges. \"Can you hear them?\"\n\nI was sitting on the floor, hugging my knees, rocking back and forth. \"I don't hear anything. I just want it to stop.\"\n\n\"You will.\" the cat-thing promised. \"They sing in the space between seconds.\"\n\n\"Why me?\" I wept. \"Why here? I'm nobody.\"\n\nRalph let out a sound that might have been a laugh. It sounded like tearing canvas. \"Because you are hollow, Arthur. You are empty. You have no passion. You have no hate. You are a perfect vacuum. Nature abhors a vacuum... But *They* love it. You are the perfect doorway because you never bothered to lock yourself.\"\n\nHe jumped down. He landed with a wet, heavy slap that shook the floorboards. He limped toward me. He had too many legs now. A cluster of small, atrophied limbs was sprouting from his ribcage, twitching uselessly. They were skeletal, wrapped in a thin film of mucus, grasping at the air with tiny, translucent fingers that looked uncomfortably human.\n\n\"Look at me.\" He commanded.\n\nI looked. I couldn't look away.\n\n\"I am becoming beautiful.\" Ralph said. His face was elongating, the snout stretching into a proboscis. His teeth were needle-thin and serrated, arranged in concentric rings that rotated slowly in opposite directions. \"The flesh is just a cage. I am breaking the bars.\"\n\n\"You're hurting...\" I whispered. \"You look like you're in agony.\"\n\n\"No-\" Ralph said. \"Pain is the signal connecting the nerve to the infinite. I am receiving the broadcast.\"\n\n# Chapter 6: The Abundance\n\nThe TV turned itself on that night.\n\nI hadn't paid the electric bill. The power should have been out. But the TV flickered to life.\n\nIt wasn't static. Static implies randomness. This was not random.\n\nThe screen displayed a churning, monochromatic swarm. Dead pixels bleeding into one another, forming shapes that almost resolved into faces before melting away. It looked like a colony of ants eating a corpse, viewed from space.\n\n\"Watch.\" Ralph whispered from the darkness. He was everywhere now. I could hear him skittering on the walls, on the ceiling. Gravity seemed to have less of a hold on him.\n\nI watched the screen.\n\nAnd then I saw them. Shapes in the noise. Impossible geometries. Cities made of obsidian towers that twisted in spirals, piercing a sky that looked like bruised flesh. Creatures that were vast, cloud-sized jellyfish drifting through voids of burning violet, trailing tentacles that swept across the surface of dying worlds.\n\n\"That is home.\" Ralph’s voice came from directly behind my ear. I felt his breath, radiating a heat that tasted of sulfur and rot.\n\n\"It's not real-\" I sobbed.\n\n\"It is the *only* thing that is real.\" Ralph hissed. \"Your world? This box? This job? This pathetic little life? It is a dream. A shadow cast by a dying sun. This is the truth.\"\n\nHe draped a limb over my shoulder. It was heavy, slick with slime.\n\nI flinched, but I couldn't move. The limb didn't feel like a paw. It felt like a bag of wet gravel. I looked down at it. The fur was gone. The skin was peeling back, revealing raw, red musculature that twitched rhythmically. Embedded in the muscle were tiny, pearl-like spheres.\n\nEyes. Hundreds of them.\n\nThey were all looking at me. They were blinking out of sync, rolling in the raw meat of his arm. Some were cat eyes, yellow and slit-pupiled. Some were human, blue and brown. Some were just black pits.\n\n\"We are opening the door, Arthur. You and I. I am the key. You are the doorframe.\"\n\nI tried to run then. The panic finally overrode the apathy.\n\nI scrambled up and ran for the door. I grabbed the handle.\n\nIt didn't turn. It was soft. Warm.\n\nI looked down. The doorknob was gone. The door itself was gone. Where the wood should have been, there was flesh. Gray, pulsing wall-flesh. The wallpaper pattern continued over it, but it was just a texture on the skin. I could feel a heartbeat underneath the surface.\n\nI pounded on it. It felt like hitting a side of raw beef.\n\n\"Help!\" I screamed. \"Let me out! Fire! Help!\"\n\n\"There is no out.\" The thing that was once Ralph gurgled from the ceiling. \"There is only *through*.\"\n\n# Chapter 7: The Chrysalis\n\nThe breakdown accelerated.\n\nBy the second week of the siege, Ralph was no longer a cat. He was a mound of biological disorder. He occupied the center of the room, a pulsing mass of gray flesh, eyes, mouths, and fur. He was roughly the size of a sofa now.\n\nHe didn't move anymore. He didn't need to. He was rooted to the floor by thick, fleshy tendrils that had burrowed into the wood, cracking the floorboards, seeking the earth beneath the building. These roots were translucent, and I could see fluids pumping through them, black bile, yellow pus, and something that glowed with a sick, violet light.\n\nThe surface of his body was in constant motion. Patches of fur would sprout and instantly wither, falling away to reveal wet, glistening organs that had no name. Mouths opened and closed on his back, on his flanks, gnashing teeth that looked like broken glass.\n\nBut it was the eyes that broke me.\n\nThere were trillions of them.\n\nThey covered every inch of the mound that wasn't a mouth or a sore. They were microscopic, forming shimmering waves like the scales of a fish, and they were massive, bulging orbs the size of dinner plates that wept thick, black ichor. They were on stalks that swayed in the dead air. They were embedded deep in folds of fatty tissue.\n\nAnd every single one of them was watching me.\n\nHe spoke constantly. A stream of consciousness that poured out of three different mouths simultaneously, weaving a cacophony of madness.\n\n\"The angles are sharpening... The sky is bruising... The stars are itching... Can you feel the itch, Arthur? It itches behind the eyes... The Great Dreamer is waking... The sleeper turns... and the world shakes...\"\n\nI was starving. I was dehydrated. My skin was gray. My hair was falling out. I was becoming like him.\n\n\"Arthur-!\" The central mouth boomed. It was a vertical slit in the biomass, lined with rows of shark-like teeth and dripping a caustic saliva that smoked when it hit the floor. \"The time is now.\"\n\n\"What time?\" I whispered. I was lying on the floor, too weak to stand.\n\nOne of the larger eyes, a wet, red thing that swiveled on a stalk of gristle, turned toward me.\n\n\"The birth. Look at the window, Arthur.\"\n\nI turned my head slowly. The window was the only connection left. The glass was vibrating, singing a high-pitched note that made my teeth ache.\n\nI crawled toward it. My legs felt like rubber.\n\nI reached the glass and wiped away the condensation.\n\nI expected to see the brick wall. I expected to see rain.\n\nI saw the Beginning.\n\nThe sky was the color of a fresh bruise, purple, black, and sickly green. The clouds were churning, roiling like boiling milk. And hanging in the sky, dwarfing the skyscrapers that looked like children's toys, were *shapes*.\n\nThey were vast. Titanic. They floated with a horrific grace. They had too many limbs, too many eyes. They were weaving the clouds into patterns, glowing sigils that hurt to look at.\n\nAnd down below, in the streets...\n\nThe people weren't running. They were standing still. Staring up. And as I watched, I saw them changing. Melting. Elongating. Their bodies breaking down and reforming into shapes that pleased the things in the sky.\n\n\"The chrysalis is breaking-\" Ralph boomed. His voice shook the room. The plaster cracked. The floorboards buckled.\n\nI turned back to the creature in the center of the room.\n\nThe mound was splitting open. A wet, tearing sound filled the air, like a sheet being ripped in half.\n\nSomething was climbing out of the meat that used to be my cat.\n\nIt was light. Pure, blinding, agonizing light. But it wasn't white light. It was a color I couldn't name. \"Thank you, Arthur.\" The voice said. It no longer sounded like gravel. It sounded like a choir of drowning children, beautiful and dreadful, momentary, yet infinite, ringing with the everlasting grief and gratitude. \"You were a sufficient host. The shell is broken. The Hatching begins.\"\n\nThe light expanded. It consumed the kitchenette. It consumed the sagging armchair. It consumed the peeling wallpaper.\n\nI backed up against the window. The glass behind me began to crack, spiderwebbing under the pressure of the creature's birth.\n\n\"I'm pathetic.\" I whispered. It was my final thought. A realization of absolute truth. I was nothing.\n\n\"Yes.\" The presence agreed, not with malice, but with cold fact. \"But you were the door. And a door does not need to be anything else.\"\n\nThe glass shattered.\n\nThe air from outside rushed in.\n\nThe creature that had been Ralph ascended into the new sky, a beacon of impossible light joining the chorus above. I just sat there, in the ruin of my apartment, watching the sky descend. The clouds were not clouds anymore- They were membranes. Thin, pulsating, translucent membranes stretching across the horizon.\n\nAnd behind them, something vast was moving. Pushing.\n\nThe mountains in the distance weren't crumbling; they were shivering. The ocean wasn't rising; it was recoiling. The entire sky bulged downward, straining against the fabric of reality. I saw a shape pressing against the other side of the sky... A claw the size of a continent, a wet, dark eye wider than the moon.\n\nThe world was not ending. It was hatching. And we were the yolk.",

I just sort of tolerated it, the way you tolerate a low-level migraine behind the eyes or the damp sensation in your socks on a rainy Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My name is Arthur, but nobody really used it. To my boss at the telemarketing center, I was &amp;quot;Line 4&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Start dialing&amp;quot;. To my landlord, Mr. Henderson, I was the late check in 4B. To the rest of the world, I was invisible, a smear of beige in a world that was rapidly losing its saturation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I lived in a box. That’s what it was, effectively. A studio apartment in a building that felt permanently damp, heavy with the cloying atmosphere of boiled cabbage, bleach, and the metallic taste of old pipes. The wallpaper was peeling in long, sunburned strips that looked like dead skin, revealing the yellowed, crumbly plaster beneath. The radiator hissed and clanked like a dying engine, screaming in the middle of the night but never actually producing heat. It was just noise. Everything in my life was just noise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then there was Ralph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph was a cat. A black cat, specifically, though &amp;quot;black&amp;quot; implies a richness of color, a sleekness that Ralph entirely lacked. He was a dusty, soot-colored rascal with patches of missing fur and a tail that had a permanent kink near the tip, as if someone had slammed it in a door years ago. I didn&amp;#39;t abuse him, to be clear. I found him in the alley behind the Chinese takeout place, eating something that looked worryingly like a rat&amp;#39;s tail. We were kindred spirits, I supposed. Two broken things eating garbage in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I took him in because it was pathetic to be alone, and slightly less pathetic to be a guy with a cat. Or so I told myself. It was an anchor, however small, to the concept of &amp;quot;home&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The routine was ironclad. I’d wake up at 6:00 AM to the sound of my neighbor in 5B coughing, a wet, hacking sound that seeped through the thin ceiling like a murmur. I’d shower in lukewarm water that left a film on my skin. I’d take the bus, staring at the back of someone’s dandruff-speckled coat for forty-five minutes. I’d sit in a cubicle, headset on, and repeat the script.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good morning, I&amp;#39;m calling on behalf of SunValley Timeshares, how are you today?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Go to hell.&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Click.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good morning, I&amp;#39;m calling on behalf of...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m eating dinner!&amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;Click.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Good morning...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eight hours of rejection. Eight hours of human voices telling me I was unwanted, an intrusion, a waste of signal. Then the bus. Then the apartment. Then Ralph.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph was usually the only good part. He wasn&amp;#39;t affectionate, not really. He didn&amp;#39;t purr often. But he was a presence. A warm weight. He’d be sitting on the windowsill when I unlocked the door, staring at the brick wall of the adjacent building, his yellow eyes tracking invisible bugs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m home, Ralph.&amp;quot; I’d say, tossing my keys into the ceramic bowl. The clatter was the loudest sound of my evening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph would usually trot over, weave between my legs, and headbutt my shin. It was a transaction, acknowledgement for food. I’d open a can of generic wet food, &amp;quot;Ocean Whitefish Dinner&amp;quot; which was gray sludge that reeked of preservatives, and he’d eat it with a wet, smacking sound that made my own stomach turn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then I’d eat my instant noodles, watch the local news to see who died, and go to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a routine. It was safe. It was numbness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Until the Tuesday in November when the rain started and didn&amp;#39;t stop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 2: The Mimic&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It had been raining for a week straight, a cold, gray drizzle that turned the city into a watercolor painting left out in the storm. The dampness had seeped into the building’s bones. The wallpaper peeled faster. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came home soaked, my shoes squelching with every step on the linoleum.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m home, Ralph...&amp;quot; I muttered, locking the deadbolt. It stuck, requiring a hard shove to slide into place.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No trot. No headbutt. No familiar jingle of his collar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ralph?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked into the main room. The light from the hallway didn&amp;#39;t seem to reach the corners of the apartment anymore. The shadows felt heavy, substantial, as if they had mass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph was sitting on the back of my sagging armchair. He wasn&amp;#39;t looking at the window. He was looking at the corner of the ceiling, directly above the radiator. A water stain had been spreading there for months, a Rorschach test of brown rot that looked vaguely like... Hm. Young Elvis, maybe?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ralph? Dinner time, buddy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t twitch. His ears were swiveled back, flat against his skull, streamlining his head into a reptilian shape. His tail was rigid, sticking straight out behind him like a rod.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked over and waved a hand in front of his face. &amp;quot;Hey. Earth to Ralph.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His eyes, usually a clear, piercing yellow, looked cloudy. Rheumy. Like milk had been dropped into weak tea. They didn&amp;#39;t track my hand. They were fixed on that stain, vibrating slightly in their sockets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fine.&amp;quot; I sighed, the exhaustion pressing on my shoulders like a yoke. &amp;quot;Starve then.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to the kitchenette. I grabbed the can opener. &lt;em&gt;Crnk-crnk-crnk.&lt;/em&gt; The release of pressure from the can filled the small room, usually a summons that would bring Ralph running from a dead sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dumped the sludge into his bowl. &lt;em&gt;Splorch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned back to the sink to fill the kettle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hsssss... clank.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The radiator. Standard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hsssss... clank.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I froze. The radiator hadn&amp;#39;t turned on. The knob was off. I turned slowly, the hair on my arms standing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sound had come from the chair.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ralph?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cat was looking at me now. His mouth was open slightly, his pink tongue lolling out, trembling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hsssss... clank.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sound came from his throat. It wasn&amp;#39;t an imitation; it was a &lt;strong&gt;playback&lt;/strong&gt;. It was the exact mechanical timbre of the radiator, perfect in pitch and metallic resonance, emerging from a biological throat. It sounded like metal scraping on metal, but wet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I dropped the kettle. It banged loudly in the sink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What the hell?&amp;quot; I whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph closed his mouth. He swallowed hard, a visible lump traveling down his throat. He blinked, slowly, his nictitating membranes sliding across his eyes like shutters. Then, he hopped down from the chair, walked to his bowl, and began to eat. The normalcy of it was more terrifying than the noise.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I rubbed my eyes until I saw stars. &amp;quot;Losing it, Arthur...&amp;quot; I muttered. &amp;quot;Stress. Sleep deprivation. You&amp;#39;re hearing things.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But later that night, as I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, I heard it again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drip. Drip. Drip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My bathroom faucet leaked. I knew the rhythm. One drop every four seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the bathroom door was closed. The sound was coming from the foot of the bed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#39;t turn on the light. I couldn&amp;#39;t. I just pulled the duvet up to my chin and listened to my cat perfectly replicate the sound of water hitting porcelain until dawn.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 3: The Vivisection&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Three days later, the atmosphere in the apartment shifted. A numb, buzzing vibration hummed in the walls. When I touched the doorknob, my fingers went dead for a second. When I touched the fridge, I felt a thrumming beat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph had stopped doing cat things entirely. He didn&amp;#39;t groom himself. His fur, usually dry and dusty, began to look oily. Clumped. He spent hours sitting in the center of the room, staring at me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And he was making sounds. Horrible, wet sounds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not the mimicry anymore. He was practicing. He was trying to mold his throat into a shape it was never meant to hold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 3:00 AM to a sound that scraped against my nerve endings. It was pitch black, save for the orange glow of the streetlamp filtering through the grime of the window.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hhhhuuuhhk. K-k-k-khhh.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It sounded like he was choking on a bone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat up, heart hammering. &amp;quot;Ralph? You okay?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glurk. Gaaaah.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sound was wet, tearing. Like meat being pulled apart.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I fumbled for the lamp switch. The bulb flickered to life, casting long, jumping shadows that seemed to detach from the objects casting them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph was sitting at the end of the bed. But he wasn&amp;#39;t sitting like a cat. He was... Squatting. His hind legs were splayed out unnaturally to the sides, his front paws resting on his knees. It looked like a mockery of a human sitting position. His spine was too straight, rigid as an iron bar.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He was staring at me. Saliva was dripping from his chin, thick and yellow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ralph?&amp;quot; I asked, my voice trembling.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph’s jaw unhinged.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t just open wide. I heard the &lt;em&gt;pop&lt;/em&gt; of the temporomandibular joint dislocating. The lower jaw hung loose, swinging slightly. His tongue, now a swollen, purple slug, lolled out.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Then, the muscles in his neck began to spasm. They bunched and rolled under the black fur like snakes trapped in a sack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aaaah...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a gasp. A breath of air forced over vocal cords that were thickening, hardening.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Rrr... rrrhh...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He gagged. His whole body convulsed. He threw his head back, his neck stretching unnaturally long.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aaaarrr... thhhh...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Blood sprayed from his mouth. Just a mist, speckling the white duvet. He was tearing his own throat apart to make the sound.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Aaaarrr... thhhh... uuuuur.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arthur.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He said my name.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t sound like a human voice. It sounded like two wet stones grinding together, wrapped in velvet. It was a sound that had no business... Being. It was heavy, dropping from his mouth like a physical object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I scrambled back, hitting the headboard. &amp;quot;No-&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;No, no, no- I&amp;#39;m asleep. This is a dream. A stress dream.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph closed his mouth. He used his paw to physically push his jaw back into place with a sickening &lt;em&gt;click&lt;/em&gt;. He tilted his head to the side, a jerky, bird-like motion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ar... thur...&amp;quot; He said again. Clearer this time. Less grinding, more... Squelching.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stop it!&amp;quot; I shouted, grabbing a pillow and throwing it at him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The pillow hit him. He didn&amp;#39;t flinch. He didn&amp;#39;t move. He just absorbed the blow and kept staring.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Lis... ten-&amp;quot; Ralph rasped.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hyperventilated. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going crazy. I&amp;#39;m having a breakdown.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No...&amp;quot; Ralph said. The word was a hiss of escaping steam. &amp;quot;Wak... ing... up.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 4: The Hunger&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I called in sick the next day. I told my boss I had food poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re not in tomorrow, don&amp;#39;t bother coming back.&amp;quot; He barked.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I won&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot; I said, and hung up. I realized with a jolt of horror that I meant it. I couldn&amp;#39;t leave the apartment. I had to watch him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I sat in the chair, clutching a kitchen knife. Ralph sat on the counter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He looked different in the daylight. He was bigger. Not fatter, but &lt;em&gt;longer&lt;/em&gt;. Like his spine had stretched an inch overnight. His paws looked too large for his body, the claws not fully retracting, clicking on the laminate counter like tap shoes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Around noon, he looked at me. His throat bulged, the new vocal organs pulsing visibly beneath the skin.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hun... greeee...&amp;quot; He rasped. It sounded like a heavy chain dragging over concrete.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I flinched. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s food in the bowl.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot; The voice was stronger now. Less experimental. &amp;quot;Sludge... is... dead.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s fish, Ralph. It&amp;#39;s what you eat.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He jumped down. He landed with a heavy thud, heavier than a ten-pound cat should make. He walked toward me. His gait was wrong. Rolling. Shoulders pumping like a big cat, or a primate.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mmmmeeeeeaaaat...&amp;quot; Ralph groaned. The word bubbled up with a spray of yellow saliva.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t have meat. I have... Ramen?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The cat’s eyes narrowed. The pupils didn&amp;#39;t contract into slits. They dilated, expanding until his eyes were entirely black pools reflecting my own terrified face.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ffffff... llllesh. Red. Warm.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You want me to go to the store?&amp;quot; I asked, hysterically. &amp;quot;You want me to go shopping for you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes-&amp;quot; Ralph said. &amp;quot;The... butch... er.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went. I put on my coat over my pajamas. I walked out the door, down the stairs. The hallway seemed longer than usual. The distance between 4B and 3B felt like miles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I walked to the butcher shop three blocks away. The world outside felt fake. The people looked like cardboard cutouts, two-dimensional and poorly rendered. The noise of the traffic wasn&amp;#39;t a roar, it was a loop, repeating the same honk, the same engine rev, over and over.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I bought three pounds of ground beef and a raw steak. The butcher, a heavy-set man named Rob, looked at me strangely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You okay, buddy?&amp;quot; He asked, wiping his hands on a bloodstained apron. &amp;quot;You look like you haven&amp;#39;t slept in a week.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I have a cat-&amp;quot; I said. My voice sounded distant to my own ears. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s growing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rob laughed, a booming, meat-heavy sound. &amp;quot;Yeah? They do that. Little tigers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No-&amp;quot; I whispered. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;uh.. He&amp;#39;s- It&amp;#39;s. Not right.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He stopped laughing. He handed me the wrapped meat slowly. &amp;quot;Go home, kid. Get some sleep.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I returned, the apartment felt different. Ralph was where I left him, but he had changed again.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A lump had formed on his left shoulder. It was the size of a golf ball, pulsing rhythmically.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I threw the meat onto the floor. I didn&amp;#39;t even put it in a bowl.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph descended on it. He didn&amp;#39;t eat like a cat anymore. He unhinged his jaw again, this time I heard the distinct &lt;em&gt;pop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;crack&lt;/em&gt; of cartilage separating, and shoveled the meat in. He swallowed the steak whole, his throat distending like a snake&amp;#39;s, a massive lump traveling down his gullet.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Goooood...&amp;quot; he gurgled while chewing the ground beef. The sound of wet mastication filled the silent room. &amp;quot;Strrr... ength.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I backed away, retreating to the kitchenette. &amp;quot;What are you?&amp;quot; I asked. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not Ralph.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph finished the meat in under a minute. He licked his chops, his tongue looking too long, too thick. It was purple now, not pink.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wes... sell.&amp;quot; He said. &amp;quot;Eye... am... a... wessell.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Vessel?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;For... Him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who is Him?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph turned to look at the water stain on the ceiling. It had grown. It was jet black now, and it seemed to be dripping upwards, gravity reversing in that specific spot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The... Herald... comes-&amp;quot; Ralph whispered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 5: The Space&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A week passed. Or maybe a month. Time became fluid, viscous.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped showering. I stopped eating, mostly. I fed Ralph. That was my purpose. I went out only to buy meat. All my money went to meat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The apartment was changing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It started with the angles. I’d look at the corner of the room, and it wouldn&amp;#39;t look like ninety degrees anymore. It looked... Sharper. Acute, piercing the eye. Or sometimes impossibly obtuse, stretching away into a distance that shouldn&amp;#39;t exist in a 400-square-foot studio.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sounds of the city, sirens, traffic, shouting, were gone. The windows showed a thick, swirling fog that pressed against the glass like a living thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph was the size of a beagle now. His fur was falling out in wet, bloody clumps, revealing skin that was no longer skin. It was a translucent, gelatinous membrane, throbbing with a network of black veins that looked like ink swimming in water.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The lump on his shoulder had burst open, not with blood, but with a clear, viscous slime. From the wound, a cluster of three small, human-like eyes blinked in rapid succession. They had no eyelids, just a raw rim of flesh that squeezed shut every few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;His whiskers were gone. In their place, long, translucent tendrils writhed, feeling the air like the antennae of a deep-sea crustacean. They dripped a constant, clear fluid that sizzled faintly when it hit the floorboards.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He spoke fluently now, though the voice was a multi-tonal horror, sounding like a man and a beast speaking in unison.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The barrier is thinning, Arthur.&amp;quot; Ralph said. He was perched on top of the refrigerator. His claws had elongated into black, metallic hooks that dug into the enamel, leaving deep gouges. &amp;quot;Can you hear them?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was sitting on the floor, hugging my knees, rocking back and forth. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t hear anything. I just want it to stop.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You will.&amp;quot; the cat-thing promised. &amp;quot;They sing in the space between seconds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why me?&amp;quot; I wept. &amp;quot;Why here? I&amp;#39;m nobody.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ralph let out a sound that might have been a laugh. It sounded like tearing canvas. &amp;quot;Because you are hollow, Arthur. You are empty. You have no passion. You have no hate. You are a perfect vacuum. Nature abhors a vacuum... But &lt;em&gt;They&lt;/em&gt; love it. You are the perfect doorway because you never bothered to lock yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He jumped down. He landed with a wet, heavy slap that shook the floorboards. He limped toward me. He had too many legs now. A cluster of small, atrophied limbs was sprouting from his ribcage, twitching uselessly. They were skeletal, wrapped in a thin film of mucus, grasping at the air with tiny, translucent fingers that looked uncomfortably human.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Look at me.&amp;quot; He commanded.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked. I couldn&amp;#39;t look away.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am becoming beautiful.&amp;quot; Ralph said. His face was elongating, the snout stretching into a proboscis. His teeth were needle-thin and serrated, arranged in concentric rings that rotated slowly in opposite directions. &amp;quot;The flesh is just a cage. I am breaking the bars.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re hurting...&amp;quot; I whispered. &amp;quot;You look like you&amp;#39;re in agony.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No-&amp;quot; Ralph said. &amp;quot;Pain is the signal connecting the nerve to the infinite. I am receiving the broadcast.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 6: The Abundance&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The TV turned itself on that night.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I hadn&amp;#39;t paid the electric bill. The power should have been out. But the TV flickered to life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn&amp;#39;t static. Static implies randomness. This was not random.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The screen displayed a churning, monochromatic swarm. Dead pixels bleeding into one another, forming shapes that almost resolved into faces before melting away. It looked like a colony of ants eating a corpse, viewed from space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Watch.&amp;quot; Ralph whispered from the darkness. He was everywhere now. I could hear him skittering on the walls, on the ceiling. Gravity seemed to have less of a hold on him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I watched the screen.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And then I saw them. Shapes in the noise. Impossible geometries. Cities made of obsidian towers that twisted in spirals, piercing a sky that looked like bruised flesh. Creatures that were vast, cloud-sized jellyfish drifting through voids of burning violet, trailing tentacles that swept across the surface of dying worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That is home.&amp;quot; Ralph’s voice came from directly behind my ear. I felt his breath, radiating a heat that tasted of sulfur and rot.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not real-&amp;quot; I sobbed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; thing that is real.&amp;quot; Ralph hissed. &amp;quot;Your world? This box? This job? This pathetic little life? It is a dream. A shadow cast by a dying sun. This is the truth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He draped a limb over my shoulder. It was heavy, slick with slime.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I flinched, but I couldn&amp;#39;t move. The limb didn&amp;#39;t feel like a paw. It felt like a bag of wet gravel. I looked down at it. The fur was gone. The skin was peeling back, revealing raw, red musculature that twitched rhythmically. Embedded in the muscle were tiny, pearl-like spheres.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Eyes. Hundreds of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were all looking at me. They were blinking out of sync, rolling in the raw meat of his arm. Some were cat eyes, yellow and slit-pupiled. Some were human, blue and brown. Some were just black pits.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We are opening the door, Arthur. You and I. I am the key. You are the doorframe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I tried to run then. The panic finally overrode the apathy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I scrambled up and ran for the door. I grabbed the handle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t turn. It was soft. Warm.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I looked down. The doorknob was gone. The door itself was gone. Where the wood should have been, there was flesh. Gray, pulsing wall-flesh. The wallpaper pattern continued over it, but it was just a texture on the skin. I could feel a heartbeat underneath the surface.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I pounded on it. It felt like hitting a side of raw beef.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Help!&amp;quot; I screamed. &amp;quot;Let me out! Fire! Help!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;There is no out.&amp;quot; The thing that was once Ralph gurgled from the ceiling. &amp;quot;There is only &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Chapter 7: The Chrysalis&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The breakdown accelerated.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the second week of the siege, Ralph was no longer a cat. He was a mound of biological disorder. He occupied the center of the room, a pulsing mass of gray flesh, eyes, mouths, and fur. He was roughly the size of a sofa now.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn&amp;#39;t move anymore. He didn&amp;#39;t need to. He was rooted to the floor by thick, fleshy tendrils that had burrowed into the wood, cracking the floorboards, seeking the earth beneath the building. These roots were translucent, and I could see fluids pumping through them, black bile, yellow pus, and something that glowed with a sick, violet light.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The surface of his body was in constant motion. Patches of fur would sprout and instantly wither, falling away to reveal wet, glistening organs that had no name. Mouths opened and closed on his back, on his flanks, gnashing teeth that looked like broken glass.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it was the eyes that broke me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There were trillions of them.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They covered every inch of the mound that wasn&amp;#39;t a mouth or a sore. They were microscopic, forming shimmering waves like the scales of a fish, and they were massive, bulging orbs the size of dinner plates that wept thick, black ichor. They were on stalks that swayed in the dead air. They were embedded deep in folds of fatty tissue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And every single one of them was watching me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He spoke constantly. A stream of consciousness that poured out of three different mouths simultaneously, weaving a cacophony of madness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The angles are sharpening... The sky is bruising... The stars are itching... Can you feel the itch, Arthur? It itches behind the eyes... The Great Dreamer is waking... The sleeper turns... and the world shakes...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I was starving. I was dehydrated. My skin was gray. My hair was falling out. I was becoming like him.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Arthur-!&amp;quot; The central mouth boomed. It was a vertical slit in the biomass, lined with rows of shark-like teeth and dripping a caustic saliva that smoked when it hit the floor. &amp;quot;The time is now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What time?&amp;quot; I whispered. I was lying on the floor, too weak to stand.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the larger eyes, a wet, red thing that swiveled on a stalk of gristle, turned toward me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The birth. Look at the window, Arthur.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned my head slowly. The window was the only connection left. The glass was vibrating, singing a high-pitched note that made my teeth ache.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I crawled toward it. My legs felt like rubber.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I reached the glass and wiped away the condensation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I expected to see the brick wall. I expected to see rain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I saw the Beginning.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The sky was the color of a fresh bruise, purple, black, and sickly green. The clouds were churning, roiling like boiling milk. And hanging in the sky, dwarfing the skyscrapers that looked like children&amp;#39;s toys, were &lt;em&gt;shapes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They were vast. Titanic. They floated with a horrific grace. They had too many limbs, too many eyes. They were weaving the clouds into patterns, glowing sigils that hurt to look at.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And down below, in the streets...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The people weren&amp;#39;t running. They were standing still. Staring up. And as I watched, I saw them changing. Melting. Elongating. Their bodies breaking down and reforming into shapes that pleased the things in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The chrysalis is breaking-&amp;quot; Ralph boomed. His voice shook the room. The plaster cracked. The floorboards buckled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I turned back to the creature in the center of the room.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mound was splitting open. A wet, tearing sound filled the air, like a sheet being ripped in half.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Something was climbing out of the meat that used to be my cat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was light. Pure, blinding, agonizing light. But it wasn&amp;#39;t white light. It was a color I couldn&amp;#39;t name. &amp;quot;Thank you, Arthur.&amp;quot; The voice said. It no longer sounded like gravel. It sounded like a choir of drowning children, beautiful and dreadful, momentary, yet infinite, ringing with the everlasting grief and gratitude. &amp;quot;You were a sufficient host. The shell is broken. The Hatching begins.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The light expanded. It consumed the kitchenette. It consumed the sagging armchair. It consumed the peeling wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I backed up against the window. The glass behind me began to crack, spiderwebbing under the pressure of the creature&amp;#39;s birth.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m pathetic.&amp;quot; I whispered. It was my final thought. A realization of absolute truth. I was nothing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot; The presence agreed, not with malice, but with cold fact. &amp;quot;But you were the door. And a door does not need to be anything else.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The glass shattered.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The air from outside rushed in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The creature that had been Ralph ascended into the new sky, a beacon of impossible light joining the chorus above. I just sat there, in the ruin of my apartment, watching the sky descend. The clouds were not clouds anymore- They were membranes. Thin, pulsating, translucent membranes stretching across the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And behind them, something vast was moving. Pushing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The mountains in the distance weren&amp;#39;t crumbling; they were shivering. The ocean wasn&amp;#39;t rising; it was recoiling. The entire sky bulged downward, straining against the fabric of reality. I saw a shape pressing against the other side of the sky... A claw the size of a continent, a wet, dark eye wider than the moon.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The world was not ending. It was hatching. And we were the yolk.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "For the purposes of this event, clay includes a vast range of materials – play-doh, air dry clay, polymer clay, modeling chocolate, ceramic clay, and pretty much anything clay-like you can make something with. It can be used for anything from sculpting miniatures to making mugs to jewelry, word art, and more. Clay produces impressive-looking and long-lasting projects, but it doesn’t need to be complicated or expensive. Read on for some quick and easy clay options that use materials you likely already have in your home.\n\n**Potential ways to connect to a fic:**\n\nAs clay is such a versatile medium, there are a number of ways you can connect it to a fic. You can make a shaped slab with your favorite quote pressed or carved in, sculpt miniatures of characters or significant objects from the fic, make a clay diorama of a scene that really stuck out to you. Reading a coffee shop AU? Recreate the cafe’s mugs! Found a good Greek mythology AU? Make a Grecian urn depicting your favorite scenes. You can even make clay beads with engraved designs, or shaped like significant symbols from the fic for jewelry. If you’re using modeling chocolate, you can do any of the above and add it to a cake or other edible base - see our [culinary arts spotlight](https://fanartfrenzy.tumblr.com/post/802926795677679617/art-type-spotlight-culinary-arts-cooking) for more edible ideas.\n\n**Examples:**\n\nFigurines, either on their own or as part of a diorama, are a great option, like this super cute [Spy X Family figure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7o5EM7co2E) made with air dry clay, or these [clay demodogs from Stranger Things](https://www.tumblr.com/butchbarbie-psd/804282793154707456/felt-like-this-might-be-a-good-time-to-show-yall). Epoxy clay is another option for smaller sculpts, especially if you’re looking for a harder set. This kind of clay is ideal for jewelry or other small objects, like this [Warhammer 40k helmet](https://www.reddit.com/r/clay/comments/1pgws36/warhammer_40k_helmet/).\n\nPolymer clay can be a great option for making little scenes and objects, like this [dragon scene](https://www.reddit.com/r/polymerclay/comments/1ofulfi/i_made_a_scene_with_a_little_guardian_dragon/) by Azuraroselion, or this recreation of the iconic [birthday cake](https://www.reddit.com/r/polymerclay/comments/o94e1v/made_auroras_birthday_cake_from_the_disneys/) from Sleeping Beauty by tiffanyscreations. You can even use clay to make jewelry, like these adorable [Kermit the Frog earrings](https://www.reddit.com/r/polymerclay/comments/1mllzzk/my_hand_sculpted_kermit_the_frog_earrings/) made by bird\\_hands, or this [Supernatural](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supernatural/comments/1fm0zzo/my_sister_made_this_out_of_clay_for_my_birthday/) necklace. \n\nIf you’re using ceramic clay, you can make usable mugs and tea cups (or bowls, plates, saucers, etc.) like these [Lord of the Rings mugs](https://www.reddit.com/r/lotr/comments/1gbejl9/wanted_to_share_some_lotrinspired_mugs_i_made/), as well as vases, urns, jars, and more.\n\nYou can also use clay to make traditional sculptures and busts. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wO9DjJbJnw) by the Laughing Gargoyle shows the full process of sculpting a seriously impressive Solid Snake bust, including some paint troubleshooting which you may find helpful. \n\n**Resources, tutorials, and where to look for inspiration:**\n\nThe easiest and generally cheapest type of clay to work with is air dry clays, some of which can be made at home with basic household materials. Air dry clays do exactly what it says on the tin - dry in the open air, no baking necessary, just a little time. There are many different varieties of air dry clay, and some may work better for you than others depending on what you’re looking to make. This in-depth [guide to air dry clays](http://www.craftionary.net/air-dry-clay-guide/) will walk you through the different types available and what kinds of projects each is best suited to, along with tips, tricks, and instructions for getting started.\n\nIf you’re new to clay, baking soda clay is a good air dry option to start with. All you need is baking soda, cornstarch, and water. Check out [this tutorial](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Baking-Soda-Clay-Easy-Air-Dry-Recipe/) for a recipe and some project ideas. Baking soda clay can be used to make basically anything other kinds of clay can be used for, though it won’t be as strong or sturdy. \n\nBoth air dry and baked clays are great options for smaller objects and for recreating scenes in dioramas (see our [diorama spotlight](https://fanartfrenzy.tumblr.com/post/802035840835567616/art-type-spotlight-dioramas) for additional ideas and resources). Not sure which type of clay is right for your project? Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdUMksMCEx0) for a detailed comparison of air dry and polymer clays.\n\nPolymer clay and other home-bakeable clays are great for miniatures and other small projects. If you’re looking to make something small - jewelry, characters, objects from the fic, or recreating scenes in a diorama, polymer clay is a good choice. If you’ve never used polymer clay before, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnfh7cydAkA) (with an emphasis on miniatures) and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adSDvgTtY8Q) (with an emphasis on jewelry) are both good starting points. The Youtube channel [I the Crafter](https://www.youtube.com/@ithecrafter) also has many detailed tutorials and guides great for both beginners and experienced sculptors, including [this fantastic video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShLj6_5RXHg) that details common mistakes beginners make and how to avoid them, and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU-yXvDWpwY) comparing the various polymer clay brands. There are many tutorials available for making almost anything out of polymer clay, like this one for [making a clay garden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOYCyf4mf5Y), and this one for [miniature pies](https://www.instructables.com/Ingredients-5/), and this one for a super cute [macaron bracelet](https://www.instructables.com/Pastel-Rainbow-Macaron-Polymer-Clay-Bracelet/).\n\nFor edible projects, modeling chocolate is a great clay-like option you can use to make delicious and attractive-looking art. This can be made either with real chocolate or candy melts, depending on your budget. Check out King Arthur Baking’s guide and recipe [here](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/06/02/modeling-chocolate-for-cake-decorating), and this very thorough [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzhVM_dcyPw). Once you have your modelling chocolate, you can use many of the usual clay techniques detailed in the tutorials linked above for shaping, carving, and sculpting whatever you need to make.\n\nFor larger projects, or anything you’d like to make food safe, ceramic clay is your best option. This can also be the most complicated and expensive, unfortunately, but there are ways to make it easier and more affordable - see our notes on equipment and other resources below. If you’re not sure if this is the right choice for you or your projects, check out this [overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EP6JX6RhAg). For a more detailed look, or if you’ve never worked with this kind of clay before, watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkjNbTCFY1Q). From there, this [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbC14Txh1KZdaX5DkYYX8BBF3j9Bowhce) covers almost everything you need to know in terms of technique and how to use a pottery wheel.\n\nIf you already know a bit about clay or have worked with it before, I highly recommend checking out PotterytothePeople on youtube for excellent, detailed tutorials and tips for traditional clay work and pottery. [This tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2uyQAZjeE) for a footed mug is a great place to start. \n\nFor traditional clay work, you may need extra equipment like a pottery wheel and a kiln to fire your pottery or other clay projects. These are generally too expensive and inconvenient for most hobbyists to own, but there are many ways to access them for one-time use or for a few projects. [KilnShare](https://www.kilnshare.com/) has an extensive map of kiln owners willing to rent out or share their kilns with fellow potters - just zoom in on your location on the map to find a nearby kiln. If you’re in school or at university, your art teachers or art departments likely have studio space, pottery wheels, and a kiln which you can arrange to use. Your local library may also have a kiln available for patrons, like the [Warren County Library](https://warrenpl.org/pottery/). Community centers and art centers in your area likely also have pottery facilities and kilns that you may be able to use - they may also have courses available during which you can make your projects for this event with the help of an expert. If you’re completely new to clay and want to go the traditional route, I highly recommend this option. If you’re not sure where to look for courses, studio spaces, or a kiln in your area, try [Find a Pottery Class](https://findapotteryclass.com/find-studios/) \\- just enter your zipcode and use the filters to find a nearby pottery studio to suit your needs. These and a few other kiln-sourcing options and firing tips are covered in this excellent [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV4QLrpYgYk) by PotterytothePeople.\n\nFor help, support, and  troubleshooting, as well as ideas and inspiration, check out the many clay-related subreddits. For any kind of clay, [r/clay](https://www.reddit.com/r/clay) and [r/crafts](https://www.reddit.com/r/crafts/) are great resources. For miniatures and polymer clay, check out [r/miniaturesculpting](https://www.reddit.com/r/miniaturesculpting) and [r/polymerclay](https://www.reddit.com/r/polymerclay), and for pottery,  [r/pottery](https://www.reddit.com/r/pottery) is the place to go. \n\nAs with any craft project, [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/) is a great place to look for inspiration and detailed project tutorials - search for the specific thing you want to make or browse by category to get some ideas.\n\nFor more detailed instruction, never underestimate your local library. There are many excellent books written about clay and sculpture that can be acquired quickly and for free in physical or ebook form. Librarians are your friends and will not bite you - ask them for help in finding books and resources! Many libraries in larger cities offer additional resources such as clay firing, as mentioned above, or a ‘library of things’ where you can rent tools and crafting equipment, like the [Harris-Elmore Library](https://www.harriselmorelibrary.org/library-of-things-items/mini-pottery-wheel) in Ohio, or the [Bayside Library](https://bayside.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/OPAC/BIBENQ/302844408/30201279,3) in Australia.\n\nIf you find any tutorials or guides helpful when making art for the event, please show the creator some love and leave a comment!\n\n**What to avoid:** \n\nBe very careful on pinterest, tiktok, and youtube shorts - avoid ‘5 minute crafts’ style “whoa, it really works!” videos and other clickbait-y content designed to trick you. Many of these videos are deliberately short, sped-up, feature deceptive cuts, and recommend techniques that are both ineffective and potentially dangerous. These are often made by content farms, not individuals, and their goal is clicks and views, not to help people make anything real. When looking for instructional content, look for guides and videos made by dedicated individuals. A good tutorial will usually be longer, include lists of materials and resources, and show the full process with tips and tricks to ensure your success.\n\n**Additional notes:** \n\nBe sure to follow any safety guidelines listed on materials such as clay, glue, resin, and paints. Use recommended protective equipment such as masks, gloves, and safety glasses. Work in a well-ventilated area and don’t use hazardous materials in ways not recommended on the packaging. Be very careful with any blades and other sharp equipment, and anything involving heat or fire. When using a kiln or baking clay in an oven, be mindful of the heat and follow all safety instructions. In the case of polymer clay, don’t bake at higher temperatures than recommended on the packaging - use an oven thermometer to make sure your oven doesn’t run hot. If you’re on the younger side, get an adult to help!\n\n**Stuck or confused?** Drop a reply here, or check out our[ discord server](https://discord.gg/Q67uuhP4yE) and[ subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/fanartfrenzyevent/) for help from other participants!\n\nGood luck with your clay projects!

The Youtube channel &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ithecrafter\"&gt;I the Crafter&lt;/a&gt; also has many detailed tutorials and guides great for both beginners and experienced sculptors, including &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShLj6_5RXHg\"&gt;this fantastic video&lt;/a&gt; that details common mistakes beginners make and how to avoid them, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU-yXvDWpwY\"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; comparing the various polymer clay brands. There are many tutorials available for making almost anything out of polymer clay, like this one for &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOYCyf4mf5Y\"&gt;making a clay garden&lt;/a&gt;, and this one for &lt;a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/Ingredients-5/\"&gt;miniature pies&lt;/a&gt;, and this one for a super cute &lt;a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/Pastel-Rainbow-Macaron-Polymer-Clay-Bracelet/\"&gt;macaron bracelet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For edible projects, modeling chocolate is a great clay-like option you can use to make delicious and attractive-looking art. This can be made either with real chocolate or candy melts, depending on your budget. Check out King Arthur Baking’s guide and recipe &lt;a href=\"https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2022/06/02/modeling-chocolate-for-cake-decorating\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and this very thorough &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzhVM_dcyPw\"&gt;video guide&lt;/a&gt;. Once you have your modelling chocolate, you can use many of the usual clay techniques detailed in the tutorials linked above for shaping, carving, and sculpting whatever you need to make.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For larger projects, or anything you’d like to make food safe, ceramic clay is your best option. This can also be the most complicated and expensive, unfortunately, but there are ways to make it easier and more affordable - see our notes on equipment and other resources below. If you’re not sure if this is the right choice for you or your projects, check out this &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EP6JX6RhAg\"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;. For a more detailed look, or if you’ve never worked with this kind of clay before, watch &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkjNbTCFY1Q\"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;. From there, this &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbC14Txh1KZdaX5DkYYX8BBF3j9Bowhce\"&gt;video series&lt;/a&gt; covers almost everything you need to know in terms of technique and how to use a pottery wheel.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you already know a bit about clay or have worked with it before, I highly recommend checking out PotterytothePeople on youtube for excellent, detailed tutorials and tips for traditional clay work and pottery. &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pA2uyQAZjeE\"&gt;This tutorial&lt;/a&gt; for a footed mug is a great place to start. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For traditional clay work, you may need extra equipment like a pottery wheel and a kiln to fire your pottery or other clay projects. These are generally too expensive and inconvenient for most hobbyists to own, but there are many ways to access them for one-time use or for a few projects. &lt;a href=\"https://www.kilnshare.com/\"&gt;KilnShare&lt;/a&gt; has an extensive map of kiln owners willing to rent out or share their kilns with fellow potters - just zoom in on your location on the map to find a nearby kiln. If you’re in school or at university, your art teachers or art departments likely have studio space, pottery wheels, and a kiln which you can arrange to use. Your local library may also have a kiln available for patrons, like the &lt;a href=\"https://warrenpl.org/pottery/\"&gt;Warren County Library&lt;/a&gt;. Community centers and art centers in your area likely also have pottery facilities and kilns that you may be able to use - they may also have courses available during which you can make your projects for this event with the help of an expert. If you’re completely new to clay and want to go the traditional route, I highly recommend this option. If you’re not sure where to look for courses, studio spaces, or a kiln in your area, try &lt;a href=\"https://findapotteryclass.com/find-studios/\"&gt;Find a Pottery Class&lt;/a&gt; - just enter your zipcode and use the filters to find a nearby pottery studio to suit your needs. These and a few other kiln-sourcing options and firing tips are covered in this excellent &lt;a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV4QLrpYgYk\"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; by PotterytothePeople.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For help, support, and  troubleshooting, as well as ideas and inspiration, check out the many clay-related subreddits. For any kind of clay, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/clay\"&gt;r/clay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/crafts/\"&gt;r/crafts&lt;/a&gt; are great resources. For miniatures and polymer clay, check out &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/miniaturesculpting\"&gt;r/miniaturesculpting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/polymerclay\"&gt;r/polymerclay&lt;/a&gt;, and for pottery,  &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/pottery\"&gt;r/pottery&lt;/a&gt; is the place to go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As with any craft project, &lt;a href=\"https://www.instructables.com/\"&gt;instructables&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to look for inspiration and detailed project tutorials - search for the specific thing you want to make or browse by category to get some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For more detailed instruction, never underestimate your local library. There are many excellent books written about clay and sculpture that can be acquired quickly and for free in physical or ebook form. Librarians are your friends and will not bite you - ask them for help in finding books and resources! Many libraries in larger cities offer additional resources such as clay firing, as mentioned above, or a ‘library of things’ where you can rent tools and crafting equipment, like the &lt;a href=\"https://www.harriselmorelibrary.org/library-of-things-items/mini-pottery-wheel\"&gt;Harris-Elmore Library&lt;/a&gt; in Ohio, or the &lt;a href=\"https://bayside.spydus.com/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/OPAC/BIBENQ/302844408/30201279,3\"&gt;Bayside Library&lt;/a&gt; in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you find any tutorials or guides helpful when making art for the event, please show the creator some love and leave a comment!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to avoid:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be very careful on pinterest, tiktok, and youtube shorts - avoid ‘5 minute crafts’ style “whoa, it really works!” videos and other clickbait-y content designed to trick you. Many of these videos are deliberately short, sped-up, feature deceptive cuts, and recommend techniques that are both ineffective and potentially dangerous. These are often made by content farms, not individuals, and their goal is clicks and views, not to help people make anything real. When looking for instructional content, look for guides and videos made by dedicated individuals. A good tutorial will usually be longer, include lists of materials and resources, and show the full process with tips and tricks to ensure your success.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional notes:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Be sure to follow any safety guidelines listed on materials such as clay, glue, resin, and paints. Use recommended protective equipment such as masks, gloves, and safety glasses. Work in a well-ventilated area and don’t use hazardous materials in ways not recommended on the packaging. Be very careful with any blades and other sharp equipment, and anything involving heat or fire. When using a kiln or baking clay in an oven, be mindful of the heat and follow all safety instructions. In the case of polymer clay, don’t bake at higher temperatures than recommended on the packaging - use an oven thermometer to make sure your oven doesn’t run hot. If you’re on the younger side, get an adult to help!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stuck or confused?&lt;/strong&gt; Drop a reply here, or check out our&lt;a href=\"https://discord.gg/Q67uuhP4yE\"&gt; discord server&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fanartfrenzyevent/\"&gt; subreddit&lt;/a&gt; for help from other participants!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Good luck with your clay projects!

          "selftext": "Ceramic casting molds play a critical role in shaping functional and decorative ceramic pieces with accuracy and consistency. Whether you are a beginner exploring slip casting or an experienced ceramic artist scaling production, understanding the different types of ceramic casting molds and their uses can significantly improve your results. Choosing the right mold affects everything from surface finish and wall thickness to drying time and mold longevity.\n\nThis guide explains ceramic casting molds in detail, covering the most common types, their specific uses, and when each mold is best suited for your ceramic projects.\n\n# What Are Ceramic Casting Molds?\n\nCeramic casting molds are forms used primarily in slip casting, a process where liquid clay slip is poured into a porous mold. The mold absorbs moisture from the slip, causing a clay layer to build up along the interior walls. Once the desired thickness is achieved, excess slip is poured out, leaving a hollow ceramic form.\n\nThese molds are typically made from plaster because of its absorbent nature, but other materials such as silicone or resin are also used for specific applications. Ceramic casting molds allow artists and manufacturers to create identical pieces repeatedly with consistent quality.\n\n# Why Choosing the Right Ceramic Casting Mold Matters\n\nSelecting the correct ceramic casting mold directly impacts casting success. A poorly chosen mold can cause defects such as uneven walls, cracking, sticking, or excessive drying time. On the other hand, the right mold improves efficiency, reduces waste, and enhances the final appearance of the ceramic piece.\n\nFactors like production volume, complexity of design, clay body, and intended use all influence which mold type works best. Understanding mold varieties helps ceramic artists avoid common mistakes and extend mold lifespan.\n\n# Plaster Casting Molds\n\nPlaster molds are the most widely used ceramic casting molds, especially for slip casting. They are made using specific grades of plaster designed for ceramic applications.\n\n# Types of Plaster Used for Ceramic Casting Molds\n\nPottery plaster is commonly used for beginner and small-scale projects. It is affordable and easy to work with, making it ideal for learning mold-making basics.\n\nHydrocal plaster offers higher strength and durability than pottery plaster. It is suitable for molds that require finer detail and longer lifespan.\n\nHydrostone plaster is denser and more durable, often used in production environments where molds are repeatedly used.\n\nUses of Plaster Casting Molds\n\nPlaster molds are ideal for slip casting functional items such as mugs, bowls, plates, vases, tiles, and sanitary ware. They are also widely used for decorative ceramics, sculptures, and art pieces that require consistent replication.\n\nWhen to Use Plaster Molds\n\nPlaster molds are best when:\n\n* Slip casting is the primary forming method\n* Absorption is required to build clay walls\n* High detail reproduction is needed\n* Multiple identical pieces are required\n* Cost-effectiveness is important\n\nHowever, plaster molds are fragile and sensitive to moisture, so they require proper handling and storage.\n\nOne-Piece Ceramic Casting Molds\n\nOne-piece molds are the simplest type of ceramic casting mold. They consist of a single cavity where slip is poured and drained.\n\nUses of One-Piece Molds\n\nThese molds are ideal for simple shapes such as cups, bowls, planters, and cylindrical objects. They are commonly used by beginners due to ease of use and faster production time.\n\nWhen to Use One-Piece Molds\n\nOne-piece molds work best when:\n\n* The form has no undercuts\n* Easy release is possible\n* Speed and simplicity are priorities\n* Beginner-level projects are involved\n\nBecause of their limitations, they are not suitable for complex designs.\n\nTwo-Piece Ceramic Casting Molds\n\nTwo-piece molds consist of two interlocking sections held together with rubber bands or clamps. They allow more complex shapes than one-piece molds.\n\nUses of Two-Piece Molds\n\nThese molds are commonly used for pitchers, teapots, figurines, and containers with slight undercuts. They allow better control over form details and thickness.\n\nWhen to Use Two-Piece Molds\n\nTwo-piece molds are ideal when:\n\n* The design includes mild undercuts\n* More detailed shapes are needed\n* Clean seam lines can be managed\n* Moderate complexity is required\n\nProper alignment is crucial to avoid casting defects.\n\nMulti-Part Ceramic Casting Molds\n\nMulti-part molds consist of three or more pieces and are used for highly complex ceramic forms.\n\nUses of Multi-Part Molds\n\nThey are commonly used for sculptural ceramics, figurines, ornate vessels, and industrial ceramic components. Multi-part molds allow intricate shapes with deep undercuts and detailed textures.\n\nWhen to Use Multi-Part Molds\n\nThese molds are best when:\n\n* The design is complex\n* Precision is critical\n* Undercuts cannot be avoided\n* Professional-level results are required\n\nThey require experience to assemble and clean properly but offer unmatched flexibility in design.\n\nSilicone Molds for Ceramic Casting\n\nSilicone molds are flexible molds made from rubber-like materials. While not absorbent, they are sometimes used in ceramic processes.\n\nUses of Silicone Molds\n\nSilicone molds are often used for press molding clay rather than slip casting. They are excellent for capturing fine textures and intricate surface details.\n\nWhen to Use Silicone Molds\n\nSilicone molds are suitable when:\n\n* Flexibility is needed for easy release\n* Texture and surface detail are the priority\n* Non-porous molds are acceptable\n* Small batch or experimental work is involved\n\nSince silicone does not absorb moisture, it is not ideal for traditional slip casting.\n\nResin and Plastic Molds\n\nResin and plastic molds are non-porous and commonly used in industrial or decorative applications.\n\nUses of Resin and Plastic Molds\n\nThese molds are often used for casting clay bodies that do not rely on absorption or for forming ceramic components with pressure casting techniques.\n\nWhen to Use Resin or Plastic Molds\n\nThey work best when:\n\n* Absorption is not required\n* Durability is more important than porosity\n* Automated or industrial casting methods are used\n\nThese molds are less common in studio pottery but useful in manufacturing environments.\n\nTextured and Specialty [Ceramic Casting Molds](https://www.truegether.com/category/arts-crafts)\n\nTextured molds are designed to add surface patterns such as wood grain, fabric, geometric designs, or organic textures to ceramic pieces.\n\nUses of Textured Molds\n\nThey are widely used for decorative tiles, wall art, tableware accents, and sculptural ceramics.\n\nWhen to Use Textured Molds\n\nTextured molds are ideal when:\n\n* Surface design is a focal point\n* Consistent pattern replication is required\n* Decorative appeal matters more than form complexity\n\nThey can be made from plaster or silicone depending on the application.\n\n# Choosing the Right Ceramic Casting Mold for Your Project\n\nTo select the best ceramic casting mold, consider the following factors:\n\nComplexity of Design  \nSimple shapes work best with one-piece molds, while complex forms require multi-part molds.\n\nProduction Volume  \nHigh-volume production benefits from durable plaster molds like Hydrostone.\n\nClay Body and Slip Type  \nDifferent slips interact differently with mold absorption rates.\n\nSkill Level  \nBeginners should start with simple plaster molds before progressing to complex designs.\n\nBudget and Availability  \nSome artists purchase ready-made molds from suppliers or platforms, including [sites like eBay](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html) or TrueGether, especially when experimenting with new forms.\n\n# Caring for Ceramic Casting Molds\n\nProper care extends the life of ceramic casting molds and ensures consistent results.\n\n* Allow molds to dry completely between casts\n* Avoid excessive water exposure\n* Clean mold seams regularly\n* Store molds in a dry, ventilated area\n* Handle plaster molds gently to prevent chipping\n\nWell-maintained molds produce better casts and reduce material waste.\n\n# Common Mistakes to Avoid with Ceramic Casting Molds\n\nUsing a mold before it is fully dry  \nThis reduces absorption and weakens the mold.\n\nPouring slip too quickly  \nIt can trap air bubbles and cause surface defects.\n\nIgnoring seam cleanup  \nPoor seam management affects the final appearance.\n\nUsing the wrong mold type  \nMismatched molds lead to casting failures and frustration.\n\n# Final Thoughts\n\nCeramic casting molds are foundational tools in ceramic art and production. Understanding the different types of molds, their specific uses, and when to use each allows ceramic artists to work more efficiently and creatively. Whether you are producing functional pottery, decorative ceramics, or sculptural pieces, the right mold choice makes a measurable difference in quality and consistency.\n\nBy mastering ceramic casting molds and selecting them thoughtfully, artists can elevate both their craftsmanship and production workflow while avoiding common casting issues.\n\n ",

They are commonly used by beginners due to ease of use and faster production time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When to Use One-Piece Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One-piece molds work best when:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The form has no undercuts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Easy release is possible&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Speed and simplicity are priorities&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Beginner-level projects are involved&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of their limitations, they are not suitable for complex designs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two-Piece Ceramic Casting Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two-piece molds consist of two interlocking sections held together with rubber bands or clamps. They allow more complex shapes than one-piece molds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uses of Two-Piece Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These molds are commonly used for pitchers, teapots, figurines, and containers with slight undercuts. They allow better control over form details and thickness.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When to Use Two-Piece Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two-piece molds are ideal when:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The design includes mild undercuts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;More detailed shapes are needed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Clean seam lines can be managed&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Moderate complexity is required&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proper alignment is crucial to avoid casting defects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Multi-Part Ceramic Casting Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Multi-part molds consist of three or more pieces and are used for highly complex ceramic forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uses of Multi-Part Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are commonly used for sculptural ceramics, figurines, ornate vessels, and industrial ceramic components. Multi-part molds allow intricate shapes with deep undercuts and detailed textures.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When to Use Multi-Part Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These molds are best when:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The design is complex&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Precision is critical&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Undercuts cannot be avoided&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Professional-level results are required&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They require experience to assemble and clean properly but offer unmatched flexibility in design.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silicone Molds for Ceramic Casting&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silicone molds are flexible molds made from rubber-like materials. While not absorbent, they are sometimes used in ceramic processes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uses of Silicone Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silicone molds are often used for press molding clay rather than slip casting. They are excellent for capturing fine textures and intricate surface details.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When to Use Silicone Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Silicone molds are suitable when:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flexibility is needed for easy release&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Texture and surface detail are the priority&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Non-porous molds are acceptable&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Small batch or experimental work is involved&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Since silicone does not absorb moisture, it is not ideal for traditional slip casting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Resin and Plastic Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Resin and plastic molds are non-porous and commonly used in industrial or decorative applications.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uses of Resin and Plastic Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These molds are often used for casting clay bodies that do not rely on absorption or for forming ceramic components with pressure casting techniques.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When to Use Resin or Plastic Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They work best when:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Absorption is not required&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Durability is more important than porosity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Automated or industrial casting methods are used&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;These molds are less common in studio pottery but useful in manufacturing environments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Textured and Specialty &lt;a href=\"https://www.truegether.com/category/arts-crafts\"&gt;Ceramic Casting Molds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Textured molds are designed to add surface patterns such as wood grain, fabric, geometric designs, or organic textures to ceramic pieces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Uses of Textured Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They are widely used for decorative tiles, wall art, tableware accents, and sculptural ceramics.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When to Use Textured Molds&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Textured molds are ideal when:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Surface design is a focal point&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Consistent pattern replication is required&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Decorative appeal matters more than form complexity&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They can be made from plaster or silicone depending on the application.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Choosing the Right Ceramic Casting Mold for Your Project&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To select the best ceramic casting mold, consider the following factors:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Complexity of Design&lt;br/&gt;\nSimple shapes work best with one-piece molds, while complex forms require multi-part molds.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Production Volume&lt;br/&gt;\nHigh-volume production benefits from durable plaster molds like Hydrostone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Clay Body and Slip Type&lt;br/&gt;\nDifferent slips interact differently with mold absorption rates.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Skill Level&lt;br/&gt;\nBeginners should start with simple plaster molds before progressing to complex designs.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Budget and Availability&lt;br/&gt;\nSome artists purchase ready-made molds from suppliers or platforms, including &lt;a href=\"https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html\"&gt;sites like eBay&lt;/a&gt; or TrueGether, especially when experimenting with new forms.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Caring for Ceramic Casting Molds&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Proper care extends the life of ceramic casting molds and ensures consistent results.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Allow molds to dry completely between casts&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Avoid excessive water exposure&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Clean mold seams regularly&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Store molds in a dry, ventilated area&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Handle plaster molds gently to prevent chipping&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Well-maintained molds produce better casts and reduce material waste.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Common Mistakes to Avoid with Ceramic Casting Molds&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using a mold before it is fully dry&lt;br/&gt;\nThis reduces absorption and weakens the mold.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Pouring slip too quickly&lt;br/&gt;\nIt can trap air bubbles and cause surface defects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ignoring seam cleanup&lt;br/&gt;\nPoor seam management affects the final appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Using the wrong mold type&lt;br/&gt;\nMismatched molds lead to casting failures and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ceramic casting molds are foundational tools in ceramic art and production.

          "selftext": "A car’s shine is more than just appearance—it reflects how well the vehicle is maintained and protected. Many car owners invest in [Car Detailing in Wakad](http://www.careprostudio.com/) to restore their vehicle’s gloss, remove imperfections, and bring back that showroom-like finish. However, detailing alone cannot permanently protect the shine. This is where ceramic coating plays a crucial role. Ceramic coating enhances, preserves, and amplifies the shine achieved after detailing, making the car look newer for a much longer time.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3n48i3272obg1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e6585e6114dc1efbf90caef767346f5899083994\n\n# Understanding the Purpose of Car Detailing\n\nCar detailing is a deep cleaning and restoration process that goes far beyond a regular car wash. It includes thorough exterior cleaning, paint decontamination, polishing, and interior detailing. During detailing, swirl marks, oxidation, light scratches, and surface contaminants are removed to reveal the true paint finish underneath.\n\nWhile detailing restores shine, the paint surface remains exposed after the process. Without protection, the gloss can quickly fade due to sunlight, dust, pollution, rain, and daily wear. This is why an added protective layer becomes essential.\n\n# What Is Ceramic Coating?\n\nCeramic coating is a liquid polymer applied to a vehicle’s exterior surfaces after detailing. Once applied, it chemically bonds with the factory paint, creating a durable, transparent protective layer. Unlike wax or sealants that sit on the surface temporarily, ceramic coating becomes a semi-permanent layer that enhances both shine and protection.\n\nThis coating fills microscopic pores in the paint, creating a smooth, reflective surface that intensifies gloss and depth of color.\n\n# How Ceramic Coating Enhances Shine\n\nOne of the most noticeable benefits of ceramic coating is the enhanced shine it provides. After detailing removes imperfections, ceramic coating locks in that finish and amplifies it. The coating’s reflective properties increase light reflection, giving the paint a deep, glass-like appearance.\n\nThe smoother surface created by ceramic coating allows light to bounce evenly across the paint, resulting in a richer and more uniform shine. This effect makes the car look freshly detailed even weeks or months later.\n\n# Depth and Color Enhancement\n\nCeramic coating does more than add surface gloss. It enhances the depth and richness of the car’s paint color. Dark-colored cars appear deeper and more mirror-like, while lighter colors look brighter and cleaner. This depth effect is especially noticeable under sunlight and showroom lighting.\n\nBecause ceramic coating is transparent, it does not alter the original color of the car. Instead, it enhances the existing paint tone, making it appear more vibrant and refined.\n\n# Protection From Environmental Damage\n\nShine is closely linked to protection. Environmental elements such as UV rays, acid rain, bird droppings, road salt, and pollution gradually dull a car’s paint. Ceramic coating acts as a protective shield, reducing the impact of these harmful elements.\n\nBy preventing oxidation and chemical damage, ceramic coating helps maintain the glossy finish achieved through detailing. This long-term protection ensures that the shine does not fade prematurely.\n\n# Hydrophobic Effect and Clean Appearance\n\nOne of the standout features of ceramic coating is its hydrophobic nature. Water beads up and rolls off the surface easily, carrying dirt and contaminants along with it. This water-repellent effect keeps the car cleaner for longer periods.\n\nA cleaner surface naturally looks shinier. Because dirt, mud, and grime do not stick easily, the paint maintains its polished appearance with minimal effort. Even after rain, ceramic-coated cars tend to look cleaner compared to uncoated vehicles.\n\n# Reduced Need for Frequent Polishing\n\nPolishing removes a thin layer of clear coat each time it is done. Frequent polishing to restore shine can eventually weaken the paint. Ceramic coating reduces the need for repeated polishing by preserving the original finish.\n\nWith proper care, the shine achieved through detailing and protected by [Ceramic Coating in Wakad](https://share.google/1kq3Pr8F6o5n3dQgH) can last for years. This makes ceramic coating a cost-effective solution for long-term shine maintenance.\n\n# Resistance to Minor Scratches and Swirl Marks\n\nWhile ceramic coating is not scratch-proof, it provides resistance against minor swirl marks and light scratches caused by improper washing or daily use. This resistance helps maintain a smooth surface, which directly contributes to consistent shine.\n\nBy reducing surface damage, ceramic coating ensures that the paint remains reflective and visually appealing over time.\n\n# Importance of Proper Application After Detailing\n\nCeramic coating works best when applied on a properly detailed surface. Any remaining imperfections, contaminants, or scratches will be sealed under the coating if detailing is not done correctly. This is why professional detailing before coating is essential.\n\nA well-prepared surface allows the ceramic coating to bond evenly, resulting in maximum gloss enhancement and durability.\n\n# Maintenance of Ceramic-Coated Cars\n\nMaintaining a ceramic-coated car is easier compared to unprotected paint. Regular gentle washing using proper techniques is usually sufficient to keep the shine intact. Harsh chemicals and abrasive washing methods should be avoided to preserve the coating’s integrity.\n\nRoutine maintenance helps the coating perform at its best, ensuring long-lasting shine and protection.\n\n# Ceramic Coating vs Traditional Wax\n\nTraditional wax provides temporary shine and protection, typically lasting a few weeks. Ceramic coating, on the other hand, offers long-term gloss enhancement and protection that can last years. Wax requires frequent reapplication, while ceramic coating provides consistent shine with minimal upkeep.\n\nThis makes ceramic coating a preferred choice for car owners who want a durable, high-gloss finish after detailing.\n\n# When Additional Protection Is Needed\n\nFor car owners who want maximum paint protection, ceramic coating can be combined with other solutions. While ceramic coating enhances shine and chemical resistance, physical protection from stone chips and scratches may require advanced options.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nCeramic coating plays a vital role in enhancing and preserving the shine achieved through professional detailing. By increasing gloss, improving color depth, protecting against environmental damage, and reducing maintenance, it ensures that your car looks new for longer. After quality detailing, ceramic coating locks in the finish and elevates the overall appearance of the vehicle. For those seeking even stronger surface protection along with shine, advanced solutions such as [PPF Coating in Wakad](https://www.justdial.com/Pune/Care-Pro-Auto-Detailing-Studio-Wakad/020PXX20-XX20-220316030647-R8J8_BZDET) can be considered to safeguard the car’s exterior from physical damage while maintaining a premium look.",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A car’s shine is more than just appearance—it reflects how well the vehicle is maintained and protected. Many car owners invest in &lt;a href=\"http://www.careprostudio.com/\"&gt;Car Detailing in Wakad&lt;/a&gt; to restore their vehicle’s gloss, remove imperfections, and bring back that showroom-like finish. However, detailing alone cannot permanently protect the shine. This is where ceramic coating plays a crucial role. Ceramic coating enhances, preserves, and amplifies the shine achieved after detailing, making the car look newer for a much longer time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/3n48i3272obg1.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e6585e6114dc1efbf90caef767346f5899083994\"&gt;https://preview.redd.it/3n48i3272obg1.jpg?width=1200&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=e6585e6114dc1efbf90caef767346f5899083994&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Understanding the Purpose of Car Detailing&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Car detailing is a deep cleaning and restoration process that goes far beyond a regular car wash. It includes thorough exterior cleaning, paint decontamination, polishing, and interior detailing. During detailing, swirl marks, oxidation, light scratches, and surface contaminants are removed to reveal the true paint finish underneath.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While detailing restores shine, the paint surface remains exposed after the process. Without protection, the gloss can quickly fade due to sunlight, dust, pollution, rain, and daily wear. This is why an added protective layer becomes essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;What Is Ceramic Coating?&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ceramic coating is a liquid polymer applied to a vehicle’s exterior surfaces after detailing. Once applied, it chemically bonds with the factory paint, creating a durable, transparent protective layer. Unlike wax or sealants that sit on the surface temporarily, ceramic coating becomes a semi-permanent layer that enhances both shine and protection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This coating fills microscopic pores in the paint, creating a smooth, reflective surface that intensifies gloss and depth of color.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;How Ceramic Coating Enhances Shine&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the most noticeable benefits of ceramic coating is the enhanced shine it provides. After detailing removes imperfections, ceramic coating locks in that finish and amplifies it. The coating’s reflective properties increase light reflection, giving the paint a deep, glass-like appearance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The smoother surface created by ceramic coating allows light to bounce evenly across the paint, resulting in a richer and more uniform shine. This effect makes the car look freshly detailed even weeks or months later.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Depth and Color Enhancement&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ceramic coating does more than add surface gloss. It enhances the depth and richness of the car’s paint color. Dark-colored cars appear deeper and more mirror-like, while lighter colors look brighter and cleaner. This depth effect is especially noticeable under sunlight and showroom lighting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because ceramic coating is transparent, it does not alter the original color of the car. Instead, it enhances the existing paint tone, making it appear more vibrant and refined.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Protection From Environmental Damage&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Shine is closely linked to protection. Environmental elements such as UV rays, acid rain, bird droppings, road salt, and pollution gradually dull a car’s paint. Ceramic coating acts as a protective shield, reducing the impact of these harmful elements.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By preventing oxidation and chemical damage, ceramic coating helps maintain the glossy finish achieved through detailing. This long-term protection ensures that the shine does not fade prematurely.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Hydrophobic Effect and Clean Appearance&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the standout features of ceramic coating is its hydrophobic nature. Water beads up and rolls off the surface easily, carrying dirt and contaminants along with it. This water-repellent effect keeps the car cleaner for longer periods.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A cleaner surface naturally looks shinier. Because dirt, mud, and grime do not stick easily, the paint maintains its polished appearance with minimal effort. Even after rain, ceramic-coated cars tend to look cleaner compared to uncoated vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Reduced Need for Frequent Polishing&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Polishing removes a thin layer of clear coat each time it is done. Frequent polishing to restore shine can eventually weaken the paint. Ceramic coating reduces the need for repeated polishing by preserving the original finish.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With proper care, the shine achieved through detailing and protected by &lt;a href=\"https://share.google/1kq3Pr8F6o5n3dQgH\"&gt;Ceramic Coating in Wakad&lt;/a&gt; can last for years. This makes ceramic coating a cost-effective solution for long-term shine maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Resistance to Minor Scratches and Swirl Marks&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;While ceramic coating is not scratch-proof, it provides resistance against minor swirl marks and light scratches caused by improper washing or daily use. This resistance helps maintain a smooth surface, which directly contributes to consistent shine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By reducing surface damage, ceramic coating ensures that the paint remains reflective and visually appealing over time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Importance of Proper Application After Detailing&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ceramic coating works best when applied on a properly detailed surface. Any remaining imperfections, contaminants, or scratches will be sealed under the coating if detailing is not done correctly. This is why professional detailing before coating is essential.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A well-prepared surface allows the ceramic coating to bond evenly, resulting in maximum gloss enhancement and durability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Maintenance of Ceramic-Coated Cars&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Maintaining a ceramic-coated car is easier compared to unprotected paint. Regular gentle washing using proper techniques is usually sufficient to keep the shine intact. Harsh chemicals and abrasive washing methods should be avoided to preserve the coating’s integrity.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Routine maintenance helps the coating perform at its best, ensuring long-lasting shine and protection.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Ceramic Coating vs Traditional Wax&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Traditional wax provides temporary shine and protection, typically lasting a few weeks. Ceramic coating, on the other hand, offers long-term gloss enhancement and protection that can last years. Wax requires frequent reapplication, while ceramic coating provides consistent shine with minimal upkeep.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This makes ceramic coating a preferred choice for car owners who want a durable, high-gloss finish after detailing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;When Additional Protection Is Needed&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For car owners who want maximum paint protection, ceramic coating can be combined with other solutions. While ceramic coating enhances shine and chemical resistance, physical protection from stone chips and scratches may require advanced options.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Ceramic coating plays a vital role in enhancing and preserving the shine achieved through professional detailing. By increasing gloss, improving color depth, protecting against environmental damage, and reducing maintenance, it ensures that your car looks new for longer. After quality detailing, ceramic coating locks in the finish and elevates the overall appearance of the vehicle. For those seeking even stronger surface protection along with shine, advanced solutions such as &lt;a href=\"https://www.justdial.com/Pune/Care-Pro-Auto-Detailing-Studio-Wakad/020PXX20-XX20-220316030647-R8J8_BZDET\"&gt;PPF Coating in Wakad&lt;/a&gt; can be considered to safeguard the car’s exterior from physical damage while maintaining a premium look.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Please help because we are at a loss as to how we could have done more to insulate this shed. It’s super discouraging.

The key is knowing which affordable car detailing products actually work and how to use them correctly.\n\nThis article explores budget-friendly **car detailing products** that deliver real performance, explains why they matter, and offers practical guidance for choosing the best products for long-term vehicle care.\n\n# Why Choosing the Right Car Detailing Products Is Important\n\nYour car is constantly exposed to dust, pollution, sunlight, rain, and road grime. Using random household cleaners or low-quality products can damage paint, plastic trims, leather, and interior surfaces. Proper **car detailing products** are specially formulated to clean safely, enhance appearance, and protect surfaces.\n\nAffordable does not mean low quality.

Car Wash Shampoo (pH Neutral)\n\nA good **car detailing shampoo** is the foundation of any detailing routine. Affordable pH-neutral shampoos effectively remove dirt, mud, and traffic film without stripping wax or damaging clear coats.

          "selftext": "# Montclair Acorn Economy 2025: Year in Review\n\n**Greetings, Montclair neighbors!** Welcome to the **Montclair Acorn Economy 2025 Report**, a whimsical yet comprehensive roundup of our town’s year in business, community, and “nutty” local metrics. We’ll scurry through the **Acorn Index** timeline, dive into Montclair’s ETF-style sectors (from Health to Tech to Lifestyle), and pause for **Golden Acorn Awards** 🏆 and **Rotten Acorn Alerts** 🚨 along the way. By the end, you’ll see how Montclair’s squirrels (that’s all of us!) gathered acorns of progress through 2025 – **fun, smart, and true to Montclair’s character.** Let’s crack this nutshell of a year!\n\n# Acorn Index 2025: Squirrel Stash Through the Seasons 🐿️📈\n\n**Montclair’s Acorn Index**, our symbolic composite of local economic vibes, started the year strong around **$1.12**, reflecting post-holiday optimism. Despite winter chills, **local spending and savings held steady**, and by spring the index sprouted upward. A dose of “**reverse eggflation**” – falling grocery prices while local incomes rose – gave our Acorn extra buying power[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1jzpfcu/acorn_economy_week_2/#:~:text=Acorn%20Economy%20,comes%20to%20a%20close). In real terms, one Montclair “Acorn” fetched more eggs and bagels than before, as inflation fears cooled.\n\n**Summer 2025** saw the index **climb to about $1.17**[reletter.com](https://reletter.com/publications/james-publication-30#:~:text=Montclair%E2%80%99s%20Acorn%20Index%20held%20around,and%20prudent%20fiscal%20steps), riding a wave of new business openings, festivals, and robust community activity. This \\~0.5% uptick from spring reflected **steady local growth**[reletter.com](https://reletter.com/publications/james-publication-30#:~:text=Montclair%E2%80%99s%20Acorn%20Index%20held%20around,and%20prudent%20fiscal%20steps). The grand reopening of Lackawanna Plaza and a flurry of restaurant debuts infused economic acorns into our community, offsetting headwinds like higher interest rates. Even as national trends wobbled, Montclair’s diverse economy kept **squirreling away gains**.\n\nAfter a brief autumn dip (blame school budget jitters and a nut-tightening by cautious consumers), the Acorn Index **finished the year near $1.20**. A late-year boost came from holiday shopping and dining – Montclair’s downtown was abuzz with residents supporting local shops and eateries. Overall, our **Acorn Index** ended about **7% higher** than a year ago, a sign that **Montclair’s local economy** remains resilient and **nutrient-rich**for businesses and families alike. In short, 2025 was a year of **modest, steady growth** in our oak tree’s shadow, with plenty of acorns stored for seasons ahead.\n\n# ACH – Health &amp; Wellness Acorns\n\nMontclair’s community health saw **caution and care** in 2025. In spring, residents were alerted after a *measles exposure* was reported at Newark Airport (EWR), reminding commuters to check their vaccinations[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-18-2025/#:~:text=,Spot%20Coming%20to%20Upper%20Montclair). Around the same time, agriculture officials detected **bird flu** at a live poultry market in Essex County[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-18-2025/#:~:text=,in%20Montclair%E2%80%99s%20Acorn%20General%20Store). Thankfully, no local outbreak followed these scares, but Montclair’s Health Department monitored the situation closely, ensuring our **nest remains safe**. By summer, health officials were also keeping an eye on hazy skies from Canadian wildfires, issuing advisories on air quality – a smoky reminder of climate’s impact on public health.\n\nBright spots shone as well. A new **art wellness center**, *Keep Creating Art*, relocated into a larger space at Lackawanna Plaza, expanding inclusive art therapy programs for all abilities[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-18-2025/#:~:text=Keep%20Creating%20Art%20Wellness%20Center%2C,the%20cost%20of%20moving%2C%20renovating). This creative oasis offers classes that nourish mental health and community connection – truly **wellness outside the box** (of crayons). Montclair also saw growth in boutique fitness and holistic health services. From **Pilates studios** like women-only Pilatte (complete with a coffee/juice bar) opening in Upper Montclair[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,10%2C%20Montclair) to nutrition-focused cafes popping up, residents embraced a *“healthy acorn, healthy life”* philosophy.\n\nIn town government, Montclair’s Department of Health and Human Services continued outreach on everything from flu clinics to senior services. They promoted free **COVID-19 booster** pop-ups and heart health screenings at the YMCA. And remembering that *mental* health is health, local groups hosted workshops on stress relief and mindfulness. Montclair ended 2025 with **no major public health crises** and a renewed commitment to community well-being – a healthy harvest indeed.\n\n# ACB – Local Business Acorns\n\n**Downtown Bloom:** Montclair’s business district **burst with fresh energy** this year. The historic **Lackawanna Station redevelopment** officially opened as a new shopping and dining hub, welcoming over 20 new businesses under its restored 1913 roof[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=,com). The grand opening in June featured live music, art, kids’ activities, and free samples – marking a major infusion of economic acorns into our community’s stash[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=,com). Residents and visitors have been exploring the **food hall and marketplace**, where independent vendors now buzz in a space that sat empty for years. Montclair’s landmark train station has been reborn as a one-stop destination for artisanal eats, local crafts, and even a weekly farmer’s market vibe. It’s a *track* record we’re proud of!\n\n**New Nuts in Town:** 2025 was a banner year for new businesses – over **30+ shops, cafes, and studios opened** in Montclair and nearby[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=2025%20was%20a%20massive%20year,and%20Essex%20County%20in%202025). On Bloomfield Avenue alone, the diversity is delicious. We got a taste of world-class fine dining when *Iron Chef* Masaharu **Morimoto** opened **“MM by Morimoto”** in July, an elegant Japanese restaurant with an omakase bar and sushi flown in from overseas[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,193%20Glenridge%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair). (It’s reservation-only and the talk of the town for date nights.) Right next door, Morimoto’s team also debuted **OEN**, a swanky cocktail lounge and 12-seat omakase speakeasy in October[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,Avenue) – proving Montclair can attract culinary heavyweights.\n\n*Montclair’s dining scene keeps growing – the interior of a new Bloomfield Avenue restaurant, Sam’s Table, which opened in fall 2025 with a vegetable-forward menu and chic decor. Local foodies are already flocking here for its seasonal small plates and modern vibe.* [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,Bloomfield%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair)[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-august-10-2025/#:~:text=the%20Montclair%20news%20to%20keep,week%20ending%20August%2010th%2C%202025)\n\nMeanwhile, homegrown entrepreneurs filled our town’s niches. **Mashed Burgers**, a New Jersey-based halal burger joint, flipped its first patties here in March – bringing smash burgers, shakes and fries to Bloomfield Ave for comfort-food lovers[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,Bloomfield%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair). **El Gordo Peruvian Eatery**, a family-run restaurant, introduced bold Peruvian flavors (ceviche! lomo saltado!) to Orange Road after opening its Montclair outpost in March[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,324B%20Orange%20Road%2C%20Montclair). Coffee connoisseurs rejoiced as **Qahwah House** (brewing aromatic Yemeni coffee with cardamom and honeyed pastries) opened in February[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=around%20town%2C%20adding%20to%20Montclair%E2%80%99s,plus%20shakes), and **787 Coffee** brought Puerto Rican brews to town[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,Bloomfield%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair). For those with a sweet tooth, Somedays Bakery began serving Parisian-style croissants on Bellevue Ave in June[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,Bellevue%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair). The Montclair Girl reports that from **bakeries and fine dining to fitness studios and boutiques, 2025’s newcomers truly ran the gamut**[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=2025%20was%20a%20massive%20year,and%20Essex%20County%20in%202025). It’s proof that Montclair’s acorn economy is **thriving one new business at a time**[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=themontclairgirl,new%20business%20at%20a%20time)!\n\n**High Hopes &amp; Green Shoots:** In a milestone for Montclair’s *budding* cannabis sector, **The Kush Connection**dispensary finally won Planning Board approval on June 30th[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=,%E2%80%9Cbudding%E2%80%9D%20business%20open%20its%20doors). After a year of squirreling through red tape, this recreational cannabis shop will set up at 665 Bloomfield Avenue (a former auto dealership) with plans to open in 2026[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=,Montclair%E2%80%99s%20enterprising%20squirrels). The approval – which came with lively debate about parking and signage – adds “green acorns” to our local economy. Enthusiastic support from residents (and a punny Planning Board hearing or two) indicates Montclair is ready to **embrace this new industry**[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=of%20chatter%20about%20parking%20and,acorns%E2%80%9D%20to%20the%20local%20economy). Elsewhere, the trend of mobile businesses rolled on: Woofie’s Pet Service launched a new mobile pet-grooming van at Montclair’s Pride Festival[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=The%20pet%20service%20company%20Woofie%E2%80%99s,new%20mobile%20van%2C%20which%20serves), bringing *on-demand* pampering to local pups. From tech-driven services to mom-and-pop shops, Montclair’s entrepreneurial spirit stayed **strong and diverse**.\n\nIt wasn’t all smooth sailing – a few beloved businesses did close or move. A century-old Catholic store shut its doors, and some pandemic-era pop-ups ended their runs. But overall, 2025’s business climate was **nutritious**. Montclair’s **office of Small Business Advocacy** helped new owners navigate permits, and the Shop Local campaigns during the holidays kept cash registers ringing. With a *dizzying array* of restaurants, cafés, retail boutiques (inclusive lingerie at **Greymade** opened in January[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=their%20travels%2C%20art%2C%20and%20their,backgrounds%20in%20television%20and%20movies)!), and wellness studios, Montclair’s local business sector felt like **a well-mixed trail mix** – a little of everything, and plenty to crunch on.\n\n# ACT – Local Tech Acorns\n\nMontclair might be known for arts and eats, but 2025 proved we’ve got **tech chops** in our tree, too. The town’s young innovators made us proud: **Montclair High School’s Robotics Team 555** had an award-winning season, clinching the Quality Award at the Mount Olive FRC competition and a Creativity Award at Warren Hills[montclairrobotics.org](https://www.montclairrobotics.org/#:~:text=FRC%20Team%20555%20%C2%B7%202025,Warren%20Hills%3B%20and%20Creativity). These budding engineers (90+ students strong) designed a robot named “Riptide” to compete in FIRST Robotics Challenge, showing that STEM is thriving in our schools. Their semi-finals run and trophy haul underscored Montclair’s reputation for **hands-on tech education**. Talk about *high-tech squirrels* – these students are the acorns that will grow into future engineers and coders.\n\nLocal entrepreneurs also blended tech with community needs. At Montclair’s Pride Festival in June, **Woofie’s Montclair** unveiled a high-tech mobile pet care van (essentially a pet spa on wheels) to serve busy owners[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=The%20pet%20service%20company%20Woofie%E2%80%99s,new%20mobile%20van%2C%20which%20serves). It was a hit, and signals how local services are embracing technology – from app-based booking to GPS-enabled mobile vans – to make life easier for residents and their furry friends. Montclair’s small businesses increasingly use e-commerce, delivery apps, and social media marketing as part of their toolkit, keeping our township **plugged into the digital economy**. Even the corner farmstand might take Apple Pay now – truly a *new breed* of convenience.\n\nMeanwhile, Montclair welcomed a **global creative tech community** into its midst. This summer, the worldwide speaker series **CreativeMornings** launched its **first New Jersey chapter right here in Montclair**, hosting free monthly talks for local techies, designers, and innovators[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-august-10-2025/#:~:text=the%20Montclair%20news%20to%20keep,week%20ending%20August%2010th%2C%202025). Held at (where else?) Lackawanna Plaza’s new co-working space, these gatherings connect Montclair’s creative professionals with big ideas and each other. It’s like TED Talks meets networking over coffee, and it cements Montclair’s status as a **regional innovation hub** – no need to trek to Brooklyn or Silicon Alley when we have it in our backyard.\n\nOn the municipal side, Montclair continued upgrading its tech infrastructure. The township’s revamped website (launched late 2024) made it easier to pay taxes, report issues, and stream Council meetings online – no more buffering, hooray! And plans are afoot to pilot **smart parking meters** that accept contactless payments downtown. Montclair’s public library added more Wi-Fi hotspots for loan and hosted coding workshops for teens. In short, our community kept one foot in tradition and one in the future. By the end of 2025, Montclair’s local tech scene proved that even a **small town can think big** – whether it’s students building robots, or entrepreneurs coding the next startup in a Church Street café. The acorns of innovation are planted, and we’re excited to see them sprout.\n\n# ACE – Education Acorns\n\n**Classrooms, Changes &amp; Celebrations:** Montclair’s education landscape saw big shifts in 2025. In June, the town bid a fond (and bittersweet) farewell to **Immaculate Conception High School**, which **closed its doors after 100 years** of educating Montclair’s youth[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Image%3A%20lackawanna#:~:text=After%20100%20Years%20in%20Operation%2C,High%20School%20Closes%20in%20Montclair). Generations of alumni and faculty reflected on the legacy of ICHS – a cherished Catholic institution that shaped countless lives. As the Archdiocese made the difficult decision citing enrollment and financial challenges, the community honored Immaculate’s century of service at a final mass and reunion. It’s truly the end of an era on Cottage Place, and Montclair loses a little piece of its history with that blue-and-white Mustang mascot. *Good night, Immaculate,* and thank you for a century of acorns planted in young hearts.\n\nIn the public schools, **financial drama** took center stage. The Montclair School District uncovered a **$19.6 million budget shortfall** spanning last year and this year – a “surprise” deficit that had parents and officials scrambling[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=,Reported)[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20may%20take%20a%20hybrid,the%20state%20to%20stay%20afloat). By October, Superintendent Dr. Ruth Turner and Interim Business Administrator Dana Sullivan held town hall meetings to explain the dire numbers. The debt forced some tough choices: Montclair sought an emergency infusion of $12+ million (one-time) and even floated a special referendum to raise taxes for another $7 million[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=Interim%20Business%20Administrator%20Dana%20Sullivan,would%20be%20a%20recurring%20expense). Voters braced for the possibility of a December tax increase vote – and state monitors looming if we took a loan[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=Two%20main%20paths%20forward%20were,presented). Emotions ran high as parents asked if sports or preschool might face cuts[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=The%20most%20moving%20moment%20came,be%20on%20the%20chopping%20block)[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=,licenses%20and%20returning%20to%20textbooks). In the end, the Board of Education pursued a hybrid solution of state help and taxpayer support to fill the gap. The crisis did claim one casualty: the **district’s Business Administrator resigned** effective July 1, after a series of unpaid bills and late notices came to light[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=Montclair%E2%80%99s%20School%20Business%20Administrator%20Resigns%2C,Effective%207%2F1). By year’s end, Montclair’s schools were under closer scrutiny and an independent forensic audit was underway to ensure this *nutty fiasco* never repeats. It was a teachable moment in fiscal accountability (and perhaps a cautionary tale about not hiding acorns for too long!).\n\nOn a brighter note, Montclair’s students and teachers achieved plenty to celebrate. Aside from robotics victories, our **high school’s drama club** clinched a state award for their fall musical, and several Montclair teens became National Merit Scholarship semifinalists. In academics, Montclair High continued its renowned Magnet program, and Montclair Kimberley Academy (MKA) launched a new interdisciplinary STEM curriculum this year. **Montclair State University** had a milestone as well: Congresswoman (and alumna) Mikie Sherrill gave the commencement address in May, inspiring graduates as she herself transitioned to a new role (more on that later!). MSU also mobilized its **PSEG Sustainability Institute Green Teams** – student interns who worked with the Montclair township on environmental projects like home energy audits[sustainablejersey.com](https://www.sustainablejersey.com/news/newsletters/2025/fall-2025/#:~:text=Interns%20from%20the%20PSEG%20Institute,at%20the%20Montclair%20Farmers%E2%80%99%20Market)[sustainablejersey.com](https://www.sustainablejersey.com/news/newsletters/2025/fall-2025/#:~:text=sustainability%20and%20energy). This “town-gown” collaboration enriched both the community and the students’ learning, showcasing the value of having a major university in our backyard.\n\nIn community education, local nonprofits expanded enrichment programs. *Latinos of Montclair* launched “Ritmo Jardín,” a summer cultural program teaching kids percussion, Spanish vocabulary and Latin dance at the YMCA[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=Latinos%20of%20Montclair%20Launches%20New,Summer%20Cultural%20Enrichment%20Program). The Montclair Public Library hosted packed houses for its “Little Read” event in the spring and added a new digital media lab for teens. And Montclair’s Adult School (now in its 90th year) continued offering everything from ceramics to coding to hundreds of lifelong learners. Despite challenges, the **spirit of learning remained strong**. As Superintendent Turner said, this deficit is not the end of our story[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=,for%20the%20current%20academic%20year) – Montclair is working “side by side to protect what matters most: the learning, growth, and well-being of our students”[montclairpod.com](https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:~:text=,for%20the%20current%20academic%20year). Class dismissed, 2025 – and here’s to a wiser 2026.\n\n# NUT – General Tech &amp; Innovation Acorns\n\nBeyond our local scene, Montclair’s economy in 2025 was influenced by broader tech and innovation trends – often in quirky ways. Take **“eggflation”**, for example (or rather the lack thereof): after nationwide egg prices **skyrocketed in 2023**, this year they finally normalized, leading to what we playfully dubbed **“reverse eggflation.”** As one Acorn report put it, local value increased even while national groceries cheapened[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1jzpfcu/acorn_economy_week_2/#:~:text=Acorn%20Economy%20,comes%20to%20a%20close), meaning Montclair families paid a lot less for their omelets and holiday baking. Cheaper eggs and milk might not sound like tech, but improved supply chains (thanks to data-driven logistics and maybe fewer avian flu scares) played a role. We tracked our own **“eggs-per-acorn”** metric for fun, noting how many dozen eggs one Acorn Index unit could buy – and let’s just say by year’s end, the *yolks were on inflation*. This quirky indicator underscored a serious positive: **household staples became more affordable**, giving residents a little more cushion to spend on other things.\n\nTech innovation also touched Montclair in the form of **transportation and energy advances**. New Jersey doubled down on electric vehicles and green tech in 2025. The NJDEP rolled out rules requiring increasing sales of **electric trucks after 2025**, pushing automakers toward zero-emission models[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/newjerseydep/posts/-dep-is-leading-the-charge-on-electric-vehicles-in-new-jersey-this-driveelectric/1249553980549143/#:~:text=DEP%20is%20leading%20the%20charge,DEP%20is%20leading%20by). Montclair’s own delivery fleets and public works vehicles are eyeing electrification; already our recycling trucks run on cleaner fuels, and EV charging stations popped up in more public lots for residents switching to Teslas and Bolts. Statewide, investment in offshore wind and solar energy ramped up (you might have noticed those turbine parts being trucked down Bloomfield Ave en route to the coast!). These big innovations will mean a greener grid feeding Montclair homes in coming years – and possibly lower energy bills, too.\n\nIn the **tech business scene**, the New York metropolitan area’s growth spilled into Montclair. We saw more remote tech workers moving here for the suburban charm and fiber-optic internet, turning cafes into weekday coworking spots. A few Montclair-based startups gained traction: one local app developer, for instance, won a regional pitch contest for an AI-driven personal shopping app. And Montclair hosted an **Innovation Night** at the Wellmont Arts Plaza in October, where inventors and entrepreneurs demoed creations like smart home devices and eco-friendly packaging designs. The event – part-science fair, part-networking – highlighted the **creative brainpower** in our community. Jazz House Kids even had a booth showing off a student-built electronic instrument.\n\nFinally, on the policy side, Montclair kept an eye on tariffs and trade winds. Global supply chain improvements meant holiday gifts were easier to find (no repeat of last year’s toy shortage), and local bike shops finally got those backordered parts. While international issues like computer chip tariffs didn’t hit Montclair directly, our residents benefited from the general easing of shortages. New car lots actually had cars again, and prices for used cars came down from Mars. In summary, 2025’s big tech and innovation currents – from **EV adoption** to **AI apps** – reached our oak-tree-lined streets in subtle but important ways. Montclair is nothing if not adaptable, and our squirrels are quick studies when it comes to new gadgets and ideas. If the Acorn Index is any indication, we’re **charging into the future** (sometimes literally, in our new EVs) with curiosity and savvy.\n\n# LUX – Lifestyle &amp; Leisure Acorns\n\nLife in Montclair was as vibrant as ever in 2025 – a year filled with **street fairs, stage lights, and community spirit.** Our cultural calendar overflowed with events that brought out **thousands of residents and visitors** (and not just for the free samples!).\n\nThe summer’s crown jewel was the **Montclair Jazz Festival**, which returned bigger and bolder than ever. After a season of smaller concerts and Soundcheck shows, the Festival culminated in the **Downtown Jamboree on September 13th** – an all-day, open-air jazz extravaganza that literally stopped traffic. Bloomfield Avenue around Lackawanna Plaza transformed into a concert arena, with *three stages* of live music, a dance floor in the street, and over **150 food and artisan vendors** fueling the fun[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:~:text=There%20will%20be%20over%20150%2B,Jazz%20Discovery%20Zone%2C%20and%20more). An estimated **26,000 attendees** filled downtown (yes, you read that right – it’s now the **largest free jazz fest in the NYC region**)[montclairjazzfestival.org](https://www.montclairjazzfestival.org/become-a-vendor#:~:text=). From noon to night, world-class artists like Lakecia Benjamin, Jazzmeia Horn, Christian McBride’s band, and the Gotham Kings blew the crowd away[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:~:text=merchandise)[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:~:text=Headliners%20for%20the%20event%20include,generational%20quintet). Families camped out with lawn chairs, kids got their faces painted in the Family Jazz Discovery Zone, and our own Montclair Brewery unveiled a special “Jazz Ale” for the occasion[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:~:text=There%20will%20be%20over%20150%2B,Jazz%20Discovery%20Zone%2C%20and%20more). As twilight fell, the Block Party kept grooves going with DJ Brother Mister (a.k.a. Christian McBride in a DJ booth) spinning tunes[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:~:text=Zone%2C%20and%20more). The 14th annual Montclair Jazz Festival truly hit a new high note – **a Golden Acorn moment** for sure (spoiler!).\n\n*Musicians heat up the stage at the 2025 Montclair Jazz Festival Downtown Jamboree. The free September event drew an estimated 26,000 people to downtown Montclair for 8+ hours of live jazz across multiple stages*[*montclairjazzfestival.org*](https://www.montclairjazzfestival.org/become-a-vendor#:~:text=)*. It’s now hailed as one of the region’s premier music festivals – and it’s all right here in Montclair!*\n\nNot to be outdone, June brought the **4th Annual Montclair Pride Festival**, organized by Out Montclair. On June 14th, downtown was awash in rainbow flags and joyous crowds as this *inclusive celebration* took over Bloomfield Avenue. After successful festivals in 2022, 2023, and 2024, the **2025 Pride Festival featured live entertainment on three stages and 200+ vendors** ranging from food trucks to local artists[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L399%20The%204th,drink%20vendors%2C%20food%20trucks%2C%20LGBTQ). It was officially recognized as one of the top suburban Pride events in the nation[montclairnjusa.org](https://www.montclairnjusa.org/Visitors/Things-to-Do/Special-Events/Montclair-Pride-Festival#:~:text=%23%20Montclair%20Pride%20Festival%20,June%2014th) – and you could tell, from the incredible lineup (Dominique Jackson of *Pose* was a host!) to the huge turnout of families, teens, and allies. There was dancing in the streets (quite literally during the evening street dance party), and a moving equality rally by local leaders. Montclair once again proved itself a beacon of love and diversity, with residents coming together to **amplify LGBTQ+ voices and stories**[montclairnjusa.org](https://www.montclairnjusa.org/Visitors/Things-to-Do/Special-Events/Montclair-Pride-Festival#:~:text=We%20invite%20all%20families%20to,celebrating%20diverse%20identities%20and%20backgrounds). And yes, **Woofie’s pet van**making its debut at Pride – only in Montclair do we combine pet pampering with Pride partying!\n\nOur town’s beloved traditions continued to thrive. On July 4th, Montclair hosted the region’s **largest Independence Day parade**, complete with marching bands, vintage cars, creative floats, and community groups winding down Bloomfield Avenue[thedailysquirrel.substack.com](https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:~:text=,Grand%20Marshal%20was%20the%20Montclair). The parade – an annual highlight since 1947 – drew big crowds (water squirt guns and all), followed by a family picnic and fireworks at Yogi Berra Stadium. In early June, the **Montclair African American Heritage Parade &amp; Festival** returned to a festive atmosphere, celebrating Black culture with step dancers, drumlines, and local legends as Grand Marshals. From the **Greek Festival** at St. Demetrios Church (opa!) to Montclair’s **Oktoberfest** block party at Walnut Street, there was never a dull weekend.\n\nArts and film were also in the limelight. **Montclair Film Festival 2025** took place in October, drawing filmmakers and cinema buffs for 10 days of screenings at the Clairidge and Wellmont. Buzz was particularly strong for a certain Netflix production that filmed a scene at Montclair High School over the summer[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:~:text=Image%3A%20lackawanna#:~:text=Montclair%20,2025%20Property%20Taxes%20Introduced%20in) – yes, *Adam Sandler* was in town, producing a coming-of-age movie. (Local rumor: Sandler popped into a Watchung Plaza deli during filming. Montclair: where Hollywood meets hoagies.) The **Montclair Art Museum** launched a critically acclaimed exhibit of Charles White’s drawings in the fall, and hosted free First Thursdays that brought art lovers together. Even our historic **Bellevue Theatre** in Upper Montclair got a new lease on life – Montclair Film and Clairidge Cinema struck an agreement to reopen the 1922 movie palace soon[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,Bellevue%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair), sparking excitement for its grand return (indie films and popcorn under that iconic marquee, here we come!).\n\nFrom dining to nightlife, lifestyle in Montclair kept pace with the fun. **Restaurant Week 2025** in September saw record participation – over 50 eateries offered specials, from fancy pre-fixe dinners to casual cafe deals, feeding both our bellies and our sense of community. New nightlife spots like **Boozie’s Wine Shoppe &amp; Bar** at Lackawanna Station became the go-to for a laid-back evening sip[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:~:text=,1%20Lackawanna%20Plaza%2C%20Montclair). And let’s not forget our parks and outdoors: this year a new pollinator garden opened at Edgemont Park thanks to local volunteers, and the *Montclair Running Company* hosted monthly fun runs drawing dozens of health-conscious neighbors. For a “quiet” suburb, Montclair sure knows how to live it up. **Lifestyle in 2025 was LUX indeed** – luxurious not just in a material way, but in the richness of experiences. Whether you were dancing at a festival, enjoying a gallery opening, or simply people-watching at Church Street Café, Montclair provided a **vibrant, inclusive, and never-boring home** for all of us.[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Jersey_gubernatorial_election#:~:text=The%202025%20New%20Jersey%20gubernatorial,limited)",

We’ll scurry through the &lt;strong&gt;Acorn Index&lt;/strong&gt; timeline, dive into Montclair’s ETF-style sectors (from Health to Tech to Lifestyle), and pause for &lt;strong&gt;Golden Acorn Awards&lt;/strong&gt; 🏆 and &lt;strong&gt;Rotten Acorn Alerts&lt;/strong&gt; 🚨 along the way. By the end, you’ll see how Montclair’s squirrels (that’s all of us!) gathered acorns of progress through 2025 – &lt;strong&gt;fun, smart, and true to Montclair’s character.&lt;/strong&gt; Let’s crack this nutshell of a year!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Acorn Index 2025: Squirrel Stash Through the Seasons 🐿️📈&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Montclair’s Acorn Index&lt;/strong&gt;, our symbolic composite of local economic vibes, started the year strong around &lt;strong&gt;$1.12&lt;/strong&gt;, reflecting post-holiday optimism. Despite winter chills, &lt;strong&gt;local spending and savings held steady&lt;/strong&gt;, and by spring the index sprouted upward. A dose of “&lt;strong&gt;reverse eggflation&lt;/strong&gt;” – falling grocery prices while local incomes rose – gave our Acorn extra buying power&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1jzpfcu/acorn_economy_week_2/#:%7E:text=Acorn%20Economy%20,comes%20to%20a%20close\"&gt;reddit.com&lt;/a&gt;. In real terms, one Montclair “Acorn” fetched more eggs and bagels than before, as inflation fears cooled.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summer 2025&lt;/strong&gt; saw the index &lt;strong&gt;climb to about $1.17&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reletter.com/publications/james-publication-30#:%7E:text=Montclair%E2%80%99s%20Acorn%20Index%20held%20around,and%20prudent%20fiscal%20steps\"&gt;reletter.com&lt;/a&gt;, riding a wave of new business openings, festivals, and robust community activity. This ~0.5% uptick from spring reflected &lt;strong&gt;steady local growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reletter.com/publications/james-publication-30#:%7E:text=Montclair%E2%80%99s%20Acorn%20Index%20held%20around,and%20prudent%20fiscal%20steps\"&gt;reletter.com&lt;/a&gt;. The grand reopening of Lackawanna Plaza and a flurry of restaurant debuts infused economic acorns into our community, offsetting headwinds like higher interest rates. Even as national trends wobbled, Montclair’s diverse economy kept &lt;strong&gt;squirreling away gains&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;After a brief autumn dip (blame school budget jitters and a nut-tightening by cautious consumers), the Acorn Index &lt;strong&gt;finished the year near $1.20&lt;/strong&gt;. A late-year boost came from holiday shopping and dining – Montclair’s downtown was abuzz with residents supporting local shops and eateries. Overall, our &lt;strong&gt;Acorn Index&lt;/strong&gt; ended about &lt;strong&gt;7% higher&lt;/strong&gt; than a year ago, a sign that &lt;strong&gt;Montclair’s local economy&lt;/strong&gt; remains resilient and &lt;strong&gt;nutrient-rich&lt;/strong&gt;for businesses and families alike. In short, 2025 was a year of &lt;strong&gt;modest, steady growth&lt;/strong&gt; in our oak tree’s shadow, with plenty of acorns stored for seasons ahead.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;ACH – Health &amp;amp; Wellness Acorns&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Montclair’s community health saw &lt;strong&gt;caution and care&lt;/strong&gt; in 2025. In spring, residents were alerted after a &lt;em&gt;measles exposure&lt;/em&gt; was reported at Newark Airport (EWR), reminding commuters to check their vaccinations&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-18-2025/#:%7E:text=,Spot%20Coming%20to%20Upper%20Montclair\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. Around the same time, agriculture officials detected &lt;strong&gt;bird flu&lt;/strong&gt; at a live poultry market in Essex County&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-18-2025/#:%7E:text=,in%20Montclair%E2%80%99s%20Acorn%20General%20Store\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully, no local outbreak followed these scares, but Montclair’s Health Department monitored the situation closely, ensuring our &lt;strong&gt;nest remains safe&lt;/strong&gt;. By summer, health officials were also keeping an eye on hazy skies from Canadian wildfires, issuing advisories on air quality – a smoky reminder of climate’s impact on public health.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bright spots shone as well. A new &lt;strong&gt;art wellness center&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Keep Creating Art&lt;/em&gt;, relocated into a larger space at Lackawanna Plaza, expanding inclusive art therapy programs for all abilities&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-may-18-2025/#:%7E:text=Keep%20Creating%20Art%20Wellness%20Center%2C,the%20cost%20of%20moving%2C%20renovating\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. This creative oasis offers classes that nourish mental health and community connection – truly &lt;strong&gt;wellness outside the box&lt;/strong&gt; (of crayons). Montclair also saw growth in boutique fitness and holistic health services. From &lt;strong&gt;Pilates studios&lt;/strong&gt; like women-only Pilatte (complete with a coffee/juice bar) opening in Upper Montclair&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=,10%2C%20Montclair\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt; to nutrition-focused cafes popping up, residents embraced a &lt;em&gt;“healthy acorn, healthy life”&lt;/em&gt; philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In town government, Montclair’s Department of Health and Human Services continued outreach on everything from flu clinics to senior services. They promoted free &lt;strong&gt;COVID-19 booster&lt;/strong&gt; pop-ups and heart health screenings at the YMCA. And remembering that &lt;em&gt;mental&lt;/em&gt; health is health, local groups hosted workshops on stress relief and mindfulness. Montclair ended 2025 with &lt;strong&gt;no major public health crises&lt;/strong&gt; and a renewed commitment to community well-being – a healthy harvest indeed.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;ACB – Local Business Acorns&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downtown Bloom:&lt;/strong&gt; Montclair’s business district &lt;strong&gt;burst with fresh energy&lt;/strong&gt; this year. The historic &lt;strong&gt;Lackawanna Station redevelopment&lt;/strong&gt; officially opened as a new shopping and dining hub, welcoming over 20 new businesses under its restored 1913 roof&lt;a href=\"https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:%7E:text=,com\"&gt;thedailysquirrel.substack.com&lt;/a&gt;. The grand opening in June featured live music, art, kids’ activities, and free samples – marking a major infusion of economic acorns into our community’s stash&lt;a href=\"https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:%7E:text=,com\"&gt;thedailysquirrel.substack.com&lt;/a&gt;. Residents and visitors have been exploring the &lt;strong&gt;food hall and marketplace&lt;/strong&gt;, where independent vendors now buzz in a space that sat empty for years. Montclair’s landmark train station has been reborn as a one-stop destination for artisanal eats, local crafts, and even a weekly farmer’s market vibe. It’s a &lt;em&gt;track&lt;/em&gt; record we’re proud of!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Nuts in Town:&lt;/strong&gt; 2025 was a banner year for new businesses – over &lt;strong&gt;30+ shops, cafes, and studios opened&lt;/strong&gt; in Montclair and nearby&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=2025%20was%20a%20massive%20year,and%20Essex%20County%20in%202025\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. On Bloomfield Avenue alone, the diversity is delicious. We got a taste of world-class fine dining when &lt;em&gt;Iron Chef&lt;/em&gt; Masaharu &lt;strong&gt;Morimoto&lt;/strong&gt; opened &lt;strong&gt;“MM by Morimoto”&lt;/strong&gt; in July, an elegant Japanese restaurant with an omakase bar and sushi flown in from overseas&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=,193%20Glenridge%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. (It’s reservation-only and the talk of the town for date nights.) Right next door, Morimoto’s team also debuted &lt;strong&gt;OEN&lt;/strong&gt;, a swanky cocktail lounge and 12-seat omakase speakeasy in October&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=,Avenue\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt; – proving Montclair can attract culinary heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Montclair’s dining scene keeps growing – the interior of a new Bloomfield Avenue restaurant, Sam’s Table, which opened in fall 2025 with a vegetable-forward menu and chic decor. Local foodies are already flocking here for its seasonal small plates and modern vibe.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=,Bloomfield%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-august-10-2025/#:%7E:text=the%20Montclair%20news%20to%20keep,week%20ending%20August%2010th%2C%202025\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, homegrown entrepreneurs filled our town’s niches. &lt;strong&gt;Mashed Burgers&lt;/strong&gt;, a New Jersey-based halal burger joint, flipped its first patties here in March – bringing smash burgers, shakes and fries to Bloomfield Ave for comfort-food lovers&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=,Bloomfield%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;El Gordo Peruvian Eatery&lt;/strong&gt;, a family-run restaurant, introduced bold Peruvian flavors (ceviche! lomo saltado!) to Orange Road after opening its Montclair outpost in March&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=,324B%20Orange%20Road%2C%20Montclair\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. Coffee connoisseurs rejoiced as &lt;strong&gt;Qahwah House&lt;/strong&gt; (brewing aromatic Yemeni coffee with cardamom and honeyed pastries) opened in February&lt;a href=\"https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:%7E:text=around%20town%2C%20adding%20to%20Montclair%E2%80%99s,plus%20shakes\"&gt;thedailysquirrel.substack.com&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;787 Coffee&lt;/strong&gt; brought Puerto Rican brews to town&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=,Bloomfield%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. For those with a sweet tooth, Somedays Bakery began serving Parisian-style croissants on Bellevue Ave in June&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=,Bellevue%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. The Montclair Girl reports that from &lt;strong&gt;bakeries and fine dining to fitness studios and boutiques, 2025’s newcomers truly ran the gamut&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=2025%20was%20a%20massive%20year,and%20Essex%20County%20in%202025\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. It’s proof that Montclair’s acorn economy is &lt;strong&gt;thriving one new business at a time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:%7E:text=themontclairgirl,new%20business%20at%20a%20time\"&gt;thedailysquirrel.substack.com&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Hopes &amp;amp; Green Shoots:&lt;/strong&gt; In a milestone for Montclair’s &lt;em&gt;budding&lt;/em&gt; cannabis sector, &lt;strong&gt;The Kush Connection&lt;/strong&gt;dispensary finally won Planning Board approval on June 30th&lt;a href=\"https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:%7E:text=,%E2%80%9Cbudding%E2%80%9D%20business%20open%20its%20doors\"&gt;thedailysquirrel.substack.com&lt;/a&gt;. After a year of squirreling through red tape, this recreational cannabis shop will set up at 665 Bloomfield Avenue (a former auto dealership) with plans to open in 2026&lt;a href=\"https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:%7E:text=,Montclair%E2%80%99s%20enterprising%20squirrels\"&gt;thedailysquirrel.substack.com&lt;/a&gt;. The approval – which came with lively debate about parking and signage – adds “green acorns” to our local economy. Enthusiastic support from residents (and a punny Planning Board hearing or two) indicates Montclair is ready to &lt;strong&gt;embrace this new industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:%7E:text=of%20chatter%20about%20parking%20and,acorns%E2%80%9D%20to%20the%20local%20economy\"&gt;thedailysquirrel.substack.com&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere, the trend of mobile businesses rolled on: Woofie’s Pet Service launched a new mobile pet-grooming van at Montclair’s Pride Festival&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:%7E:text=The%20pet%20service%20company%20Woofie%E2%80%99s,new%20mobile%20van%2C%20which%20serves\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;, bringing &lt;em&gt;on-demand&lt;/em&gt; pampering to local pups. From tech-driven services to mom-and-pop shops, Montclair’s entrepreneurial spirit stayed &lt;strong&gt;strong and diverse&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t all smooth sailing – a few beloved businesses did close or move. A century-old Catholic store shut its doors, and some pandemic-era pop-ups ended their runs. But overall, 2025’s business climate was &lt;strong&gt;nutritious&lt;/strong&gt;. Montclair’s &lt;strong&gt;office of Small Business Advocacy&lt;/strong&gt; helped new owners navigate permits, and the Shop Local campaigns during the holidays kept cash registers ringing. With a &lt;em&gt;dizzying array&lt;/em&gt; of restaurants, cafés, retail boutiques (inclusive lingerie at &lt;strong&gt;Greymade&lt;/strong&gt; opened in January&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=their%20travels%2C%20art%2C%20and%20their,backgrounds%20in%20television%20and%20movies\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;!), and wellness studios, Montclair’s local business sector felt like &lt;strong&gt;a well-mixed trail mix&lt;/strong&gt; – a little of everything, and plenty to crunch on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;ACT – Local Tech Acorns&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Montclair might be known for arts and eats, but 2025 proved we’ve got &lt;strong&gt;tech chops&lt;/strong&gt; in our tree, too. The town’s young innovators made us proud: &lt;strong&gt;Montclair High School’s Robotics Team 555&lt;/strong&gt; had an award-winning season, clinching the Quality Award at the Mount Olive FRC competition and a Creativity Award at Warren Hills&lt;a href=\"https://www.montclairrobotics.org/#:%7E:text=FRC%20Team%20555%20%C2%B7%202025,Warren%20Hills%3B%20and%20Creativity\"&gt;montclairrobotics.org&lt;/a&gt;. These budding engineers (90+ students strong) designed a robot named “Riptide” to compete in FIRST Robotics Challenge, showing that STEM is thriving in our schools. Their semi-finals run and trophy haul underscored Montclair’s reputation for &lt;strong&gt;hands-on tech education&lt;/strong&gt;. Talk about &lt;em&gt;high-tech squirrels&lt;/em&gt; – these students are the acorns that will grow into future engineers and coders.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Local entrepreneurs also blended tech with community needs. At Montclair’s Pride Festival in June, &lt;strong&gt;Woofie’s Montclair&lt;/strong&gt; unveiled a high-tech mobile pet care van (essentially a pet spa on wheels) to serve busy owners&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:%7E:text=The%20pet%20service%20company%20Woofie%E2%80%99s,new%20mobile%20van%2C%20which%20serves\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was a hit, and signals how local services are embracing technology – from app-based booking to GPS-enabled mobile vans – to make life easier for residents and their furry friends. Montclair’s small businesses increasingly use e-commerce, delivery apps, and social media marketing as part of their toolkit, keeping our township &lt;strong&gt;plugged into the digital economy&lt;/strong&gt;. Even the corner farmstand might take Apple Pay now – truly a &lt;em&gt;new breed&lt;/em&gt; of convenience.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Montclair welcomed a &lt;strong&gt;global creative tech community&lt;/strong&gt; into its midst. This summer, the worldwide speaker series &lt;strong&gt;CreativeMornings&lt;/strong&gt; launched its &lt;strong&gt;first New Jersey chapter right here in Montclair&lt;/strong&gt;, hosting free monthly talks for local techies, designers, and innovators&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-august-10-2025/#:%7E:text=the%20Montclair%20news%20to%20keep,week%20ending%20August%2010th%2C%202025\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. Held at (where else?) Lackawanna Plaza’s new co-working space, these gatherings connect Montclair’s creative professionals with big ideas and each other. It’s like TED Talks meets networking over coffee, and it cements Montclair’s status as a &lt;strong&gt;regional innovation hub&lt;/strong&gt; – no need to trek to Brooklyn or Silicon Alley when we have it in our backyard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On the municipal side, Montclair continued upgrading its tech infrastructure. The township’s revamped website (launched late 2024) made it easier to pay taxes, report issues, and stream Council meetings online – no more buffering, hooray! And plans are afoot to pilot &lt;strong&gt;smart parking meters&lt;/strong&gt; that accept contactless payments downtown. Montclair’s public library added more Wi-Fi hotspots for loan and hosted coding workshops for teens. In short, our community kept one foot in tradition and one in the future. By the end of 2025, Montclair’s local tech scene proved that even a &lt;strong&gt;small town can think big&lt;/strong&gt; – whether it’s students building robots, or entrepreneurs coding the next startup in a Church Street café. The acorns of innovation are planted, and we’re excited to see them sprout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;ACE – Education Acorns&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Classrooms, Changes &amp;amp; Celebrations:&lt;/strong&gt; Montclair’s education landscape saw big shifts in 2025. In June, the town bid a fond (and bittersweet) farewell to &lt;strong&gt;Immaculate Conception High School&lt;/strong&gt;, which &lt;strong&gt;closed its doors after 100 years&lt;/strong&gt; of educating Montclair’s youth&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:%7E:text=Image%3A%20lackawanna#:%7E:text=After%20100%20Years%20in%20Operation%2C,High%20School%20Closes%20in%20Montclair\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. Generations of alumni and faculty reflected on the legacy of ICHS – a cherished Catholic institution that shaped countless lives. As the Archdiocese made the difficult decision citing enrollment and financial challenges, the community honored Immaculate’s century of service at a final mass and reunion. It’s truly the end of an era on Cottage Place, and Montclair loses a little piece of its history with that blue-and-white Mustang mascot. &lt;em&gt;Good night, Immaculate,&lt;/em&gt; and thank you for a century of acorns planted in young hearts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the public schools, &lt;strong&gt;financial drama&lt;/strong&gt; took center stage. The Montclair School District uncovered a &lt;strong&gt;$19.6 million budget shortfall&lt;/strong&gt; spanning last year and this year – a “surprise” deficit that had parents and officials scrambling&lt;a href=\"https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:%7E:text=,Reported\"&gt;montclairpod.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:%7E:text=%E2%80%9CIt%20may%20take%20a%20hybrid,the%20state%20to%20stay%20afloat\"&gt;montclairpod.com&lt;/a&gt;. By October, Superintendent Dr. Ruth Turner and Interim Business Administrator Dana Sullivan held town hall meetings to explain the dire numbers. The debt forced some tough choices: Montclair sought an emergency infusion of $12+ million (one-time) and even floated a special referendum to raise taxes for another $7 million&lt;a href=\"https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:%7E:text=Interim%20Business%20Administrator%20Dana%20Sullivan,would%20be%20a%20recurring%20expense\"&gt;montclairpod.com&lt;/a&gt;. Voters braced for the possibility of a December tax increase vote – and state monitors looming if we took a loan&lt;a href=\"https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:%7E:text=Two%20main%20paths%20forward%20were,presented\"&gt;montclairpod.com&lt;/a&gt;. Emotions ran high as parents asked if sports or preschool might face cuts&lt;a href=\"https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:%7E:text=The%20most%20moving%20moment%20came,be%20on%20the%20chopping%20block\"&gt;montclairpod.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:%7E:text=,licenses%20and%20returning%20to%20textbooks\"&gt;montclairpod.com&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the Board of Education pursued a hybrid solution of state help and taxpayer support to fill the gap. The crisis did claim one casualty: the &lt;strong&gt;district’s Business Administrator resigned&lt;/strong&gt; effective July 1, after a series of unpaid bills and late notices came to light&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:%7E:text=Montclair%E2%80%99s%20School%20Business%20Administrator%20Resigns%2C,Effective%207%2F1\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. By year’s end, Montclair’s schools were under closer scrutiny and an independent forensic audit was underway to ensure this &lt;em&gt;nutty fiasco&lt;/em&gt; never repeats. It was a teachable moment in fiscal accountability (and perhaps a cautionary tale about not hiding acorns for too long!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On a brighter note, Montclair’s students and teachers achieved plenty to celebrate. Aside from robotics victories, our &lt;strong&gt;high school’s drama club&lt;/strong&gt; clinched a state award for their fall musical, and several Montclair teens became National Merit Scholarship semifinalists. In academics, Montclair High continued its renowned Magnet program, and Montclair Kimberley Academy (MKA) launched a new interdisciplinary STEM curriculum this year. &lt;strong&gt;Montclair State University&lt;/strong&gt; had a milestone as well: Congresswoman (and alumna) Mikie Sherrill gave the commencement address in May, inspiring graduates as she herself transitioned to a new role (more on that later!). MSU also mobilized its &lt;strong&gt;PSEG Sustainability Institute Green Teams&lt;/strong&gt; – student interns who worked with the Montclair township on environmental projects like home energy audits&lt;a href=\"https://www.sustainablejersey.com/news/newsletters/2025/fall-2025/#:%7E:text=Interns%20from%20the%20PSEG%20Institute,at%20the%20Montclair%20Farmers%E2%80%99%20Market\"&gt;sustainablejersey.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.sustainablejersey.com/news/newsletters/2025/fall-2025/#:%7E:text=sustainability%20and%20energy\"&gt;sustainablejersey.com&lt;/a&gt;. This “town-gown” collaboration enriched both the community and the students’ learning, showcasing the value of having a major university in our backyard.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In community education, local nonprofits expanded enrichment programs. &lt;em&gt;Latinos of Montclair&lt;/em&gt; launched “Ritmo Jardín,” a summer cultural program teaching kids percussion, Spanish vocabulary and Latin dance at the YMCA&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:%7E:text=Latinos%20of%20Montclair%20Launches%20New,Summer%20Cultural%20Enrichment%20Program\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. The Montclair Public Library hosted packed houses for its “Little Read” event in the spring and added a new digital media lab for teens. And Montclair’s Adult School (now in its 90th year) continued offering everything from ceramics to coding to hundreds of lifelong learners. Despite challenges, the &lt;strong&gt;spirit of learning remained strong&lt;/strong&gt;. As Superintendent Turner said, this deficit is not the end of our story&lt;a href=\"https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:%7E:text=,for%20the%20current%20academic%20year\"&gt;montclairpod.com&lt;/a&gt; – Montclair is working “side by side to protect what matters most: the learning, growth, and well-being of our students”&lt;a href=\"https://montclairpod.com/montclairs-20m-school-deficit-explained/#:%7E:text=,for%20the%20current%20academic%20year\"&gt;montclairpod.com&lt;/a&gt;. Class dismissed, 2025 – and here’s to a wiser 2026.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;NUT – General Tech &amp;amp; Innovation Acorns&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Beyond our local scene, Montclair’s economy in 2025 was influenced by broader tech and innovation trends – often in quirky ways. Take &lt;strong&gt;“eggflation”&lt;/strong&gt;, for example (or rather the lack thereof): after nationwide egg prices &lt;strong&gt;skyrocketed in 2023&lt;/strong&gt;, this year they finally normalized, leading to what we playfully dubbed &lt;strong&gt;“reverse eggflation.”&lt;/strong&gt; As one Acorn report put it, local value increased even while national groceries cheapened&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1jzpfcu/acorn_economy_week_2/#:%7E:text=Acorn%20Economy%20,comes%20to%20a%20close\"&gt;reddit.com&lt;/a&gt;, meaning Montclair families paid a lot less for their omelets and holiday baking. Cheaper eggs and milk might not sound like tech, but improved supply chains (thanks to data-driven logistics and maybe fewer avian flu scares) played a role. We tracked our own &lt;strong&gt;“eggs-per-acorn”&lt;/strong&gt; metric for fun, noting how many dozen eggs one Acorn Index unit could buy – and let’s just say by year’s end, the &lt;em&gt;yolks were on inflation&lt;/em&gt;. This quirky indicator underscored a serious positive: &lt;strong&gt;household staples became more affordable&lt;/strong&gt;, giving residents a little more cushion to spend on other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tech innovation also touched Montclair in the form of &lt;strong&gt;transportation and energy advances&lt;/strong&gt;. New Jersey doubled down on electric vehicles and green tech in 2025. The NJDEP rolled out rules requiring increasing sales of &lt;strong&gt;electric trucks after 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, pushing automakers toward zero-emission models&lt;a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/newjerseydep/posts/-dep-is-leading-the-charge-on-electric-vehicles-in-new-jersey-this-driveelectric/1249553980549143/#:%7E:text=DEP%20is%20leading%20the%20charge,DEP%20is%20leading%20by\"&gt;facebook.com&lt;/a&gt;. Montclair’s own delivery fleets and public works vehicles are eyeing electrification; already our recycling trucks run on cleaner fuels, and EV charging stations popped up in more public lots for residents switching to Teslas and Bolts. Statewide, investment in offshore wind and solar energy ramped up (you might have noticed those turbine parts being trucked down Bloomfield Ave en route to the coast!). These big innovations will mean a greener grid feeding Montclair homes in coming years – and possibly lower energy bills, too.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;strong&gt;tech business scene&lt;/strong&gt;, the New York metropolitan area’s growth spilled into Montclair. We saw more remote tech workers moving here for the suburban charm and fiber-optic internet, turning cafes into weekday coworking spots. A few Montclair-based startups gained traction: one local app developer, for instance, won a regional pitch contest for an AI-driven personal shopping app. And Montclair hosted an &lt;strong&gt;Innovation Night&lt;/strong&gt; at the Wellmont Arts Plaza in October, where inventors and entrepreneurs demoed creations like smart home devices and eco-friendly packaging designs. The event – part-science fair, part-networking – highlighted the &lt;strong&gt;creative brainpower&lt;/strong&gt; in our community. Jazz House Kids even had a booth showing off a student-built electronic instrument.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Finally, on the policy side, Montclair kept an eye on tariffs and trade winds. Global supply chain improvements meant holiday gifts were easier to find (no repeat of last year’s toy shortage), and local bike shops finally got those backordered parts. While international issues like computer chip tariffs didn’t hit Montclair directly, our residents benefited from the general easing of shortages. New car lots actually had cars again, and prices for used cars came down from Mars. In summary, 2025’s big tech and innovation currents – from &lt;strong&gt;EV adoption&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;AI apps&lt;/strong&gt; – reached our oak-tree-lined streets in subtle but important ways. Montclair is nothing if not adaptable, and our squirrels are quick studies when it comes to new gadgets and ideas. If the Acorn Index is any indication, we’re &lt;strong&gt;charging into the future&lt;/strong&gt; (sometimes literally, in our new EVs) with curiosity and savvy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;LUX – Lifestyle &amp;amp; Leisure Acorns&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Life in Montclair was as vibrant as ever in 2025 – a year filled with &lt;strong&gt;street fairs, stage lights, and community spirit.&lt;/strong&gt; Our cultural calendar overflowed with events that brought out &lt;strong&gt;thousands of residents and visitors&lt;/strong&gt; (and not just for the free samples!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The summer’s crown jewel was the &lt;strong&gt;Montclair Jazz Festival&lt;/strong&gt;, which returned bigger and bolder than ever. After a season of smaller concerts and Soundcheck shows, the Festival culminated in the &lt;strong&gt;Downtown Jamboree on September 13th&lt;/strong&gt; – an all-day, open-air jazz extravaganza that literally stopped traffic. Bloomfield Avenue around Lackawanna Plaza transformed into a concert arena, with &lt;em&gt;three stages&lt;/em&gt; of live music, a dance floor in the street, and over &lt;strong&gt;150 food and artisan vendors&lt;/strong&gt; fueling the fun&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:%7E:text=There%20will%20be%20over%20150%2B,Jazz%20Discovery%20Zone%2C%20and%20more\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. An estimated &lt;strong&gt;26,000 attendees&lt;/strong&gt; filled downtown (yes, you read that right – it’s now the &lt;strong&gt;largest free jazz fest in the NYC region&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;a href=\"https://www.montclairjazzfestival.org/become-a-vendor#:%7E:text=\"&gt;montclairjazzfestival.org&lt;/a&gt;. From noon to night, world-class artists like Lakecia Benjamin, Jazzmeia Horn, Christian McBride’s band, and the Gotham Kings blew the crowd away&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:%7E:text=merchandise\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:%7E:text=Headliners%20for%20the%20event%20include,generational%20quintet\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. Families camped out with lawn chairs, kids got their faces painted in the Family Jazz Discovery Zone, and our own Montclair Brewery unveiled a special “Jazz Ale” for the occasion&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:%7E:text=There%20will%20be%20over%20150%2B,Jazz%20Discovery%20Zone%2C%20and%20more\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. As twilight fell, the Block Party kept grooves going with DJ Brother Mister (a.k.a. Christian McBride in a DJ booth) spinning tunes&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-jazz-festival-2025/#:%7E:text=Zone%2C%20and%20more\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. The 14th annual Montclair Jazz Festival truly hit a new high note – &lt;strong&gt;a Golden Acorn moment&lt;/strong&gt; for sure (spoiler!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Musicians heat up the stage at the 2025 Montclair Jazz Festival Downtown Jamboree. The free September event drew an estimated 26,000 people to downtown Montclair for 8+ hours of live jazz across multiple stages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.montclairjazzfestival.org/become-a-vendor#:%7E:text=\"&gt;&lt;em&gt;montclairjazzfestival.org&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It’s now hailed as one of the region’s premier music festivals – and it’s all right here in Montclair!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Not to be outdone, June brought the &lt;strong&gt;4th Annual Montclair Pride Festival&lt;/strong&gt;, organized by Out Montclair. On June 14th, downtown was awash in rainbow flags and joyous crowds as this &lt;em&gt;inclusive celebration&lt;/em&gt; took over Bloomfield Avenue. After successful festivals in 2022, 2023, and 2024, the &lt;strong&gt;2025 Pride Festival featured live entertainment on three stages and 200+ vendors&lt;/strong&gt; ranging from food trucks to local artists&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:%7E:text=match%20at%20L399%20The%204th,drink%20vendors%2C%20food%20trucks%2C%20LGBTQ\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. It was officially recognized as one of the top suburban Pride events in the nation&lt;a href=\"https://www.montclairnjusa.org/Visitors/Things-to-Do/Special-Events/Montclair-Pride-Festival#:%7E:text=%23%20Montclair%20Pride%20Festival%20,June%2014th\"&gt;montclairnjusa.org&lt;/a&gt; – and you could tell, from the incredible lineup (Dominique Jackson of &lt;em&gt;Pose&lt;/em&gt; was a host!) to the huge turnout of families, teens, and allies. There was dancing in the streets (quite literally during the evening street dance party), and a moving equality rally by local leaders. Montclair once again proved itself a beacon of love and diversity, with residents coming together to &lt;strong&gt;amplify LGBTQ+ voices and stories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.montclairnjusa.org/Visitors/Things-to-Do/Special-Events/Montclair-Pride-Festival#:%7E:text=We%20invite%20all%20families%20to,celebrating%20diverse%20identities%20and%20backgrounds\"&gt;montclairnjusa.org&lt;/a&gt;. And yes, &lt;strong&gt;Woofie’s pet van&lt;/strong&gt;making its debut at Pride – only in Montclair do we combine pet pampering with Pride partying!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our town’s beloved traditions continued to thrive. On July 4th, Montclair hosted the region’s &lt;strong&gt;largest Independence Day parade&lt;/strong&gt;, complete with marching bands, vintage cars, creative floats, and community groups winding down Bloomfield Avenue&lt;a href=\"https://thedailysquirrel.substack.com/p/acorn-economy-june-26th-july-3rd#:%7E:text=,Grand%20Marshal%20was%20the%20Montclair\"&gt;thedailysquirrel.substack.com&lt;/a&gt;. The parade – an annual highlight since 1947 – drew big crowds (water squirt guns and all), followed by a family picnic and fireworks at Yogi Berra Stadium. In early June, the &lt;strong&gt;Montclair African American Heritage Parade &amp;amp; Festival&lt;/strong&gt; returned to a festive atmosphere, celebrating Black culture with step dancers, drumlines, and local legends as Grand Marshals. From the &lt;strong&gt;Greek Festival&lt;/strong&gt; at St. Demetrios Church (opa!) to Montclair’s &lt;strong&gt;Oktoberfest&lt;/strong&gt; block party at Walnut Street, there was never a dull weekend.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Arts and film were also in the limelight. &lt;strong&gt;Montclair Film Festival 2025&lt;/strong&gt; took place in October, drawing filmmakers and cinema buffs for 10 days of screenings at the Clairidge and Wellmont. Buzz was particularly strong for a certain Netflix production that filmed a scene at Montclair High School over the summer&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-july-6-2025/#:%7E:text=Image%3A%20lackawanna#:%7E:text=Montclair%20,2025%20Property%20Taxes%20Introduced%20in\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt; – yes, &lt;em&gt;Adam Sandler&lt;/em&gt; was in town, producing a coming-of-age movie. (Local rumor: Sandler popped into a Watchung Plaza deli during filming. Montclair: where Hollywood meets hoagies.) The &lt;strong&gt;Montclair Art Museum&lt;/strong&gt; launched a critically acclaimed exhibit of Charles White’s drawings in the fall, and hosted free First Thursdays that brought art lovers together. Even our historic &lt;strong&gt;Bellevue Theatre&lt;/strong&gt; in Upper Montclair got a new lease on life – Montclair Film and Clairidge Cinema struck an agreement to reopen the 1922 movie palace soon&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=,Bellevue%20Avenue%2C%20Montclair\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;, sparking excitement for its grand return (indie films and popcorn under that iconic marquee, here we come!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From dining to nightlife, lifestyle in Montclair kept pace with the fun. &lt;strong&gt;Restaurant Week 2025&lt;/strong&gt; in September saw record participation – over 50 eateries offered specials, from fancy pre-fixe dinners to casual cafe deals, feeding both our bellies and our sense of community. New nightlife spots like &lt;strong&gt;Boozie’s Wine Shoppe &amp;amp; Bar&lt;/strong&gt; at Lackawanna Station became the go-to for a laid-back evening sip&lt;a href=\"https://www.themontclairgirl.com/new-businesses-montclair-2025/#:%7E:text=,1%20Lackawanna%20Plaza%2C%20Montclair\"&gt;themontclairgirl.com&lt;/a&gt;. And let’s not forget our parks and outdoors: this year a new pollinator garden opened at Edgemont Park thanks to local volunteers, and the &lt;em&gt;Montclair Running Company&lt;/em&gt; hosted monthly fun runs drawing dozens of health-conscious neighbors. For a “quiet” suburb, Montclair sure knows how to live it up. &lt;strong&gt;Lifestyle in 2025 was LUX indeed&lt;/strong&gt; – luxurious not just in a material way, but in the richness of experiences. Whether you were dancing at a festival, enjoying a gallery opening, or simply people-watching at Church Street Café, Montclair provided a &lt;strong&gt;vibrant, inclusive, and never-boring home&lt;/strong&gt; for all of us.&lt;a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Jersey_gubernatorial_election#:%7E:text=The%202025%20New%20Jersey%20gubernatorial,limited\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "# Braces vs. Invisalign: The \"Cheat Sheet\" for Parents in Broward County (Don't waste $$)\n\nMost parents in South Florida are guessing when it comes to their teen’s teeth.\n\nThey pick one option based on what their neighbor in Weston did, or what they saw on TikTok. Then they end up surprised when treatment takes 6 months longer than expected.\n\nI’m a Board-Certified Orthodontist in Miramar. I see thousands of cases.\n\nHere is the **no-fluff framework** we use at **SMILE-FX** to help families decide between Braces and Invisalign. Use this to make the right call for your kid.\n\n***\n\n## 🛑 The \"Real Talk\" Comparison\n\nIf your teen goes to **Cypress Bay, Western High, or Douglas**, they probably want Invisalign because it's invisible. But as a parent, you care about **results** and **cost**.\n\nHere is the raw data breakdown:\n\n| Factor | 😬 Braces (The Heavy Lifters) | ✨ Invisalign (The Flexible Choice) |\n|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| **Timeframe** | 18-24 Months | 12-18 Months (**IF** worn 22hrs/day) |\n| **Compliance** | 100% (They can't lose them) | Depends on the kid (Must wear 22hrs/day) |\n| **Sports** | Needs Mouthguard (Can cut lips) | Removable (Safe for contact sports) |\n| **Visibility** | Metal/Ceramic (Visible) | Clear (Invisible) |\n| **Price (Avg)** | $4,500 - $7,000 | $4,000 - $6,500 |\n| **Best For** | Complex bites &amp; \"forgetful\" teens | Active athletes &amp; responsible teens |\n\n***\n\n## 🧠 Which one actually works?\n\nIt depends on the **Case** and the **Kid**.\n\n### 1. The Case for Braces (The \"Set It and Forget It\" Model)\nTraditional braces are the undefeated champion for complex cases (severe crowding/bite issues).\n*   **Why we recommend them:** They apply constant force. The teen doesn't have to \"remember\" to do anything.\n*   **The Tech Upgrade:** At SMILE-FX, we use **AI-precision bracket bonding**. Less discomfort, fewer adjustments.\n\n### 2. The Case for Invisalign (The \"Lifestyle\" Model)\nIdeal for the active teen. If they are in the band, play football, or hit the beach every weekend, this is the winner.\n*   **The Risk:** If they don't wear it for 20-22 hours a day, treatment stalls.\n*   **The Fix:** We use **Ortho-FX** with remote monitoring. We track progress via scans so you don't have to drive into the office every month. **Cuts visits by 40%.**\n\n***\n\n## 🚗 \"Is the drive to Miramar worth it?\"\n\nWe get parents driving from all over because we avoid the \"dental mill\" vibe. We are owner-operated and Board Certified.\n\nHere is the actual commute time to our studio (with free parking):\n*   **Cooper City:** 8 mins (Interactive Map)\n*   **Pembroke Pines:** 10 mins (Easy shot down Pines Blvd)\n*   **Weston:** 12 mins (Skip the local wait times)\n*   **Hollywood/Davie:** 15 mins (Quick I-95/Uni access)\n*   **Fort Lauderdale:** 20 mins (Worth it for airway-focused treatments)\n\n***\n\n## ⚡ The Verdict\n\n**Choose Braces if:** Your teen loses their car keys, has a complex bite, or you want zero argument about \"putting your trays in.\"\n\n**Choose Invisalign if:** Your teen is responsible, plays contact sports, or requires a camera-ready smile.\n\n### Want to stop guessing?\nWe do **Free 3D Scans &amp; Consultations**. No pressure, just data.\n\n👉 **[Book your teen's Free Consult here](https://smile-fx.com/lp/virtual-consult/)**\n📍 **[Check our Miramar Location](https://smile-fx.com/contact-us/)**\n\n***\n\n### 🙋‍♂️ FAQ (Speed Round)\n\n**Q: Can they play sports with braces?**\nA: Yes, but get a custom mouthguard. [More info here](https://smile-fx.com/braces/).\n\n**Q: How much faster is your tech?**\nA: Our data-driven plans (VIP Tech) often shave **4-6 months** off standard treatment times.\n\n**Q: Do you take insurance?**\nA: Yes, most major South Florida providers. We fight to maximize your benefits.\n\n**Q: Does Invisalign hurt?**\nA: First week? Mild soreness. After that? Easy sailing. [Resources here](https://smile-fx.com/patient-resources/).",

Looking for a class that uses a pottery wheel and has a teacher that comes around and helps with whatever you're trying to make and then you can paint it however you like afterwards.\n\nThank you so much for any suggestions!!",

Thank you to everyone who commented on and upvoted this post. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you guys. Seriously. I am so, so grateful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

We weren’t exactly poor growing up, but financial literacy in the family wasn’t the best, like the idea of saving wasn’t through investing but by hiding cash behind a wall panel. My grandpa was super frugal so this makes sense, but it still comes as a surprise because we never knew about the land while he was alive. \n\nMy sibling and I took some personal finance classes in college to gain a better understanding because we’d seen some poor financial decisions made on our parents behalf, and now after receiving this news years later we’ve been discussing how we can invest it. \n\nMy sibling and I are both in our early 20’s, finishing undergrad, but I’m studying to become a therapist which would require a masters degree. I’ll have around 70k student debt but my projected income could be anywhere between 80k-120k+ in my province after grad school. I’ve been living comfortably off 2k a month since I have a roommate. I have no credit card debt or anything else, just preparing for the years it will take to finish undergrad plus my masters, which is about 4 years.\n\nI have a home art studio and have been selling ceramics for a couple years while I’ve been studying. It’s my dream to incorporate the arts into my therapy practice in the future. I’ve done some work at rehabilitation centres and love assisting art therapists, but I would like to build a foundation for my own future practice. \n\nAside from maxing out my TFSA, FHSA, and putting a bit into my RRSP, what other investment can I consider? I know this isn’t enough to live off of but it’s enough to set a foundation for my future after graduation and also potentially fix my deviated septum which could help with my asthma. \n\nWe’ve set a meeting with a financial advisor already, but would like to hear about other options. Thanks!",

Professor Hassan Ashkanani of Kuwait University described the discovery as a landmark for Failaka Island, shedding light on the transition from the Christian period to early Islam.\n\nThe finds include Syriac and Persian inscriptions on ostraca, coins, an ornate perfume bottle, and food-processing installations, offering rare insight into daily, economic, and religious life on the island more than 1,200 years ago.\n\nFrench mission supervisor Dr. Julie Bonneric said the site includes a monastery with a large church, refectory, and extensive food-preparation complex, highlighting evidence of Christian-Islamic coexistence during the early Islamic era.She added that the current excavation season-the 12th-began on Nov. 17, 2025, and focuses on the monastery's earliest phase and the daily lives of its monks.\n\n\nMembers of the Kuwaiti archaeological team Saif Al-Batti Boutaiban, Ahmad Al-Thawadi, and Anwar Al-Tamimi, said that among the most notable discoveries was a food-processing building opposite the church. The team uncovered a flour mill featuring two low mud-brick pillars designed to support rotating grinding stones.\n\nThey explained that part of the grinding equipment was made from local stone, likely sourced from Failaka Island, while other grinding stones were produced from artificial basalt. Although this material closely resembles natural basalt rock, it was manufactured from clay and sand and fired at extremely high temperatures in large kilns. This advanced process, known as \"pyrotechnology,\" involved melting and recrystallizing materials to replicate the mechanical properties of volcanic basalt.\n\n",

Professor Hassan Ashkanani of Kuwait University described the discovery as a landmark for Failaka Island, shedding light on the transition from the Christian period to early Islam.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The finds include Syriac and Persian inscriptions on ostraca, coins, an ornate perfume bottle, and food-processing installations, offering rare insight into daily, economic, and religious life on the island more than 1,200 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;French mission supervisor Dr. Julie Bonneric said the site includes a monastery with a large church, refectory, and extensive food-preparation complex, highlighting evidence of Christian-Islamic coexistence during the early Islamic era.She added that the current excavation season-the 12th-began on Nov. 17, 2025, and focuses on the monastery&amp;#39;s earliest phase and the daily lives of its monks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Members of the Kuwaiti archaeological team Saif Al-Batti Boutaiban, Ahmad Al-Thawadi, and Anwar Al-Tamimi, said that among the most notable discoveries was a food-processing building opposite the church. The team uncovered a flour mill featuring two low mud-brick pillars designed to support rotating grinding stones.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They explained that part of the grinding equipment was made from local stone, likely sourced from Failaka Island, while other grinding stones were produced from artificial basalt. Although this material closely resembles natural basalt rock, it was manufactured from clay and sand and fired at extremely high temperatures in large kilns. This advanced process, known as &amp;quot;pyrotechnology,&amp;quot; involved melting and recrystallizing materials to replicate the mechanical properties of volcanic basalt.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Pretty long line of 30+ people.  It seemed orderly, but some folks took a while to take their photo with it. Also, the line will take longer than it looks because people would rent a pedal boat and go right up to the shrine from the other side (the water), and take a photo with it.  Seems like a devious shortcut.  We didn’t need the ‘perfect shot’ so we just stood at the stairs area and took a selfie with it in the background.\n\n* **Hakone Shrine** - 3/5\n\n &gt; A few sets of stairs from the Peace Torii, this shrine was popular among samurai.  Check it out if you’re already here for the Peace Torii.\n\n* **Hakone sightseeing cruise** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Basically comes with the Hakone Freepass; take it if you intend on doing the loop.  Nothing too special about it, I would try to get to the exit as the ship approaches land, because you’ll be ‘competing’ with everyone else to get to the ropeway (assuming you decided to loop clockwise).  There’s a first class ticket you can get, seems like you get a special seating area and enter via a separate line. \n\n* **Hakone Ropeway** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Also part of the Hakone Freepass and the loop.  The line is quite long but moves at a steady pace as people fill in the gondolas.  Excellent view of the area, unfortunately it was not clear enough to see Mt. Fuji that day.  Seeing the [vents/fumes from Owakudani](https://imgur.com/BMFumdu) from the gondolas was pretty neat.\n\n* **Owakudani** - 3/5\n\n &gt; The area itself was fairly cold given how high up we were.  It was cool to see the vents/fumes a little closer.  Would’ve been cool to do the trail tour to see things even more up-close, but it seemed to be open to Japanese-speakers in order to follow instructions in the case of an emergency.  I tried to still book it with a friend’s address but the GF didn’t feel comfortable with it, so we had to pass on it.\n\n* **Owakudani Kurotamagokan** - 3.5/5\n\n &gt; Gift shop with lots of regional food, as well as black egg-themed souvenirs such as Sanrio characters, socks, shirts, you name it.  There was a line wrapping around the perimeter of the store to buy the eggs boiled in sulfurous water.  The eggs were black, almost like a smooth, egg-shaped pumice stone; however, it looked like regular eggs once de-shelled, and tasted the same as well.  I would only get it for the novelty.\n\n* **Gokuraku Tea Shop** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Checked it out since we passed by it.  Had souvenirs, modern and more traditional, including the distinctive Hakone wood mosaics (yosegi), comprised of geometric patterns.\n\n* **Sounzan Station, and the bus back to Hakone-Yumoto Station**\n\n &gt; This is where things went awry on our trip.  To get back to Hakone-Yumoto Station, Google Maps said the fastest way was to take a bus from the stop a walk away from Sounzan Station.  The bus ended up being really late, an hour if I recall.  Also, it wasn’t covered by the Hakone Freepass, and the bus driver angrily (almost vehemently) told us this (in Japanese).  Despite showing I was willing to use my ICOCA to pay the fare, he gestured to us to take the cable car to Gora.  After he drove off, another bus pulled up (likely the next one, but due to traffic, ended up being 1 min apart rather than 30 minutes) and we got into this one via ICOCA fare.  Anyways, TERRIBLE traffic all the way back to Hakone-Yumoto, I’d estimate an hour once we were on the bus.  My advice regarding this is, once you’re done with the loop and you’ve seen &amp; done what you wanted, try to get to Hakone-Yumoto ASAP, the traffic seems to get worse as people start to leave the area for the day.\n\n# Hakone Food\n\n* **Gyokutei** - 4/5\n\n &gt; The ryokan we stayed at in Hakone came with dinner and breakfast.  Dinner was a traditional kaiseki, which came with shirako (fish sperm sac).  I couldn’t quite stomach it, but the rest of the dinners were quite tasty, very seafood-focused: scallop, oysterball, uni, tuna, amberjack, seabream, tofu, wagyu, taro, miso soup.  Breakfast was a [traditional breakfast](https://imgur.com/yF7EqCx) with a grilled whole horse mackerel, fish sausage, tamago, among other sides.  Very excellent.\n\n* **Hakone Cheese Terrace** - 5/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.49\n\n &gt; Per the GF, not too sweet, the right amount of creaminess but without feeling gross, which is a worry when going to Asian (cheese)cake places. basic is good, would want to try the other flavors next time.\n\n# Tokyo Activities\n\n* **[Tsukiji Outer Market](https://imgur.com/hmN9a5x)** - 2/5\n\n &gt; We walked by after breakfast to Tsumugi.  A good amount of tourists at 9:30am, some shops weren’t open.  Similar to Nishiki or Kuromon Market, lots of wagyu on a stick and other tourist trap-ish food are available.\n\n* **Ippodo Tea Ginza Mitsukoshi** - 3/5\n\n &gt; One of the department store basement locations.  The original is based in Kyoto (which I recommend going!); the brand is considered a purveyor of matcha to the imperial family.  Limit on matcha in place.  Got the fall seasonal matcha, and some hojicha.  There are at least 4 in the central Tokyo area, all department store basements.\n\n* **Itoya** - 4/5\n\n &gt; 4 stars for the casual, 5 for those into stationary as this is stationary heaven.  There’s a whole floor dedicated to fountain pens.  Other stuff include non-fountain pens, journals, paper, greeting cards, stickers, pretty much anything around stationary.  Staff are knowledgeable.  Most of the floors are pretty packed, so be prepared to ‘shuffle’ a little.\n\n* **Ginza LOFT** - 4/5\n\n &gt; LOFT is a chain store that’s kind of like a mix of Target and Muji, with a good amount of stationary and beauty products.  A little lifestyle-ish.  Definitely check it out, I dare you to walk out without buying less than ¥5000.  They have a tax-free counter as well!  Bought a whole bunch of candy, matcha supplies, and Apagard toothpaste.\n\n* **Hands** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Similar to LOFT, it’s a chain that has a variety of things.  It felt a little like a more upscale Daiso, with home improvement, kitchen, and craft supplies.  Definitely doesn’t feel ‘lifestyle’ like LOFT did.  We ended up not buying anything here (though going to LOFT first probably didn’t help).\n\n* **Wpc.** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Umbrella store.  It’s a popular Japanese brand, I saw it all over the LOFTs and Hands.  They have a lot of lightweight ones.  I was looking for their UV0 line, which was not in stock at LOFT/Hands due to it being a summer item.  I found it at the Wpc. flagship store.  They have several with designs like Pokemon and art.  Difficult to find, look very closely at the map, it’s underground.\n\n* **The [”Your Name” Stairs](https://imgur.com/7nWiBVd) (Suga Shrine Otokodan) / Suga Shrine** - 3/5\n\n &gt; It’s a bit out of the way, but if you want to see the stairs that were featured at the end of the movie Your Name, it’s this one.  There were a few folks here, but people weren’t hogging it, you take turns to grab your photo.  The shrine just across the little parking lot, it makes sense why it was chosen for the movie as it’s said to &gt;!protect against natural disasters!&lt;\n\n* **[Meiji Jingu Gaien Ginkgo Avenue](https://imgur.com/INm4j3F)** - 4.5/5\n\n &gt; 25 min walk from Suga Shrine.  Almost magical to see during the fall.  The street is lined up with gingko trees, with some [variation in the colors](https://imgur.com/1idt3vN).  If there’s a gust of wind, you can see the leaves falling.  This also meant it was had lots of people about, not shoulder-to-shoulder, but you won’t be able to get a people-less photo (if that matters to you).\n\n* **Shoyeido** - 5/5 (GF’s)\n\n &gt; Incense brand established in 1705 by a Kyoto Imperial Palace staff member.  Well-known brand with a shop in Ginza.\n\n* **Ancora** - 5/5 (GF’s)\n\n &gt; Per the GF, “lots of customizations, and Ancora-specific inks, great gifts for stationary lovers, expensive, be prepared to spend a lot”.  Ancora is Sailor’s flagship store, and has two special inks for sale, one only on a day with a full moon, and one during rainy days.\n\n* **Ghibli Museum** - 2/5\n\n &gt; The famous Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, near Kichijoji.  We went here blind, so we didn’t know what exhibits were here or anything.  The ‘beginning of movement’ room was quite interesting and thought-provoking (explaining how animation came about), I really enjoyed it.  Outside of that, I was quite let down.  I expected more ‘learning’ given ‘Museum’ was in its name.  There wasn’t too much to see, exhibits-wise, though I’m sure some of it had to do with the fact that the special exhibits room and book room were dedicated to Yuriko Yamawaki, a children’s book illustrator who seemed to have no direct connection to Studio Ghibli, and the featured short film wasn’t in the Studio Ghibli style I grew up watching (e.g. animation of a popular children’s book).  The room with Hayao’s ‘workshop’ and sketchbooks were interesting, but didn’t have any labels/signs/panels to explain things.  Personally, it feels a bit ‘incomplete’.  I think the only areas in the whole museum that had information about what we were seeing were 1) the [‘beginning of movement’](https://imgur.com/UvvwytS) room, and 2) a big one explaining the book illustrator’s biography.  In my opinion, unless you are a Studio Ghibli fan, I would skip this or at least deprioritize it, especially considering the hurdles (difficult to reserve, and somewhat out of the way).  Fortunately, the tickets were quite cheap.  I do think the spirit of the museum is captured in Hayao’s [thoughts here](https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/kind/), but I also think there’s only so much you can glean from just ‘looking’ (just my two cents).  My [reservation experience and tips](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1o32eo0/ghibli_museum_nov_2025_reservation_experience_tips/)\n\n* **BOOKOFF Kichijoji-eki-kitaguchi Store** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Last year, I didn’t have great success finding the volume 1’s of the popular manga (Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer, mainly) at the BOOKOFFs, but eventually found it at the Kichijoji BOOKOFF.  And like last year, I couldn’t find Dandadan and Kagurabachi until once again, Kichijoji’s.  Take that for what you will.\n\n* **Kitanomaru Park** - 3/5\n\n &gt; A nice park area near the Tokyo Imperial Palace, it has a great maple grove called [Momiji-bayashi](https://imgur.com/RmpHgCI), which is perfect to see the autumn foliage.  Lots of open space for a picnic.\n\n* **TOBICHI Tokyo** - 3.5/5\n\n &gt; Basically down the street from GLITCH COFFEE, this is Hobonichi’s Tokyo store.  It’s much easier to get to compared to Kyoto’s, and maybe double in size in terms of offerings.  The Junji Ito collab were sold out.  A must for Hobonichi/stationary fans.\n\n* **CARD WINGS** - 3/5\n\n &gt; A card shop I randomly browsed in Akihabara.  The Pokemon stuff were expensive like Osaka’s, but the Union Arena cards they had on display caught my eye.  They feature IP like Bleach, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Demon Slayer, so I picked some cheap ones (not sure if these were overpriced like Pokemon).\n\n* **[Tokyo National Museum](https://imgur.com/LyON6nK)** - 5/5\n\n &gt; Super impressive museum.  Showcases a lot of the cultural aspects of Japan, particularly around art.  Good amount of objects related to Buddhism.  Excellent collection of lacquer, and samurai-related objects.  My favorite part is the amount of information displayed on the wall when entering each room, and a good amount of objects had a description, purpose, etc.  You would need at least half a day just to go through it, and we didn’t even get a chance to go through the Heisekan and Toyokan galleries.  Kids might be bored here, but I think this would be great for an inquisitive middle/high schooler.  Tickets were only ¥1000, and appear to be free for anyone under 18.\n\n* **Meiji Jingu** - 4/5\n\n &gt; A Shinto shrine in the middle of a forest in the middle of Tokyo, which is impressive.  There was a wedding ceremony in procession (didn’t even know you could book Meiji Jingu of all places).  More interestingly, we came the day before the Niiname-sai (harvest festival), so there were [crops](https://imgur.com/3bZNcUa) and food lined up all along the wall, donated by farmers, businesses, and even a 5th grade class from an elementary school.  The grounds are quite large, and there’s a few things to see like the [wall of sake barrels](https://imgur.com/l3i3K1K), the Camphor Tree ‘couple’, [Torii gate](https://imgur.com/FmIVFZf), the garden, and a museum.\n\n* **Tokyo Christmas Market in Meiji Jingu** - 3/5\n\n &gt; There is an entry fee, but if you book online in advance, you get a mug.  Just a Christmas market in a park area.  The outside perimeter is comprised of food stalls, and the [inner stalls have merchandise](https://imgur.com/fefJoUp).  Everything did seem to be Christmas-oriented and mostly appear to be handmade.  There is a Christmas pyramid to take photos with.  There’s a stage with some random dancer/singers.  Good for kids I guess.\n\n* **@cosme TOKYO** - 5/5 (GF’s)\n\n &gt; Probably the largest beauty/cosmetics store in Japan, right near the entrance to [Takeshita Street](https://imgur.com/E0GxW2a) in Harajuku.  It’s known for their highlight their top product choices within each category.  Per the GF, “overstimulating, concentration of all the beauty things I want, felt like I was on top of people wherever I was.”  It probably didn’t help that we were visiting during the Japanese Labor Day weekend.\n\n* **[Shibuya Crossing/Scramble](https://imgur.com/PaLN3cj)** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Could be worthwhile to visit one of the cafes with windows that overlook it, but I found that I enjoy being part of the crowd.  Fairly easy to get to the front and among the first to cross the street.  When it’s time, some people are practically running to the center.\n\n* **MEGA Don Quijote Shibuya** - 4/5\n\n &gt; I was mainly there for the [KitKats](https://imgur.com/ZIL98iA), since I didn’t find too many exotic flavors elsewhere.  They had a better selection of flavors than the drugstores, but some were ¥100+ more expensive than at the drugstores.  Only they really had the ‘gift box’ style Kitkats at ¥900+.  Some of the flavors I got were: Shima lemon, blueberry cheesecake, sakura sake, , Tokyo Banana, Uji hojicha, and Uji matcha.  Last year, I picked up a whole bunch of cosmetics for the GF here.  Don Quijote is definitely best as a one-stop-shop for the convenience.  Tax-free is upstairs.  If spending over ¥10000, there’s at least an extra 5% off using this [coupon](https://www.taxfreeshops.jp/en/tieup/1).   At least it didn’t smell like sewage like the Shinjuku one I went to last year.  Some staff spoke Chinese.\n\n* **Hanazono Shrine** - 3/5\n\n &gt; The most important shrine in Shinjuku, popular among merchants and artists.  I wanted to check this out because they have an antique/flea market on Sundays, but apparently we went during the [morning of the Tori-no-Ichi Festival](https://imgur.com/y0TrNmc), so it was filled with food stalls and bamboo rake good luck charms.  Interesting to see a slice of Japan culture.\n\n* **Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Has two observation decks, one for each tower, which is a great free option to see the [endless expanse](https://imgur.com/0xYuGLD) that is Tokyo.  There are information panels pointing out famous landmarks.  Also has a cafe and souvenir shop.\n\n* **Brooming, Taito Station Shinjuku East Exit** - 4/5\n\n &gt; This is on the upper floors of the Taito Station game center.  It might sound crazy, but I wanted to get one of those Japanese photobooth photos with the GF.  It actually ended up being a unique experience with something to bring back as a memory of our trip.  ¥500 got us 4 poses, and each of us gets to decorate the same 4 photos to print out as a set of photo stickers.  Stickers were a little small, but not bad for ¥500, you can pay more for other options.  Our machine didn’t seem to allow for retakes, and it was rather fast in between shots.  You get a good amount of time to edit your photos.  The most hilarious part was during decoration/editing, you can choose various levels of ‘kawaii’-ness so your face gets super-airbrushed and you get gigantic eyes (we opted for the light effect).  Only girls or guy-girl couples allowed.  Lots of girls here getting photos.  There are also makeup areas and clothing rentals as well.  I’m definitely going to try for a photobooth experience every trip (whether it’s here or elsewhere).\n\n* **3D Cat Billboard** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Popular crowdstopper in Shinjuku.  Interesting 3D effect but there’s not much variation in what it does.  Could be more interesting if it’s a special event, e.g. Halloween or Christmas.\n\n* **Kabukicho** - 2/5\n\n &gt; Not much going on outside, there are some suggestive signs but otherwise kind of boring.  Definitely don’t make eye-contact with anyone standing in the middle of the street.  Just look past them and keep walking.\n\n* **Ginza Karen** - 2/5\n\n &gt; It’s okay if you want a suitcase to haul your stuff back from Japan.  But the pricing and quality didn’t quite make it worth it to buy to use as your ‘main’ luggage.  Plus you won’t be able to take advantage of any warranties.  Staff spoke Chinese.\n\n* **Senso-ji** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Tokyo’s oldest temple, with a decent-sized grounds.  The entrance starts with the Kaminarimon gate, which is quite grand and popular for photos.  After that, you walk down a market street with shops on both sides, before you reach the [inner Hozomon gate](https://imgur.com/YolBetd).  This temple is interesting because they have several stations set up for omikuji (paper fortunes), which you pay ¥100 to draw sticks from a metal box.  The stick has a number that corresponds to the box you should grab your paper fortune from.  Definitely a worthwhile experience.  Senso-ji is quite nice to visit at night (open 24/7), though the main hall closes at 5pm.\n\n* **KALDI COFFEE FARM Tokyo Solamachi** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Specialty coffee store that also carries a lot of international food, I remember seeing a lot from Europe.  I arrived 10 minutes after opening and they had already sold out of their [green garlic chili oil](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Caldi-KALDI-Garlic-Pepper-Dishes/dp/B0B4P2L7SG), which was somewhat viral and was recommended by a foodie friend.  Datapoint: they had 8 and limit 2 per person.  If you’re interested, I would recommend lining up before opening (they have multiple locations).\n\n* **212 KITCHEN STORE** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Also recommended by my foodie friend was the [Kikkoman Sakusaku crispy soy sauce almonds seasoning](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Almonds-Fermentation-Accompaniment-Kikkoman-Specialty/dp/B09J1G7KZK).  You use it like chili crunch (e.g. Lao Gan Ma).  They have a few other flavors like cashew lemon and truffle.  This store near Kaldi in Solamachi carried it.  LOFT also carries it.\n\n* **Gion Tsujirii** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Tea store founded in 1860 with its main store in Kyoto near Yasaka.  They have a cafe in Solamachi and sells matcha powder.  Didn’t seem as popular as Ippodo or Marukyu Koyamaen.\n\n* **Kappabashi Street** - 4/5\n\n &gt; The popular kitchenware street.  A good chunk of stores were closed, possibly due to it being Japanese Labor Day weekend.  Definitely a good spot to pick up souvenirs or practical kitchenware.  Lots of commercial kitchen stuff like pans, and even a store that sold only wooden menu stands.\n\n* **Dengama** - 3/5\n\n &gt; This is the store you’ll likely come across first, right at the start of the street (south end), and across from the giant chef’s head.  I went here last year and found some great ceramic pieces.  The store was quite packed this year, (anecdotally) though the ceramics were pricier and less interesting.  I previously bought a very nice matcha bowl upstairs (which has their higher-end stuff), but didn’t see anything as unique this time.\n\n* **Narita Airport** - 3/5\n\n &gt; A bit far from Tokyo.  They have an area that offers day rooms and showers.  Lots of shops selling souvenir snacks like Tokyo Banana, ROYCE, etc.  Personally, I liked Haneda much more as it’s much closer to Tokyo, has an interesting terminal floorplan, and has a small Don Quijote store, which is great for picking up last minute Japanese snacks and stuff for cheap (and spending the rest of your IC card money).\n\n# Tokyo Food\n\n* **Rokurinsha Tokyo Solamachi** - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.60\n\n &gt; I previously had this popular tsukemen at their Haneda Airport location, which was not overpriced given it was at an airport.  This was at Tokyo Skytree, at the 6th floor, which has all the restaurants (usually the top floors of the malls/department stores are dedicated to restaurants).  I ordered the extra large at ¥1600, which I thought would just be ‘large’ given our portion sizes in Texas, and holy crap that [bowl was massive](https://imgur.com/5kmDeyE).  I couldn’t finish it even though we didn’t really have a ‘lunch’ and we were eating at 10:00pm.  It felt terrible to let it all go to waste.  Outside of that, the tsukemen was excellent, the broth was nice and thick and the noodles were chewy.\n\n* **Tsumugi** - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.59\n\n &gt; My GF saw this on IG, which featured their signature [18-dish breakfast](https://imgur.com/XYn63kI) that is inspired by Shojin Ryori; one major difference is the presence of meat &amp; fish such as grilled duck, octopus, salmon roe, and fish cake.  For ¥2000, it was extremely tasty, with lots of variety.  It also comes with tea.  My favorites were the grilled duck, braised black beans, and tofu with yuzu paste.  Probably my favorite breakfast this trip.  It’s right on the grounds of Tsukiji Hongan Temple, and reservations are HIGHLY recommended; some people had to wait quite a while.\n\n* **Tricolore** - 5/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.75\n\n &gt; Per the GF: “vibes, long wait, 40ish minutes. Food is average. Coffee was good. Would recommend having a bar seat. be prepared for a longer wait if more than 4 people, not sure if they had bigger tables”\n\n* **Ginza Kimuraya** - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.60\n\n &gt; Oldest bakery in Tokyo and created anpan.  Went here last year but they had sold out of the [Ginza cream melon bread](https://imgur.com/tU0Cqo3).  This time I got it, excellent, much better than the konbini ones.  They also sell Hokkaido milk bread, which was also yums.\n\n* **Tendon Tenya Yaesu** - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.10\n\n &gt; I love tempura, so I had all the Tendon Tenya locations marked on my map in case we were nearby one for lunch/dinner.  We ended up here for dinner on our Ginza day.  No wait, but almost all seats were taken.  Lots of salarymen.  I [ordered quite a bit](https://imgur.com/3zCxY44).  My GF comments how the salaryman next to me gasped at how much food the server brought to me.  There’s a lot of vegetables and fish to choose from, it’s actually daunting how many different sets you can choose from.  They also have udon.  You order via ipad, and pay at the front.  Tempura was excellent, a little oily; yes it doesn’t compare to a fancy tempura place, but for something that’s quick, cheap, and delicious, you can’t beat the value (it probably tastes 80% as good, at a fraction of the cost, obviously ignoring the specialty ingredients).  I would love to open a Tendon Tenya back in the US.\n\n* **Hirosaku** - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.89 - Former Michelin 1 Star\n\n &gt; Found this rec on Reddit.  Ended up being an excellent choice.  Fairly small restaurant, 4 counter seats and a table.  Ikura chawanmushi, Hakasai Anago, maguro &amp; hirame sashimi, tempura (oyster, tamanegi onion, asparagus, Mukago yam), amadai &amp; rice, soba, and apricot monyaki.  The chef is quite old, but he and who I assume is his wife are a [cute pair in the kitchen](https://imgur.com/rbbk0RP).  One of the diners was his friend of 30 years, who received a special menu that included grilled beef.  Excellent value for a full course meal, and at only ¥6000.  Reservations highly recommended (possibly necessary?), reservation by phone only.  I used Visa Concierge to book this, which was free and easy.\n\n* **MARLOWE Ginza Six** - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.25\n\n &gt; Pudding brand in the high-end department store basement.  Pudding was quite possibly TOO rich/sweet.  The pudding cup is a glass beaker that’s actually useful, and a fun souvenir to bring back as a reminder.\n\n* **Ramen Sukoyaka** - 5/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.78\n\n &gt; Their specialty is a [broth made of clam and chicken](https://imgur.com/Ptd1aRC).  Per the GF, “deep but light broth, chicken was good, no dirt that is often associated with clams”.  Also recognized as a Tabelog 100 Ramen in Tokyo for several years in a row.  It’s a bit out of the way, but worth going to if you’re in the area for Ghibli Museum/Kichijoji.  Order via vending machine.\n\n* **Gochisou Yakimusubi Onimaru Kichijoji** - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.06\n\n &gt; Popular shop with a variety of onigiri for sale.  Decent size, and pricing was quite fair.  Recommend checking out earlier in the day as a couple of flavors were already sold out, also likely to be more freshly made.\n\n* **GLITCH COFFEE &amp; ROASTERS** - 4/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.65\n\n &gt; Walkable from the Tokyo Imperial Palace.  This is their flagship store, stocking only [single-origin beans](https://imgur.com/fBPboiq).  The lines can get long (the Ginza one was crazy long).  Per the GF, “it’s expensive, but you learn a lot.  Everything is light roast.  The staff’s English was very good, and all 3 guys were very cute”\n\n* **Syabu-Yō atre Akihabara 2** - 4/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.06\n\n &gt; The GF was craving shabu shabu, so Shabu-Yo (not sure why this location’s name is ‘Syabu’ on Google) seemed like a reputable chain.  We ate with her friend who lived in Japan, who also likes this chain.  The wait was at least an hour, even after 1pm.  There are [lots of meat tiers](https://imgur.com/J6M0SpG), which have more types at the higher price point.  The tier that included wagyu was ¥2899+tax for lunch, so we settled on that.  My GF really liked their curry, and there were a lot of desserts you won’t see in American shabu places.  The biggest downside was the meh vegetable options.\n\n* **[I’m donut? Harajuku](https://imgur.com/G9bDZn5)** - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.55\n\n &gt; Popular donut spot I went to last year, albeit too late in the day, so there were barely any left.  This time I lined up right as they were opening as it’s just across the street from the main Torii to Meiji Jingu.  The line is a bit long, but they’re pretty efficient.  [Flavors include matcha, pistachio, anko cream, cacao, and strawberry chocolate raw french cruller](https://imgur.com/HCJWLAG).  Prices range from ¥220 to ¥480.  It was as good as I remember it, mochi-like, and not oily like American donuts.  They’re known for using a kabocha-based dough, while unique, I much prefer the wheat ones.  Only a 20 min wait at 10am.  Worth the wait if your plans can fit in a detour!\n\n* **Hakata Gekijo Shibuya Miyamasuzaka** - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.03\n\n &gt; Izakaya that the GF’s college friend who lives in Japan recommended.  It was quite lively as many tables were filled with people who were out for food/drinks after work.  Per the GF, “service was slow, food wasn’t too impressive, and drinks didn’t seem too strong; would have to go with someone who speaks Japanese”.  Reservations are recommended.\n\n* **Dogenzaka Church / The Church** - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.11\n\n &gt; Interesting bar that looks like a church outside and inside.  Downstairs you [sit in pews](https://imgur.com/bhtHYMB) (dark aside from the candles), and upstairs (separate charge) is a cabaret-like lounge that’s good for casual conversation, and if you want to see people’s faces.  Drinks were not outrageously priced.\n\n* **Cois Espresso Club** - 3/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.49\n\n &gt; Per the GF, “more aesthetic than flavor, small coffee size, no restroom”.\n\n* **Himawari Sushi Shintoshi** - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.43\n\n &gt; Might be our favorite meal of the trip.  Local conveyor belt sushi shop.  The conveyor belt has a good amount of sushi on it, but you can call out to the [chefs in the middle](https://imgur.com/8tClzzW) for specific pieces.  The plate colors denote the price, ranging from ¥150 to ¥600.  For reference. one piece of o-toro (fatty tuna) was ¥300, uni was ¥600.  Their [menu was super helpful](https://imgur.com/4yYukfF), with prices, pictures, and English and Japanese names.  Can also order soup and desserts.  My favorite thing?  Two pieces of smoked duck for ¥150 (yes, I know, at a sushi shop, sue me.  But damned if this wasn’t the most delicious thing); I ordered 4 plates of these.  The GF, being a bigger seafood-lover, thoroughly enjoyed it.  My only criticism is they didn’t have the clam soup or almond pudding.  If there is one singular food recommendation from this whole report, it’s Himawari Sushi Shintoshi!\n\n* **Minami Aoyama Sokkon** - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.06\n\n &gt; Dinner with a Japanese classmate from grad school.  What’s special about this restaurant is that they have a [candlelit room](https://imgur.com/Hl5LKNj) that is used for traditional tea ceremonies.  And as my friend is practicing under the Urasenke school, he performed a tea ceremony before dinner, quite a memorable experience for us.  Dinner was kaiseki.  I believe there is a special course that comes with tea pairings (which we didn’t get).  The meal was good but perhaps a bit pricey for what you get.\n\n* **Hatoya Asakusa** - 3/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.48\n\n &gt; Viral matcha latte shop in the Asakusa area.  Somewhat long line, it takes a while because each drink is [handwhisked](https://imgur.com/yNgipaB) in front of you (several folks took videos of this process)  Per the GF, “milk is different from that of other matcha latte places.  You have to add syrup because compared to other places, the matcha was not as sweet, mochi and ice cream didn't add anything to the enjoyment of the latte.”\n\n* **Tendon Tenya Asakusa** - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.07\n\n &gt; Our final sit-down meal in Japan, and fitting as it’s my comfort food.  This Tendon Tenya branch was on the way to Kappabashi Street.  Like the other location, I ordered a lot, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  One mistake I made was I had ordered off their to-go section, so watch out for that.\n\n[All 72 photos compiled here](https://imgur.com/a/japan-november-2025-qmPI5RH)\n\nThanks for reading all this, and I wish you the best on your next Japan trip (and the associated planning)!",

Pretty long line of 30+ people.  It seemed orderly, but some folks took a while to take their photo with it. Also, the line will take longer than it looks because people would rent a pedal boat and go right up to the shrine from the other side (the water), and take a photo with it.  Seems like a devious shortcut.  We didn’t need the ‘perfect shot’ so we just stood at the stairs area and took a selfie with it in the background.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hakone Shrine&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A few sets of stairs from the Peace Torii, this shrine was popular among samurai.  Check it out if you’re already here for the Peace Torii.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hakone sightseeing cruise&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Basically comes with the Hakone Freepass; take it if you intend on doing the loop.  Nothing too special about it, I would try to get to the exit as the ship approaches land, because you’ll be ‘competing’ with everyone else to get to the ropeway (assuming you decided to loop clockwise).  There’s a first class ticket you can get, seems like you get a special seating area and enter via a separate line. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hakone Ropeway&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also part of the Hakone Freepass and the loop.  The line is quite long but moves at a steady pace as people fill in the gondolas.  Excellent view of the area, unfortunately it was not clear enough to see Mt. Fuji that day.  Seeing the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/BMFumdu\"&gt;vents/fumes from Owakudani&lt;/a&gt; from the gondolas was pretty neat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owakudani&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The area itself was fairly cold given how high up we were.  It was cool to see the vents/fumes a little closer.  Would’ve been cool to do the trail tour to see things even more up-close, but it seemed to be open to Japanese-speakers in order to follow instructions in the case of an emergency.  I tried to still book it with a friend’s address but the GF didn’t feel comfortable with it, so we had to pass on it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Owakudani Kurotamagokan&lt;/strong&gt; - 3.5/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Gift shop with lots of regional food, as well as black egg-themed souvenirs such as Sanrio characters, socks, shirts, you name it.  There was a line wrapping around the perimeter of the store to buy the eggs boiled in sulfurous water.  The eggs were black, almost like a smooth, egg-shaped pumice stone; however, it looked like regular eggs once de-shelled, and tasted the same as well.  I would only get it for the novelty.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gokuraku Tea Shop&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Checked it out since we passed by it.  Had souvenirs, modern and more traditional, including the distinctive Hakone wood mosaics (yosegi), comprised of geometric patterns.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sounzan Station, and the bus back to Hakone-Yumoto Station&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is where things went awry on our trip.  To get back to Hakone-Yumoto Station, Google Maps said the fastest way was to take a bus from the stop a walk away from Sounzan Station.  The bus ended up being really late, an hour if I recall.  Also, it wasn’t covered by the Hakone Freepass, and the bus driver angrily (almost vehemently) told us this (in Japanese).  Despite showing I was willing to use my ICOCA to pay the fare, he gestured to us to take the cable car to Gora.  After he drove off, another bus pulled up (likely the next one, but due to traffic, ended up being 1 min apart rather than 30 minutes) and we got into this one via ICOCA fare.  Anyways, TERRIBLE traffic all the way back to Hakone-Yumoto, I’d estimate an hour once we were on the bus.  My advice regarding this is, once you’re done with the loop and you’ve seen &amp;amp; done what you wanted, try to get to Hakone-Yumoto ASAP, the traffic seems to get worse as people start to leave the area for the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Hakone Food&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gyokutei&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ryokan we stayed at in Hakone came with dinner and breakfast.  Dinner was a traditional kaiseki, which came with shirako (fish sperm sac).  I couldn’t quite stomach it, but the rest of the dinners were quite tasty, very seafood-focused: scallop, oysterball, uni, tuna, amberjack, seabream, tofu, wagyu, taro, miso soup.  Breakfast was a &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/yF7EqCx\"&gt;traditional breakfast&lt;/a&gt; with a grilled whole horse mackerel, fish sausage, tamago, among other sides.  Very excellent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hakone Cheese Terrace&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.49&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Per the GF, not too sweet, the right amount of creaminess but without feeling gross, which is a worry when going to Asian (cheese)cake places. basic is good, would want to try the other flavors next time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tokyo Activities&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/hmN9a5x\"&gt;Tsukiji Outer Market&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 2/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We walked by after breakfast to Tsumugi.  A good amount of tourists at 9:30am, some shops weren’t open.  Similar to Nishiki or Kuromon Market, lots of wagyu on a stick and other tourist trap-ish food are available.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ippodo Tea Ginza Mitsukoshi&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the department store basement locations.  The original is based in Kyoto (which I recommend going!); the brand is considered a purveyor of matcha to the imperial family.  Limit on matcha in place.  Got the fall seasonal matcha, and some hojicha.  There are at least 4 in the central Tokyo area, all department store basements.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Itoya&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4 stars for the casual, 5 for those into stationary as this is stationary heaven.  There’s a whole floor dedicated to fountain pens.  Other stuff include non-fountain pens, journals, paper, greeting cards, stickers, pretty much anything around stationary.  Staff are knowledgeable.  Most of the floors are pretty packed, so be prepared to ‘shuffle’ a little.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ginza LOFT&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;LOFT is a chain store that’s kind of like a mix of Target and Muji, with a good amount of stationary and beauty products.  A little lifestyle-ish.  Definitely check it out, I dare you to walk out without buying less than ¥5000.  They have a tax-free counter as well!  Bought a whole bunch of candy, matcha supplies, and Apagard toothpaste.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hands&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Similar to LOFT, it’s a chain that has a variety of things.  It felt a little like a more upscale Daiso, with home improvement, kitchen, and craft supplies.  Definitely doesn’t feel ‘lifestyle’ like LOFT did.  We ended up not buying anything here (though going to LOFT first probably didn’t help).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wpc.&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Umbrella store.  It’s a popular Japanese brand, I saw it all over the LOFTs and Hands.  They have a lot of lightweight ones.  I was looking for their UV0 line, which was not in stock at LOFT/Hands due to it being a summer item.  I found it at the Wpc. flagship store.  They have several with designs like Pokemon and art.  Difficult to find, look very closely at the map, it’s underground.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/7nWiBVd\"&gt;”Your Name” Stairs&lt;/a&gt; (Suga Shrine Otokodan) / Suga Shrine&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit out of the way, but if you want to see the stairs that were featured at the end of the movie Your Name, it’s this one.  There were a few folks here, but people weren’t hogging it, you take turns to grab your photo.  The shrine just across the little parking lot, it makes sense why it was chosen for the movie as it’s said to &lt;span class=\"md-spoiler-text\"&gt;protect against natural disasters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/INm4j3F\"&gt;Meiji Jingu Gaien Ginkgo Avenue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 4.5/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;25 min walk from Suga Shrine.  Almost magical to see during the fall.  The street is lined up with gingko trees, with some &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/1idt3vN\"&gt;variation in the colors&lt;/a&gt;.  If there’s a gust of wind, you can see the leaves falling.  This also meant it was had lots of people about, not shoulder-to-shoulder, but you won’t be able to get a people-less photo (if that matters to you).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoyeido&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 (GF’s)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Incense brand established in 1705 by a Kyoto Imperial Palace staff member.  Well-known brand with a shop in Ginza.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancora&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 (GF’s)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Per the GF, “lots of customizations, and Ancora-specific inks, great gifts for stationary lovers, expensive, be prepared to spend a lot”.  Ancora is Sailor’s flagship store, and has two special inks for sale, one only on a day with a full moon, and one during rainy days.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghibli Museum&lt;/strong&gt; - 2/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The famous Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, near Kichijoji.  We went here blind, so we didn’t know what exhibits were here or anything.  The ‘beginning of movement’ room was quite interesting and thought-provoking (explaining how animation came about), I really enjoyed it.  Outside of that, I was quite let down.  I expected more ‘learning’ given ‘Museum’ was in its name.  There wasn’t too much to see, exhibits-wise, though I’m sure some of it had to do with the fact that the special exhibits room and book room were dedicated to Yuriko Yamawaki, a children’s book illustrator who seemed to have no direct connection to Studio Ghibli, and the featured short film wasn’t in the Studio Ghibli style I grew up watching (e.g. animation of a popular children’s book).  The room with Hayao’s ‘workshop’ and sketchbooks were interesting, but didn’t have any labels/signs/panels to explain things.  Personally, it feels a bit ‘incomplete’.  I think the only areas in the whole museum that had information about what we were seeing were 1) the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/UvvwytS\"&gt;‘beginning of movement’&lt;/a&gt; room, and 2) a big one explaining the book illustrator’s biography.  In my opinion, unless you are a Studio Ghibli fan, I would skip this or at least deprioritize it, especially considering the hurdles (difficult to reserve, and somewhat out of the way).  Fortunately, the tickets were quite cheap.  I do think the spirit of the museum is captured in Hayao’s &lt;a href=\"https://www.ghibli-museum.jp/en/kind/\"&gt;thoughts here&lt;/a&gt;, but I also think there’s only so much you can glean from just ‘looking’ (just my two cents).  My &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1o32eo0/ghibli_museum_nov_2025_reservation_experience_tips/\"&gt;reservation experience and tips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOOKOFF Kichijoji-eki-kitaguchi Store&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Last year, I didn’t have great success finding the volume 1’s of the popular manga (Jujutsu Kaisen and Demon Slayer, mainly) at the BOOKOFFs, but eventually found it at the Kichijoji BOOKOFF.  And like last year, I couldn’t find Dandadan and Kagurabachi until once again, Kichijoji’s.  Take that for what you will.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kitanomaru Park&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A nice park area near the Tokyo Imperial Palace, it has a great maple grove called &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/RmpHgCI\"&gt;Momiji-bayashi&lt;/a&gt;, which is perfect to see the autumn foliage.  Lots of open space for a picnic.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOBICHI Tokyo&lt;/strong&gt; - 3.5/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Basically down the street from GLITCH COFFEE, this is Hobonichi’s Tokyo store.  It’s much easier to get to compared to Kyoto’s, and maybe double in size in terms of offerings.  The Junji Ito collab were sold out.  A must for Hobonichi/stationary fans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CARD WINGS&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A card shop I randomly browsed in Akihabara.  The Pokemon stuff were expensive like Osaka’s, but the Union Arena cards they had on display caught my eye.  They feature IP like Bleach, Jujutsu Kaisen, and Demon Slayer, so I picked some cheap ones (not sure if these were overpriced like Pokemon).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/LyON6nK\"&gt;Tokyo National Museum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Super impressive museum.  Showcases a lot of the cultural aspects of Japan, particularly around art.  Good amount of objects related to Buddhism.  Excellent collection of lacquer, and samurai-related objects.  My favorite part is the amount of information displayed on the wall when entering each room, and a good amount of objects had a description, purpose, etc.  You would need at least half a day just to go through it, and we didn’t even get a chance to go through the Heisekan and Toyokan galleries.  Kids might be bored here, but I think this would be great for an inquisitive middle/high schooler.  Tickets were only ¥1000, and appear to be free for anyone under 18.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meiji Jingu&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A Shinto shrine in the middle of a forest in the middle of Tokyo, which is impressive.  There was a wedding ceremony in procession (didn’t even know you could book Meiji Jingu of all places).  More interestingly, we came the day before the Niiname-sai (harvest festival), so there were &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/3bZNcUa\"&gt;crops&lt;/a&gt; and food lined up all along the wall, donated by farmers, businesses, and even a 5th grade class from an elementary school.  The grounds are quite large, and there’s a few things to see like the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/l3i3K1K\"&gt;wall of sake barrels&lt;/a&gt;, the Camphor Tree ‘couple’, &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/FmIVFZf\"&gt;Torii gate&lt;/a&gt;, the garden, and a museum.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tokyo Christmas Market in Meiji Jingu&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There is an entry fee, but if you book online in advance, you get a mug.  Just a Christmas market in a park area.  The outside perimeter is comprised of food stalls, and the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/fefJoUp\"&gt;inner stalls have merchandise&lt;/a&gt;.  Everything did seem to be Christmas-oriented and mostly appear to be handmade.  There is a Christmas pyramid to take photos with.  There’s a stage with some random dancer/singers.  Good for kids I guess.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@cosme TOKYO&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 (GF’s)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Probably the largest beauty/cosmetics store in Japan, right near the entrance to &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/E0GxW2a\"&gt;Takeshita Street&lt;/a&gt; in Harajuku.  It’s known for their highlight their top product choices within each category.  Per the GF, “overstimulating, concentration of all the beauty things I want, felt like I was on top of people wherever I was.”  It probably didn’t help that we were visiting during the Japanese Labor Day weekend.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/PaLN3cj\"&gt;Shibuya Crossing/Scramble&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Could be worthwhile to visit one of the cafes with windows that overlook it, but I found that I enjoy being part of the crowd.  Fairly easy to get to the front and among the first to cross the street.  When it’s time, some people are practically running to the center.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MEGA Don Quijote Shibuya&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I was mainly there for the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/ZIL98iA\"&gt;KitKats&lt;/a&gt;, since I didn’t find too many exotic flavors elsewhere.  They had a better selection of flavors than the drugstores, but some were ¥100+ more expensive than at the drugstores.  Only they really had the ‘gift box’ style Kitkats at ¥900+.  Some of the flavors I got were: Shima lemon, blueberry cheesecake, sakura sake, , Tokyo Banana, Uji hojicha, and Uji matcha.  Last year, I picked up a whole bunch of cosmetics for the GF here.  Don Quijote is definitely best as a one-stop-shop for the convenience.  Tax-free is upstairs.  If spending over ¥10000, there’s at least an extra 5% off using this &lt;a href=\"https://www.taxfreeshops.jp/en/tieup/1\"&gt;coupon&lt;/a&gt;.   At least it didn’t smell like sewage like the Shinjuku one I went to last year.  Some staff spoke Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanazono Shrine&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The most important shrine in Shinjuku, popular among merchants and artists.  I wanted to check this out because they have an antique/flea market on Sundays, but apparently we went during the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/y0TrNmc\"&gt;morning of the Tori-no-Ichi Festival&lt;/a&gt;, so it was filled with food stalls and bamboo rake good luck charms.  Interesting to see a slice of Japan culture.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Has two observation decks, one for each tower, which is a great free option to see the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/0xYuGLD\"&gt;endless expanse&lt;/a&gt; that is Tokyo.  There are information panels pointing out famous landmarks.  Also has a cafe and souvenir shop.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooming, Taito Station Shinjuku East Exit&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is on the upper floors of the Taito Station game center.  It might sound crazy, but I wanted to get one of those Japanese photobooth photos with the GF.  It actually ended up being a unique experience with something to bring back as a memory of our trip.  ¥500 got us 4 poses, and each of us gets to decorate the same 4 photos to print out as a set of photo stickers.  Stickers were a little small, but not bad for ¥500, you can pay more for other options.  Our machine didn’t seem to allow for retakes, and it was rather fast in between shots.  You get a good amount of time to edit your photos.  The most hilarious part was during decoration/editing, you can choose various levels of ‘kawaii’-ness so your face gets super-airbrushed and you get gigantic eyes (we opted for the light effect).  Only girls or guy-girl couples allowed.  Lots of girls here getting photos.  There are also makeup areas and clothing rentals as well.  I’m definitely going to try for a photobooth experience every trip (whether it’s here or elsewhere).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3D Cat Billboard&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Popular crowdstopper in Shinjuku.  Interesting 3D effect but there’s not much variation in what it does.  Could be more interesting if it’s a special event, e.g. Halloween or Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kabukicho&lt;/strong&gt; - 2/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not much going on outside, there are some suggestive signs but otherwise kind of boring.  Definitely don’t make eye-contact with anyone standing in the middle of the street.  Just look past them and keep walking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ginza Karen&lt;/strong&gt; - 2/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s okay if you want a suitcase to haul your stuff back from Japan.  But the pricing and quality didn’t quite make it worth it to buy to use as your ‘main’ luggage.  Plus you won’t be able to take advantage of any warranties.  Staff spoke Chinese.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senso-ji&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tokyo’s oldest temple, with a decent-sized grounds.  The entrance starts with the Kaminarimon gate, which is quite grand and popular for photos.  After that, you walk down a market street with shops on both sides, before you reach the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/YolBetd\"&gt;inner Hozomon gate&lt;/a&gt;.  This temple is interesting because they have several stations set up for omikuji (paper fortunes), which you pay ¥100 to draw sticks from a metal box.  The stick has a number that corresponds to the box you should grab your paper fortune from.  Definitely a worthwhile experience.  Senso-ji is quite nice to visit at night (open 24/7), though the main hall closes at 5pm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KALDI COFFEE FARM Tokyo Solamachi&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Specialty coffee store that also carries a lot of international food, I remember seeing a lot from Europe.  I arrived 10 minutes after opening and they had already sold out of their &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Caldi-KALDI-Garlic-Pepper-Dishes/dp/B0B4P2L7SG\"&gt;green garlic chili oil&lt;/a&gt;, which was somewhat viral and was recommended by a foodie friend.  Datapoint: they had 8 and limit 2 per person.  If you’re interested, I would recommend lining up before opening (they have multiple locations).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;212 KITCHEN STORE&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also recommended by my foodie friend was the &lt;a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Almonds-Fermentation-Accompaniment-Kikkoman-Specialty/dp/B09J1G7KZK\"&gt;Kikkoman Sakusaku crispy soy sauce almonds seasoning&lt;/a&gt;.  You use it like chili crunch (e.g. Lao Gan Ma).  They have a few other flavors like cashew lemon and truffle.  This store near Kaldi in Solamachi carried it.  LOFT also carries it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gion Tsujirii&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tea store founded in 1860 with its main store in Kyoto near Yasaka.  They have a cafe in Solamachi and sells matcha powder.  Didn’t seem as popular as Ippodo or Marukyu Koyamaen.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kappabashi Street&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The popular kitchenware street.  A good chunk of stores were closed, possibly due to it being Japanese Labor Day weekend.  Definitely a good spot to pick up souvenirs or practical kitchenware.  Lots of commercial kitchen stuff like pans, and even a store that sold only wooden menu stands.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dengama&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is the store you’ll likely come across first, right at the start of the street (south end), and across from the giant chef’s head.  I went here last year and found some great ceramic pieces.  The store was quite packed this year, (anecdotally) though the ceramics were pricier and less interesting.  I previously bought a very nice matcha bowl upstairs (which has their higher-end stuff), but didn’t see anything as unique this time.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Narita Airport&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A bit far from Tokyo.  They have an area that offers day rooms and showers.  Lots of shops selling souvenir snacks like Tokyo Banana, ROYCE, etc.  Personally, I liked Haneda much more as it’s much closer to Tokyo, has an interesting terminal floorplan, and has a small Don Quijote store, which is great for picking up last minute Japanese snacks and stuff for cheap (and spending the rest of your IC card money).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tokyo Food&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rokurinsha Tokyo Solamachi&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.60&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I previously had this popular tsukemen at their Haneda Airport location, which was not overpriced given it was at an airport.  This was at Tokyo Skytree, at the 6th floor, which has all the restaurants (usually the top floors of the malls/department stores are dedicated to restaurants).  I ordered the extra large at ¥1600, which I thought would just be ‘large’ given our portion sizes in Texas, and holy crap that &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/5kmDeyE\"&gt;bowl was massive&lt;/a&gt;.  I couldn’t finish it even though we didn’t really have a ‘lunch’ and we were eating at 10:00pm.  It felt terrible to let it all go to waste.  Outside of that, the tsukemen was excellent, the broth was nice and thick and the noodles were chewy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tsumugi&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.59&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;My GF saw this on IG, which featured their signature &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/XYn63kI\"&gt;18-dish breakfast&lt;/a&gt; that is inspired by Shojin Ryori; one major difference is the presence of meat &amp;amp; fish such as grilled duck, octopus, salmon roe, and fish cake.  For ¥2000, it was extremely tasty, with lots of variety.  It also comes with tea.  My favorites were the grilled duck, braised black beans, and tofu with yuzu paste.  Probably my favorite breakfast this trip.  It’s right on the grounds of Tsukiji Hongan Temple, and reservations are HIGHLY recommended; some people had to wait quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tricolore&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.75&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Per the GF: “vibes, long wait, 40ish minutes. Food is average. Coffee was good. Would recommend having a bar seat. be prepared for a longer wait if more than 4 people, not sure if they had bigger tables”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ginza Kimuraya&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.60&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Oldest bakery in Tokyo and created anpan.  Went here last year but they had sold out of the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/tU0Cqo3\"&gt;Ginza cream melon bread&lt;/a&gt;.  This time I got it, excellent, much better than the konbini ones.  They also sell Hokkaido milk bread, which was also yums.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tendon Tenya Yaesu&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.10&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I love tempura, so I had all the Tendon Tenya locations marked on my map in case we were nearby one for lunch/dinner.  We ended up here for dinner on our Ginza day.  No wait, but almost all seats were taken.  Lots of salarymen.  I &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/3zCxY44\"&gt;ordered quite a bit&lt;/a&gt;.  My GF comments how the salaryman next to me gasped at how much food the server brought to me.  There’s a lot of vegetables and fish to choose from, it’s actually daunting how many different sets you can choose from.  They also have udon.  You order via ipad, and pay at the front.  Tempura was excellent, a little oily; yes it doesn’t compare to a fancy tempura place, but for something that’s quick, cheap, and delicious, you can’t beat the value (it probably tastes 80% as good, at a fraction of the cost, obviously ignoring the specialty ingredients).  I would love to open a Tendon Tenya back in the US.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hirosaku&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.89 - Former Michelin 1 Star&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Found this rec on Reddit.  Ended up being an excellent choice.  Fairly small restaurant, 4 counter seats and a table.  Ikura chawanmushi, Hakasai Anago, maguro &amp;amp; hirame sashimi, tempura (oyster, tamanegi onion, asparagus, Mukago yam), amadai &amp;amp; rice, soba, and apricot monyaki.  The chef is quite old, but he and who I assume is his wife are a &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/rbbk0RP\"&gt;cute pair in the kitchen&lt;/a&gt;.  One of the diners was his friend of 30 years, who received a special menu that included grilled beef.  Excellent value for a full course meal, and at only ¥6000.  Reservations highly recommended (possibly necessary?), reservation by phone only.  I used Visa Concierge to book this, which was free and easy.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARLOWE Ginza Six&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.25&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pudding brand in the high-end department store basement.  Pudding was quite possibly TOO rich/sweet.  The pudding cup is a glass beaker that’s actually useful, and a fun souvenir to bring back as a reminder.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ramen Sukoyaka&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.78&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Their specialty is a &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/Ptd1aRC\"&gt;broth made of clam and chicken&lt;/a&gt;.  Per the GF, “deep but light broth, chicken was good, no dirt that is often associated with clams”.  Also recognized as a Tabelog 100 Ramen in Tokyo for several years in a row.  It’s a bit out of the way, but worth going to if you’re in the area for Ghibli Museum/Kichijoji.  Order via vending machine.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gochisou Yakimusubi Onimaru Kichijoji&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.06&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Popular shop with a variety of onigiri for sale.  Decent size, and pricing was quite fair.  Recommend checking out earlier in the day as a couple of flavors were already sold out, also likely to be more freshly made.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GLITCH COFFEE &amp;amp; ROASTERS&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.65&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Walkable from the Tokyo Imperial Palace.  This is their flagship store, stocking only &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/fBPboiq\"&gt;single-origin beans&lt;/a&gt;.  The lines can get long (the Ginza one was crazy long).  Per the GF, “it’s expensive, but you learn a lot.  Everything is light roast.  The staff’s English was very good, and all 3 guys were very cute”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syabu-Yō atre Akihabara 2&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.06&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The GF was craving shabu shabu, so Shabu-Yo (not sure why this location’s name is ‘Syabu’ on Google) seemed like a reputable chain.  We ate with her friend who lived in Japan, who also likes this chain.  The wait was at least an hour, even after 1pm.  There are &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/J6M0SpG\"&gt;lots of meat tiers&lt;/a&gt;, which have more types at the higher price point.  The tier that included wagyu was ¥2899+tax for lunch, so we settled on that.  My GF really liked their curry, and there were a lot of desserts you won’t see in American shabu places.  The biggest downside was the meh vegetable options.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/G9bDZn5\"&gt;I’m donut? Harajuku&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.55&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Popular donut spot I went to last year, albeit too late in the day, so there were barely any left.  This time I lined up right as they were opening as it’s just across the street from the main Torii to Meiji Jingu.  The line is a bit long, but they’re pretty efficient.  &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/HCJWLAG\"&gt;Flavors include matcha, pistachio, anko cream, cacao, and strawberry chocolate raw french cruller&lt;/a&gt;.  Prices range from ¥220 to ¥480.  It was as good as I remember it, mochi-like, and not oily like American donuts.  They’re known for using a kabocha-based dough, while unique, I much prefer the wheat ones.  Only a 20 min wait at 10am.  Worth the wait if your plans can fit in a detour!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hakata Gekijo Shibuya Miyamasuzaka&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.03&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Izakaya that the GF’s college friend who lives in Japan recommended.  It was quite lively as many tables were filled with people who were out for food/drinks after work.  Per the GF, “service was slow, food wasn’t too impressive, and drinks didn’t seem too strong; would have to go with someone who speaks Japanese”.  Reservations are recommended.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dogenzaka Church / The Church&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.11&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Interesting bar that looks like a church outside and inside.  Downstairs you &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/bhtHYMB\"&gt;sit in pews&lt;/a&gt; (dark aside from the candles), and upstairs (separate charge) is a cabaret-like lounge that’s good for casual conversation, and if you want to see people’s faces.  Drinks were not outrageously priced.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cois Espresso Club&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.49&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Per the GF, “more aesthetic than flavor, small coffee size, no restroom”.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Himawari Sushi Shintoshi&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.43&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Might be our favorite meal of the trip.  Local conveyor belt sushi shop.  The conveyor belt has a good amount of sushi on it, but you can call out to the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/8tClzzW\"&gt;chefs in the middle&lt;/a&gt; for specific pieces.  The plate colors denote the price, ranging from ¥150 to ¥600.  For reference. one piece of o-toro (fatty tuna) was ¥300, uni was ¥600.  Their &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/4yYukfF\"&gt;menu was super helpful&lt;/a&gt;, with prices, pictures, and English and Japanese names.  Can also order soup and desserts.  My favorite thing?  Two pieces of smoked duck for ¥150 (yes, I know, at a sushi shop, sue me.  But damned if this wasn’t the most delicious thing); I ordered 4 plates of these.  The GF, being a bigger seafood-lover, thoroughly enjoyed it.  My only criticism is they didn’t have the clam soup or almond pudding.  If there is one singular food recommendation from this whole report, it’s Himawari Sushi Shintoshi!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minami Aoyama Sokkon&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.06&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Dinner with a Japanese classmate from grad school.  What’s special about this restaurant is that they have a &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/Hl5LKNj\"&gt;candlelit room&lt;/a&gt; that is used for traditional tea ceremonies.  And as my friend is practicing under the Urasenke school, he performed a tea ceremony before dinner, quite a memorable experience for us.  Dinner was kaiseki.  I believe there is a special course that comes with tea pairings (which we didn’t get).  The meal was good but perhaps a bit pricey for what you get.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hatoya Asakusa&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.48&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Viral matcha latte shop in the Asakusa area.  Somewhat long line, it takes a while because each drink is &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/yNgipaB\"&gt;handwhisked&lt;/a&gt; in front of you (several folks took videos of this process)  Per the GF, “milk is different from that of other matcha latte places.  You have to add syrup because compared to other places, the matcha was not as sweet, mochi and ice cream didn&amp;#39;t add anything to the enjoyment of the latte.”&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tendon Tenya Asakusa&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.07&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our final sit-down meal in Japan, and fitting as it’s my comfort food.  This Tendon Tenya branch was on the way to Kappabashi Street.  Like the other location, I ordered a lot, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  One mistake I made was I had ordered off their to-go section, so watch out for that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/japan-november-2025-qmPI5RH\"&gt;All 72 photos compiled here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading all this, and I wish you the best on your next Japan trip (and the associated planning)!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "My girlfriend (now fiance) and I just came back from Japan last week. This trip report is to 1) journal our experience and 2) and share that experience with others so their future trips to Japan can be more amazing. Happy to answer questions!\n\nMy first report was for my [first trip back in March 2024](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1c23f7d/march_2024_2week_solo_trip_report_osaka_kyoto_uji/).  This time, I have my tips first followed by our detailed trip report, and with better formatting inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ermgvc/trip_report_nov_dec_2023_tokyo_kyoto_osaka/)\n\n# Tips and recommendations\n* Hotels\n * Booking.com seemed to have the best availability and pricing compared to Expedia and Airbnb.  I also took advantage of using Rakuten’s link during the ‘travel week’ promo, getting 8% cashback, though the cashback seems to take a while…\n * Other than Tokyo, many accommodations had free cancellation up to the month before or even up to 3 days before.  This is helpful if you want to remain flexible, e.g. check for new/cheaper availabilities.\n * Booking.com also had the ‘private bathroom’ filter which my girlfriend was adamant on.\n * I recommend checking as early as you can.  If something looks good and has free cancellation, book that and keep shopping around.\n * I checked roughly every 2 weeks leading up to our trip. Around the 1.5 month mark, the availability of places that fit our criteria significantly dropped.  Another interpretation: the price for similar places/locations were at least 20% more expensive.  My guess is the sweet spot is 3-4 months before.  Your mileage may vary!\n* Shopping\n * If you know Chinese and you are shopping at touristy spots, many staff are/speak Chinese.  We encountered it quite frequently at drug stores, the Reddit-popular suitcase store Ginza Karen, and Don Quijote.\n* Food\n * If there is one singular food recommendation from this whole report, it’s Himawari Sushi Shintoshi!  Affordable and good conveyor belt sushi.  Read about it in the Tokyo Food section.\n * Don’t sleep on the chain restaurants.  Personally, I really enjoy Tendon Tenya for tempura.\n * Tabelog is a fairly reliable rating website for food in Japan, just know that their algorithm works differently.  It seems like businesses start at a 3, then move up based on the ratings of power users, who have the most impact.\n * If you need more fiber in your diet (likely so), most konbini have ‘Fibre Mini’ drinks or the ‘in’ peach/grape jelly packs.  The jelly is good but slightly difficult to slurp.  If you want to be more economical, I would recommend buying the sticks of powdered fiber (dextrin) at a drugstore.\n* Trains\n * Some tips for getting to/on the right train, do the following checks:\n     * Are you at the right numbered platform?\n     * Is the train color/letter correct, either on hanging signage or the train digital sign?\n     * Does the time match what's on Google Maps? Some trains share the same platform, or you might need a Local, Express, etc.\n     * See if signage at the platform mention the next stop, does that match the next stop on Google Maps? Signage to look for include signs, pillars, and walls, like the walk across the platform if underground.\n * Try to exit from the correct gate, this will save time waiting at lights outside or dealing with the weather. If a station is big enough, it may take 15-20 minutes just to get back on track from exiting the wrong gate.\n * If you have time waiting for the train, for many trains, Google Maps will list exactly the ideal train car(s) to enter because it minimizes the walking needed when you arrive.  Basically, you're doing the walking you have to do anyway before you get on the train.\n* Luggage\n * Coin lockers are a lifesaver, especially if your previous/next accommodation can’t hold your luggage, or you won’t have the time to drop it off.  Most stations will have coin lockers, though most lockers seem to be taken by midday.  If using the coin lockers at Hakone-Yumoto Station, the lockers upstairs and downstairs/outside were quite contested, but if you’re willing to walk a little, there’s some across the street at the Hakone Tozan Bus Information area.  If using the coin lockers in Oshiage station, there should be an area that has escalators up to Solamachi mall, at the bottom is a konbini and lots of lockers.\n* Preparation\n * I used the Ubigi eSIM card, 10GB of data for $17 before discount. Pretty easy to download and install. 10GB was perfect for 2 weeks.  Connectivity was pretty good, though sometimes it was spotty, while my GF’s was fine (she also used Ubigi).  It was difficult to find a working discount code but mine is CHTSB37D to get 20% off.  You can’t make money off the referral code but if you ever refer others with your code, you get a 50% off code (only lasts 6 months, perfect for the semiannual trip to Japan 😅).\n* Other\n * Google Translate's camera feature was amazing, great for anything written in Japanese, like menus.\n * It’s not great for translating longer sentences, e.g. if I wanted to ask someone for something fairly specific.  I actually found ChatGPT to be better at this.\n * If possible, find moments to sit and rest your feet!  This is especially important if your schedule is fairly packed.  For us, the only times we got to sit was at restaurants, and transportation (if there was even a seat), otherwise you’re just constantly on your feet for everything.\n * I like bringing Reese's peanut butter cups as an omiyage gift. I would give these to people who were extra helpful or kind. They don't have anything close in Japan from what I could tell. And all of them were super appreciative of it. Easy to pick up a pantry pack on Amazon.\n * Weather-wise, mid-November was great.  It was no longer humid, but not too cold either.  Jackets needed for morning/evening, otherwise midday was pretty good.  We got to see the fall colors (momiji) though the hot/prolonged summer seemed to have pushed back peak momiji.  If I could choose a more ideal 2 weeks, I think I would’ve targeted the 2nd half of Nov, or last week of Nov/first week of Dec.  We didn’t have a single day of rain, so I’m not complaining!\n * If you’re looking for a photographer, I recommend Thomas who is Kyoto-based and has a great eye and aesthetic ([Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mightytom/), and fellow [redditor](https://www.reddit.com/user/mightytom2020/)).\n\n# Background\n* My second time in Japan, and my girlfriend’s first time. Both Asian American and coming from Houston with basic Japanese vocabulary.\n * My (35M) interests: tea, ceramics, food, culture\n * Girlfriend (32F) interests: stationary, cafes, Pokemon, food, culture\n* Flight booked June (5 months before) using 110k points each via United website. Using points at least gets us Economy, which is 2 checked bags and choosing our seats.  Decided on an open-jaw flight so we can save a little money/time having to take a roundtrip Shinkansen.\n* Hotels booked July (4 months before) using booking.com.\n* Since she was going to all the cities I previously went to last year, outside of Hakone, I gave her priority as to the schedule.  Our schedule was made up of all the things she forwarded me that she found on Instagram, then I added the major attractions (temples, neighborhoods, etc) that I thought she should see on a 1st trip to Japan.\n\n# Itinerary Overview\n* Day 1-3 Osaka\n* Day 3-7 Kyoto\n* Day 7-8 Hakone\n* Day 8-14 Tokyo\n\n***\n\n# Accommodations\nThe only non-negotiables from the GF was a private bathroom, and a nice traditional ryokan when we’re at Hakone.  We’re fairly low maintenance, so didn’t opt for any actual ‘hotels’.  Outside of splurging on the ryokan, I prioritized cost and location.\n\n* Yeah Room Namba (Osaka) - 3/5 - $99 total for 2 nights\n &gt; A small apartment that’s fairly central (Namba area) and very cheap!  A few steps away from a Lawson, and very close to Denden Town.  Unfortunately, bidet didn’t work, which I communicated to the host but they opted not to fix during our stay.\n\n* Platinum Yasaka (Kyoto) - 3/5 - $445 for 4 nights\n &gt; Also a small apartment, but located very close to Gion/Yasaka Shrine, [Ninenzaka](https://imgur.com/Cz2ixMs), Sannenzaka, and Kiyomizu-dera.\n\n* Gyokutei (Hakone) - 5/5 - $538 for 1 night\n &gt; Built in the 50s on the grounds of a former elementary school.  Slightly hard to find, with plenty of reviews all highlighting this; however, this ryokan was fantastic, a good mix of modern and traditional.  A little [garden and pond](https://imgur.com/gAWNSS0) in the middle.  Only a few rooms are available on the property.  Two [public baths](https://imgur.com/vmLaEXy), one for each gender, and will alternate morning and evenings, though both baths are fairly similar.  Tatami mats, with plenty of space and 2 little ‘rooms’, which we didn’t even use, and a mini kitchenette (though I think the staff use this for setting up for the meals).  I believe each room has a private bath (hot spring fed!), either can have a stone tub or [cypress wood tub](https://imgur.com/qNaZixn)!  All the staff were very kind and welcoming.  The stay came with a kaiseki dinner and traditional Japanese breakfast.  NOTE, the food is very seafood-forward, with some being out of my Americanized comfort zone - I had to give my shirako (fish sperm sacs) to my GF.  I would happily recommend this ryokan to friends &amp; family.\n\n* Green Sea Oshiage (Tokyo) - 2/5 - $490 for 6 nights\n &gt;  It’s an apartment within this complex but seems to be managed by someone else.  There was a raw sewage smell in the kitchen area that wasn’t quite fully addressed.  Otherwise, decent space, and fairly close to the Skytree.  Next time I think we’ll try for Asakusa or Ikebukuro, to be a little more central.\n\nNext time, I think I will consider hotels due to some convenience factors: (1) dropping bags off pre-check in, (2) leaving bags post-check out, (3) someone on-site to arrange luggage-forwarding, (4) more certainty of laundry equipment/services.\n\n***\n\nThis time, I won’t organize by day, but by Location and Category (activity/food), just for organization/readability, and to make it not seem like we were able to fit so much in each day (we kind of did, but several places were spontaneous and/or a quick visit.  However, it is chronological within each Location &amp; Category.\n\nExplanation of my ratings:\n&gt; 5/5 - I would highly recommend it to friends, family, and strangers on reddit.  Also, it’s a strong chance I’d go ahead in a future trip, in lieu of trying something new.\n\n&gt; 4/5 - Would recommend.  May visit again, unless there are other things to see and do that competes with this (opportunity cost is important to consider!)\n\n&gt; 3/5 - Somewhat recommend.  It’s okay, worth a visit if you’re in the area.  I probably would not visit again;  to me, a trip to Japan is too expensive/infrequent for it to be filled with places that are just “3 out of 5”.\n\n&gt; 2/5 - Not particularly worth the visit.  Something about this experience was lackluster.\n\n&gt; 1/5 - I would go out of my way to tell people to avoid this.  Terrible experience.\n\nFor food, I have also included the Tabelog score:\n&gt; 3.0 - average.\n\n&gt; 3.5 - very good.\n\n&gt; 3.6 - you'll start to see lines, and prior to opening. Start checking online to see if reservations are required.\n\n&gt; 3.8 - very tough to get into. The ones that didn't have reservations, had insane lines.  For example the 3.86 donut shop in Kyoto last year, I waited almost 2 hours in the rain, and that's after arriving 40 minutes early.\n\n&gt; 4.0 - seemed to apply mostly to high end sushi/kaiseki, e.g. you gotta know someone to get on the list.\n\n# Osaka Activities\n\n* **Various card shops** - 2/5\n\n &gt; Since my last trip, the GF got into collecting Pokemon cards, so I figured I’d check out the Japanese cards at the shops in Denden Town (basically the Akihabara of Osaka), given we were staying so close.  Given the current craze, I wouldn’t recommend it, unless you want to see/feel cards instead of buying off TCGplayer/eBay.  Prices for the popular cards, anything ¥3000+ were 10-25% over market.  I’d imagine the fairly-priced cards have already been picked clean.  Might be a 3/5 if you like cheap IR/full art cards, as I saw plenty at the ¥200-500 range, great as gifts for kids!\n\n* **Osaka Castle** - 5/5\n\n &gt; Incredibly beautiful castle, the copper-green and gold accents are magnificent.  We did not opt to do the inside tour.  Worth seeing at least once!  Note, it is likely a detour as there’s not many other touristy things I’m aware of nearby.\n\n* **Dotonbori** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Likely what comes to mind when you think of Osaka.  Not particularly worth the visit, but you’ll likely be in this area for something else anyway, so go grab your [Glico Man](https://imgur.com/5P5ZW8a) photo while you’re here.  This was probably the 2nd most crowded area during our trip (#1 being Takeshita Street during Japanese Labor Day)\n\n* **BOOKOFF PLUS Namba Ebisubashi Store** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Solid selection of stuff.  Being a “plus” basically 2-3x the space, with stuff like Pokemon cards, collectibles, figurines, games, and a bunch of other random stuff.  My GF found some Kpop cards to get as gifts, and I actually found cheap vintage cards (the popular cards were overpriced like the other shops).  Note, like last year, I was on a quest to find the volume 1 of some manga.  This time, I was looking for Dandadan and Kagurabachi, which they didn’t have.  FYI, for the most popular manga, every Bookoff has a special section just for them.\n\n* **Pokemon Center DX** - 4/5\n\n &gt; We were here for the Pokemon Cafe (mentioned down in the food section).  I’ll pretty much only mention Pokemon Center once (even though we went to 5 this trip), it’ll be aggregated here.  Most merch could be found at any of the centers, there were some that weren’t.  That said, if you see something you like, just buy it, as there’s no guarantee you’ll see it at another.  As for Pokemon card packs, the newest sets were usually sold out, but there’s plenty of older ones.  We ended up going to the Skytree one right at open, and people were practically running to Pokemon Center, with lots of foreigners (and scalpery-looking folks) right at the checkout to buy the newer sets.  If you do visit midday, the line to checkout can be quite long, so if you’re in a rush, designate someone to get in line early.\n\n* **Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan** - 5/5\n\n &gt; Excellent aquarium, fairly affordable tickets as well.  Slightly out of the way, assuming you’re not going to/from USJ.  One of a few aquariums with whale sharks, let alone two.  The jellyfish and crabs are neat as well.  They have stamp stations at most of the larger exhibits, so bring a notebook.  If you’re a big otter fan, be sure to time your visit (or walk back) to the river otters during their feeding times (11:30, 13:30, 15:30), which is the first exhibit you’ll see.  The ledge/balcony isn’t too wide, so if you REALLY want to see it, you’ll probably have to stand there 10-15 minutes early, because others are doing so as well!\n\n* **Nintendo OSAKA, at Daimaru Umeda Store** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Good for all your official Nintendo merch.  Nothing too crazy, just your typical merch: clothes, accessories, home goods, toys and plushies.\n\n* **B-Side Label Shinsaibashi** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Very cool sticker shop!  There’s definitely something for everyone, perfect little gift for someone to decorate their water bottle, laptop, phone case, etc.  There’s some pop culture ones like Pokemon and Naruto.  They also have some Japanese artists, and city-exclusive ones.  My only criticism is their logo is too large relative to the rest of the sticker.  They also have tote bags and shirts.\n\n# Osaka Food\n\n* **Fukutaro Honten Main Store** - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.71\n\n &gt; Excellent [okonomiyaki](https://imgur.com/hUE2ayR) and negiyaki (which I like more!). Actually went here last year, and also for the first meal in Japan.  The wait wasn’t as long as last year.\n\n* **Cinnamoroll Cafe Osaka Namba Ebisubashi Store** - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.20\n\n &gt; I believe this is one of two official Cinnamoroll Cafes in Japan, the other being in Shinjuku, Tokyo.  This was very easy to reserve (unlike Pokemon Cafe and Ghibli Museum).  We ended up being the only ones in the special room from opening time until we left.  Per the GF: “cute, [cutely decorated](https://imgur.com/IYLFfTx), food as pictured on the menu, flavor meh but expected, not as much interaction as Pokemon”.  It’s not a lot of food, though I’m sure it’s kid-portioned.  Some of the decals were peeling off.  There’s also a merch area.  Okay if a travel companion REALLY wants to go, but if you’re just casually interested, I would skip this.  Surprised the Tabelog score was not lower.\n\n* **Pokemon Cafe** - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.32\n\n &gt; [Decor](https://imgur.com/UypvqUd) is great, [food](https://imgur.com/b4ThELe) is okay, and there’s a little [appearance by Pikachu](https://imgur.com/UU5EZnL) and a staff member doing the “if you’re happy and you know it” song with everyone there.  You order off an ipad, and there’s a few items to choose from (not as much as I would’ve expected.  And similar to the Cinnamoroll Cafe, I wouldn’t go here for the food quality.  There are some exclusive merch that you can only get by getting a reservation.  The “A” seating area would be the best, if you want to be close to Pikachu.  Reservations are quite difficult to secure, [my tips/experience here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1o4l04e/pokemon_cafe_reservation_tips/).\n  For the hardcore fans, I think it’d very much be a 5/5.\n\n* **Kawafuku Honten** - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.51\n\n &gt; Udon shop that was nearby/central and with a decent Tabelog score.  No wait, and fast service.  Lots of items to choose from on the menu.  Good value, but not going to be featured on Instagram anytime soon.  Note, if you get the [udon with shrimp tempura](https://imgur.com/iy2MKfH) (one of the recommended items), it’s basically dunked in the udon, so it ends up being soggy.  This might be a regional thing, if you like yours crunchy, might be worth asking for it to be separate!\n\n* **Excelsior Caffé, Shinsaibashi** - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.07\n\n &gt; Honestly, I don’t even know if anything else is good, because we went in for the Cremia ice cream!  It was also one of the cheapest, clocking in at around ¥600.  The hype is real, the Cremia was so rich and creamy, just miles above anything you’d find in the US and the cone was tasty as well.  They have plenty of seating in the back.  If Costco could just carry tubs of these, that would be the DREAM.  They’d also sell out ASAP.  Note, not every Excelsior has them.  If a shop does carry Cremia, they usually had a sign out front, so keep your eyes peeled when you’re walking around!\n\n# Kyoto Activities\n\n* **[Nijo Castle](https://imgur.com/NqP67KJ)** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Pretty neat castle, the castle grounds are pretty enormous.  Pretty historic, as the last Tokugawa shogunate announced handing over power back to the Emperor at Ninomaru Palace.  Plenty of signage in English that explains things.\n\n* **Marukyu Koyamaen - Nishinotoin** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Fairly close to Nijo Castle, one of the popular matcha brands.  They do enforce a limit, and explicitly mention which matchas are not to be used in lattes.  They also have a cafe here.\n\n* **[Nishiki Tenmangu Shrine](https://imgur.com/tL7N9cN)** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Shrine to the god of scholarship/learning.  Established in 1003, but moved to its current location near Nishiki Market in 1587 (crazy how old some of these are!).  Very convenient shrine to go to if your itinerary is light on shrines.\n\n* **[MOCOMOCO Arashiyama](https://imgur.com/533Jb5G)** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Kimono rental.  Opened slightly earlier than other shops at 8:45 instead of 9.  Decent selection, price was okay.  I would check your kimono for any stains since mine had some, but they provided a haori for free to cover it up.  Only 1 person to help the guys, but it’s fairly quick, less than 15 minutes.  The women go upstairs and there’s ~6 staff upstairs, maybe 45-60 min.  Most of the staff are Chinese (moved here 10-20 years ago).\n\n* **[Daikaku-ji](https://imgur.com/oYrKQAD)** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Excellent temple, very very few people here.  They have a great bamboo grove, much better than Arashiyama’s (if you want your photos).  There’s a man-made lake.  Slightly out of the way, so you have to take a bus here (which was not on time at all, when we wanted to go to Tenryu-ji).  Why’d we go?  I proposed to my GF here, and the photographer recommended it.  It turned out to be a fantastic choice (we also saw two other couples taking what seemed to be engagement photos here as the men were in hakama.  Lots of picturesque backdrops for photos to remember Japan by.\n\n* **Tenryu-ji** - 4/5\n\n &gt; A UNESCO World Heritage Site, we were mainly here for its restaurant, Shigetsu.  We didn’t go inside any other structures, but the [outside garden](https://imgur.com/hK2vNgt), known as the Garden of a Hundred Flowers, is quite beautiful.\n\n* **[Arashiyama Bamboo Forest](https://imgur.com/EdUf14t)** - 3/5\n\n &gt; The famous bamboo forest you’ll see on social media.  Very close to Tenryu-ji, so you might as well check it out if you’re already in the area.  Yes it’s crowded, but not shoulder-to-shoulder.  Don’t expect to get any photos with no one else in the background.  For us, Daikaku-ji was excellent for that shot.\n\n* **Arashiyama Miffy Sakura Kitchen** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Good for the Miffy fans, there’s also a separate bakery here as well.\n\n* **Kimono Forest** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Neat art installation that ends up being a good background for photos, especially if you’re already in a kimono.  It is lit up a night, worth checking out since it's part of the Randen tram station.\n\n* **Platz** - 3/5\n\n &gt; We stumbled across this local shop.  Established around 1890, they sell homegoods and their own handmade cushions/futons.  Owner speaks excellent English.\n\n* **[Fushimi Inari Taisha](https://imgur.com/sppTCrN)** - 4/5\n\n &gt; We went here at 8am, it wasn’t too crowded.  Maybe only had to wait less than one minute, cumulatively, to allow people to take their photos.  Since I didn’t go past the ‘crossroads’ last year, we decided to climb up to the summit, e.g. Kami-no-Yashiro shrine.  Having experienced it now, I would say ‘summit’ it if you enjoy hiking or want to check it off, otherwise reaching the crossroads is 95% of the Fushimi Inari experience.  For that extra 5%, you spent an extra 30-45 minutes (and, importantly, feet stamina!) that could be spent exploring something new, just my two cents.\n\n* **Miel Mie** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Specialty honey store, with a cafe as well.  They have a slew of single origin honey, both domestic and international, some of the varieties include sakura, coffee, blueberry, lavender, almond, etc.  Super cool for honey fans;  I bought a 3-pack for a honey connoisseur friend.\n\n* **TOBICHI Kyoto** - 3.5/5\n\n &gt; One of two official Hobonichi stores.  Excellent gifts for those who like stationary.  They have collaborations with artists, as well as pop culture like One Piece and Junji Ito.  I rated this as a casual non-stationary person, but for those invested in the Hobonichi system like my GF, this is definitely a 5/5.  She spent quite a lot here, especially since they got rid of the free shipping when buying online.\n\n* **[Kinkaku-ji](https://imgur.com/LUBfLz6)** - 4/5\n\n &gt; The famous golden pavilion.  Definitely a must for a first-timer.  There’s not much else here, and a bit out of the way, though if you have the time, you can check out Ryoan-ji nearby\n\n* **[Kiyomizu-dera](https://imgur.com/4m6kUHH)** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Probably the most famous temple in Kyoto.  You likely will have to make the trek uphill to the [entrance](https://imgur.com/P3zU6S4).  There’s a bit to see &amp; do (if partaking in temple activity).  Not too crowded in terms of moving around, but the photo spots are quite crowded.  There is a bit of a wait for the goshuin here.  Excellent [foliage](https://imgur.com/1yCMiIR).\n\n* **Asahido Honten** - 3.5/5\n\n &gt; Ceramics and other home goods.  Established right outside Kiyomizu-dera in 1870.  There seems to be 3 stores in the vicinity, each a different focus.  The closest one had the super expensive, traditional stuff.  Another had a more modern aesthetic.  If you’re big on ceramics, definitely check this out.  I picked up some nice hammered spoons here.  \n\n* **Shogoin Yatsuhashi** - 3/5\n\n &gt; A confectionary shop we passed by that sold yatsuhashi, the souvenir snacks that you’ll see around Kyoto (mochi-like triangles with a filling in the center).  It’s pretty cheap, though it doesn’t seem like it would hold up well when travelling, expiration for the soft kind seems to be 1-2 weeks.\n\n* **Yoroshi Cosmetics** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Seems to be a pretty new brand.  It drew a good number of customers (including us) because of its wall of hand creams tins, with a design for [each day of the year](https://imgur.com/KvAQTwS).  They’re all the same fragrance, but they have other products (balms, bathbombs, etc) and other fragrances as well.\n\n* **Itoh Kyuemon Shimizu Sanneizaka** - 3/5\n\n &gt; Somewhat well-known matcha brand.  I’ve definitely seen their name on the special matcha- and hojicha-flavored KitKats.  Their stuff was noticeably more expensive than ones like Marukyu Koyamaen and Ippodo.\n\n* **John's Blend Kyoto** - 4/5 (GF’s)\n\n &gt; You can create your own fragrance sachet by choosing among musk, kimono fabric, drawstring, and charms.  Fun experience and lasting fragrance per the GF.\n\n* **Wargo (Ninenzaka)** - 3/5\n\n &gt; A hairpin chain that I also noticed at Nishiki Market and in Tokyo.  Lots of modern designs.  If getting it as a souvenir, they also sell a neat box with various designs.\n\n* **Donguri Kyowakoku** - 3.5/5\n\n &gt; An official Studio Ghibli merchandise store/chain.  Selection was decent and on-par, if not better than, the merch area inside Ghibli Museum.  A little pricey, but you're getting official merch, and it's pretty much in line with prices at other shops like Pokemon Center or Jump Shop, so temper expectations accordingly. There's a giant Totoro right when you walk in and with some room to take a picture with it.\n\n* **Washikurabu Kodaijiten** - 5/5 (GF’s)\n\n &gt; Local, small business.  Per the GF, a lot of washi paper others didn’t have, very cute, caution: bad English\n\n# Kyoto Food\n\n* **Okakidokoro Terakoyahonpo Nishikiichiba Sohonten** - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.07\n\n &gt; Traditional senbei (rice cracker) shop located in Nishiki Market.  We passed by and decided to try it.  There’s a few flavors to choose from, worth a shot if you want to try freshly made senbei.\n\n* **[Hikiniku to Kome](https://imgur.com/8Da28eV)** - 4.5/5 - Tabelog 3.53\n\n &gt; One of the most hyped restaurants on Instagram. The [morning line](https://imgur.com/GZnnvnF) to get a dinner reservation for later that evening was quite long. We got there right at 9am when they would start processing people in line, and there were ~20 in front of us, and lots more as time passed. It went quickly as the person takes your name and tells you the available slots.  The latest time we could get was 5:45pm, so if you want a later time, definitely show up early in the morning.  You get 3 hamburg steaks and they give you a paper that explains how they recommend you eat them: by itself, with grated radish and ponzu, and with raw egg. My favorite was with the ponzu. There's also PLENTY of condiments to have it exactly how you like it. Each one is quite juicy, and goes amazing over rice.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  My first one was fairly raw in the middle, so they made a new one, no questions asked.  You can have as much rice as you'd like, and the rice is very good!  Was it worth it? Hamburg steak isn't revolutionary, it's gonna taste pretty good if you grill it. I think where Hikiniku shines is providing the full spread of condiments (the homemade ponzu!!!) so you can 'mix-and-match' to really enjoy your - if we're being honest - meatballs. If you're hungry, I highly recommend getting an extra one.  Price is quite fair, I would've thought it would be priced higher given how many foreigners come, but you're paying just $12 for this experience.  We opted not to reserve in advance via Tablecheck for a hefty fee, and whose reservation system is total trash. I tried the 'free' one a week in advance, and it never really opened up. So again, recommend waiting early in the morning if you don't want to pay a fee.\n\n* **Shigetsu** - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.57 - Michelin Bib Gourmand and Green Star\n\n &gt; One of the few places to get shojin ryori (Japanese Buddhist cuisine), and on the grounds of Tenryu-ji.  You can choose between 3 courses, and the price range is actually quite large, from ¥3800 to ¥6500 to ¥9000.  I went for the most expensive one as when would you get another chance to try shojin ryori? Though I think the other two would be pretty good as well!  The spread of food was quite amazing and quite tasty.  If you're complaining about the lack of veggies in your food during your trip, shojin ryori definitely has you covered: mushrooms, soybean, even bamboo, and a few others we couldn't quite identify.  When the food started trickling in, it was actually [overwhelming](https://imgur.com/SksYTUs).  A bowl of matcha as well! The persimmon was quite ripe and gigantic.  Note, you will have to sit on tatami mats, and eat from a tatami table. Our room was quite spacious, and only 1 other couple was with us.  Recommended to reserve this in advance as they will likely sell out (they had a sign saying so during our visit, and I saw a few come by disappointed).\n\n* **% ARABICA Kyoto Arashiyama** - 4/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.58\n\n &gt; Decent coffee per the GF, but fairly long line.  After your order, then you’ll be waiting for them to make your drink (surprise, there’s a backlog).  No seating inside, but you can pay for a reserved room.  At least you can enjoy your drink outside with the riverview.\n\n* **Unagi Hirokawa** - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.69\n\n &gt; Found it as it was the highest-rated unagi/unadon restaurant in the Arahsiyama area.  Reservations required, and a ¥3000 deposit per person that is applied against your total.  Highly recommend getting either the B course or C course (if you're really hungry).  The unagi yubamaki (eel in tofu skin) is excellent.  The main course is the [glazed grilled eel over rice](https://imgur.com/DqMs3Ie), quite decadent.  The only nitpick would be if the eel had a bit more of that char.\n\n* **Honke Owariya** - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.49\n\n &gt; The oldest restaurant in Kyoto, and one of the oldest in Japan/the world.  They’ve been on this spot since 1465, first as a confectionary shop then switched when soba became popular for monks.  Highly recommend getting either of the two specials, the Nishin Soba Set, a hot soba focused on fish, or the Hourai, a cold soba where you [mix-and-match 8 toppings](https://imgur.com/0hEZOmk).  Be sure to order the rikyu-fu, which is sweet, fried wheat gluten topped with grated radish and covered in ponzu sauce.  Okay, let's talk about the line: CRAZY.  We [waited 2 hours](https://imgur.com/wrwy75x), from when we got there right at 11am, and sat down just before 1pm.  What’s ironic is I made fun of my GF for picking places to go to based on Instagram since they would likely have long lines, but I chose this spot, which had the longest line of them all...\n\n* **WEEKENDERS COFFEE Tomikoji** - 4/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.53\n\n &gt; Good coffee per the GF.  Fast service, but not a good spot to hang out.  People were sitting on the railing.  Luckily the very nice bench they had opened up and we snatched it up.\n\n* **Tenjaku** - 4.5/5 - Tabelog 3.66 - Michelin 1 Star\n\n &gt; Chef Ryo Nishioka took over his grandfather's business and has made tempura a key element of his kaiseki offering.  The [hassun](https://imgur.com/ivSFFhg) (a little bit of everything) is his selection of small, seasonal appetizers.  Very beautifully crafted, both composition in and taste. Very seafood-forward, no land animals that I can remember: barracuda, amadai, shrimp, Spanish mackerel, crab, clam. His tempura is at the level of other Michelin-starred tempura shops.  Only 1 seating a night, an 8-person hinoki wood counter, and two others helping him. It's quite an intimate experience. He engages with the guests, answering questions as well as asking us some in return. He's quite kind and makes jokes, it almost feels like a dinner party.  He changes his menu and his ceramics 12 times a year.  He noticed I was left-handed and made changes accordingly, great eye for details.  Easy to reserve via PocketConcierge, no fee unlike tableall... His pricing is quite fair given the quality of food, intimate atmosphere, and especially compared to other Michelin-level offerings at dinner time. It is a bit far from the other spots tourists come to Kyoto for, but I think that makes this restaurant more of a hidden gem (though I don't believe our counter had any locals).\n\n* **Takinoya** - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.29\n\n &gt; A small shop in Kiyomizu-dera right next to the ‘waterfall’, hence the name translates to “Waterfall House”.  We passed by and stopped for the amazake, note this one is more traditional and has ginger.  They have udon, tofu, and other desserts.\n\n* **KUMONOCHA Kiyomizu Sannenzaka** - 4.5/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.41\n\n &gt; GF found on Instagram, specifically the [kumo no mousse](https://imgur.com/ygdCDjm), which is cloud-shaped, filled with red bean, and comes with a matcha.  She liked the set and the taste.  Only downside is they don’t give you too much matcha, and the milk came with too much ice.\n\n* **Bunnosuke Chaya Kyoto** - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.14\n\n &gt; Passed by and the GF saw they had a collab with Haikyu!!, so we got one of their [warabi mochi soft serves](https://imgur.com/7F8lt4i), which came with a character acrylic.  They had a cafe area, but this item was take-out only.  Lots of Japanese girls here for the collab.  Established in 1909, there’s lots of other desserts that looked to be worth trying.\n\n* **Kyo Tsukemono Mori Yasaka** - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.02\n\n &gt; Just outside of Yasaka, we passed by this onigiri shop, with a focus on [tsukemono (Japanese pickles) as the filling](https://imgur.com/gvwxLK3).  We got the traditional wild Kyoto vegetables, small dried sardines with Japanese pepper, and grilled soy sauce &amp; corn butter ones.  The corn one was meh, but the wild vegetables one was great.  Seating was a little difficult, seemed to be mainly Japanese customers.\n\n* **[Yoshinosushi](https://imgur.com/AV1grF4)** - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.22\n\n &gt; Local sushiya near the Pontocho area, found via Reddit recommendation.  Fairly small inside with a mix of locals and tourists.  Lots of fish to choose from, and he was able to make toru-taku, which was not on the menu.  Prices were cheap (though not Sushiro-cheap), and there was a sign outside that said it was 10% off that day.  Overall, the [fish wasn’t bad](https://imgur.com/Gx15320), but wasn’t the high quality we were expecting being in Japan, it was fairly comparable to the mid-tier sushi places back home.\n\n* **Shunsai Imari** - 4/5\n\n &gt; [Obanzai (Kyoto-style) breakfast](https://imgur.com/U5koyAU). Japanese comfort food. Very affordable and filling breakfast to start the day (if you're sick of having konbini food). There are limited seats and they do get booked fairly quickly. Plenty of seats available when reservations opened for the month 2 months before (e.g. September 1 for November).\n\n* **Nakamura Tokichi - Kyoto Station** - 4/5\n\n &gt; Well known matcha brand that has a store with a restaurant at Kyoto station.  They have a subset of the menu items that I saw at the original location in Uji.  I ordered the [hot seasonal matcha buckwheat noodles with chicken, combo-ed with the tea jelly dessert](https://imgur.com/b3cDkiN).  Worth the visit if you need to grab a meal before your train to the next city.  You can also buy the matcha jelly/pudding in a to-go container.  Don’t forget to buy some tea as well.\n\n---\n\n# [Part 2 here](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1pwzcm9/14_days_in_nov_2025_118_places_to_see_eat_at_in/)",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;My girlfriend (now fiance) and I just came back from Japan last week. This trip report is to 1) journal our experience and 2) and share that experience with others so their future trips to Japan can be more amazing. Happy to answer questions!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My first report was for my &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1c23f7d/march_2024_2week_solo_trip_report_osaka_kyoto_uji/\"&gt;first trip back in March 2024&lt;/a&gt;.  This time, I have my tips first followed by our detailed trip report, and with better formatting inspired by &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1ermgvc/trip_report_nov_dec_2023_tokyo_kyoto_osaka/\"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Tips and recommendations&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hotels\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Booking.com seemed to have the best availability and pricing compared to Expedia and Airbnb.  I also took advantage of using Rakuten’s link during the ‘travel week’ promo, getting 8% cashback, though the cashback seems to take a while…&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Other than Tokyo, many accommodations had free cancellation up to the month before or even up to 3 days before.  This is helpful if you want to remain flexible, e.g. check for new/cheaper availabilities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Booking.com also had the ‘private bathroom’ filter which my girlfriend was adamant on.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I recommend checking as early as you can.  If something looks good and has free cancellation, book that and keep shopping around.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I checked roughly every 2 weeks leading up to our trip. Around the 1.5 month mark, the availability of places that fit our criteria significantly dropped.  Another interpretation: the price for similar places/locations were at least 20% more expensive.  My guess is the sweet spot is 3-4 months before.  Your mileage may vary!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Shopping\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you know Chinese and you are shopping at touristy spots, many staff are/speak Chinese.  We encountered it quite frequently at drug stores, the Reddit-popular suitcase store Ginza Karen, and Don Quijote.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Food\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If there is one singular food recommendation from this whole report, it’s Himawari Sushi Shintoshi!  Affordable and good conveyor belt sushi.  Read about it in the Tokyo Food section.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Don’t sleep on the chain restaurants.  Personally, I really enjoy Tendon Tenya for tempura.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Tabelog is a fairly reliable rating website for food in Japan, just know that their algorithm works differently.  It seems like businesses start at a 3, then move up based on the ratings of power users, who have the most impact.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you need more fiber in your diet (likely so), most konbini have ‘Fibre Mini’ drinks or the ‘in’ peach/grape jelly packs.  The jelly is good but slightly difficult to slurp.  If you want to be more economical, I would recommend buying the sticks of powdered fiber (dextrin) at a drugstore.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Trains\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Some tips for getting to/on the right train, do the following checks:\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Are you at the right numbered platform?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Is the train color/letter correct, either on hanging signage or the train digital sign?&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Does the time match what&amp;#39;s on Google Maps? Some trains share the same platform, or you might need a Local, Express, etc.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;See if signage at the platform mention the next stop, does that match the next stop on Google Maps? Signage to look for include signs, pillars, and walls, like the walk across the platform if underground.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Try to exit from the correct gate, this will save time waiting at lights outside or dealing with the weather. If a station is big enough, it may take 15-20 minutes just to get back on track from exiting the wrong gate.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you have time waiting for the train, for many trains, Google Maps will list exactly the ideal train car(s) to enter because it minimizes the walking needed when you arrive.  Basically, you&amp;#39;re doing the walking you have to do anyway before you get on the train.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Luggage\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Coin lockers are a lifesaver, especially if your previous/next accommodation can’t hold your luggage, or you won’t have the time to drop it off.  Most stations will have coin lockers, though most lockers seem to be taken by midday.  If using the coin lockers at Hakone-Yumoto Station, the lockers upstairs and downstairs/outside were quite contested, but if you’re willing to walk a little, there’s some across the street at the Hakone Tozan Bus Information area.  If using the coin lockers in Oshiage station, there should be an area that has escalators up to Solamachi mall, at the bottom is a konbini and lots of lockers.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Preparation\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I used the Ubigi eSIM card, 10GB of data for $17 before discount. Pretty easy to download and install. 10GB was perfect for 2 weeks.  Connectivity was pretty good, though sometimes it was spotty, while my GF’s was fine (she also used Ubigi).  It was difficult to find a working discount code but mine is CHTSB37D to get 20% off.  You can’t make money off the referral code but if you ever refer others with your code, you get a 50% off code (only lasts 6 months, perfect for the semiannual trip to Japan 😅).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Other\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Google Translate&amp;#39;s camera feature was amazing, great for anything written in Japanese, like menus.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It’s not great for translating longer sentences, e.g. if I wanted to ask someone for something fairly specific.  I actually found ChatGPT to be better at this.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If possible, find moments to sit and rest your feet!  This is especially important if your schedule is fairly packed.  For us, the only times we got to sit was at restaurants, and transportation (if there was even a seat), otherwise you’re just constantly on your feet for everything.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I like bringing Reese&amp;#39;s peanut butter cups as an omiyage gift. I would give these to people who were extra helpful or kind. They don&amp;#39;t have anything close in Japan from what I could tell. And all of them were super appreciative of it. Easy to pick up a pantry pack on Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Weather-wise, mid-November was great.  It was no longer humid, but not too cold either.  Jackets needed for morning/evening, otherwise midday was pretty good.  We got to see the fall colors (momiji) though the hot/prolonged summer seemed to have pushed back peak momiji.  If I could choose a more ideal 2 weeks, I think I would’ve targeted the 2nd half of Nov, or last week of Nov/first week of Dec.  We didn’t have a single day of rain, so I’m not complaining!&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;If you’re looking for a photographer, I recommend Thomas who is Kyoto-based and has a great eye and aesthetic (&lt;a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mightytom/\"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, and fellow &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mightytom2020/\"&gt;redditor&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My second time in Japan, and my girlfriend’s first time. Both Asian American and coming from Houston with basic Japanese vocabulary.\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My (35M) interests: tea, ceramics, food, culture&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Girlfriend (32F) interests: stationary, cafes, Pokemon, food, culture&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Flight booked June (5 months before) using 110k points each via United website. Using points at least gets us Economy, which is 2 checked bags and choosing our seats.  Decided on an open-jaw flight so we can save a little money/time having to take a roundtrip Shinkansen.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Hotels booked July (4 months before) using booking.com.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Since she was going to all the cities I previously went to last year, outside of Hakone, I gave her priority as to the schedule.  Our schedule was made up of all the things she forwarded me that she found on Instagram, then I added the major attractions (temples, neighborhoods, etc) that I thought she should see on a 1st trip to Japan.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Itinerary Overview&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Day 1-3 Osaka&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Day 3-7 Kyoto&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Day 7-8 Hakone&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Day 8-14 Tokyo&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Accommodations&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The only non-negotiables from the GF was a private bathroom, and a nice traditional ryokan when we’re at Hakone.  We’re fairly low maintenance, so didn’t opt for any actual ‘hotels’.  Outside of splurging on the ryokan, I prioritized cost and location.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah Room Namba (Osaka) - 3/5 - $99 total for 2 nights&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A small apartment that’s fairly central (Namba area) and very cheap!  A few steps away from a Lawson, and very close to Denden Town.  Unfortunately, bidet didn’t work, which I communicated to the host but they opted not to fix during our stay.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Platinum Yasaka (Kyoto) - 3/5 - $445 for 4 nights&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also a small apartment, but located very close to Gion/Yasaka Shrine, &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/Cz2ixMs\"&gt;Ninenzaka&lt;/a&gt;, Sannenzaka, and Kiyomizu-dera.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gyokutei (Hakone) - 5/5 - $538 for 1 night&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Built in the 50s on the grounds of a former elementary school.  Slightly hard to find, with plenty of reviews all highlighting this; however, this ryokan was fantastic, a good mix of modern and traditional.  A little &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/gAWNSS0\"&gt;garden and pond&lt;/a&gt; in the middle.  Only a few rooms are available on the property.  Two &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/vmLaEXy\"&gt;public baths&lt;/a&gt;, one for each gender, and will alternate morning and evenings, though both baths are fairly similar.  Tatami mats, with plenty of space and 2 little ‘rooms’, which we didn’t even use, and a mini kitchenette (though I think the staff use this for setting up for the meals).  I believe each room has a private bath (hot spring fed!), either can have a stone tub or &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/qNaZixn\"&gt;cypress wood tub&lt;/a&gt;!  All the staff were very kind and welcoming.  The stay came with a kaiseki dinner and traditional Japanese breakfast.  NOTE, the food is very seafood-forward, with some being out of my Americanized comfort zone - I had to give my shirako (fish sperm sacs) to my GF.  I would happily recommend this ryokan to friends &amp;amp; family.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green Sea Oshiage (Tokyo) - 2/5 - $490 for 6 nights&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It’s an apartment within this complex but seems to be managed by someone else.  There was a raw sewage smell in the kitchen area that wasn’t quite fully addressed.  Otherwise, decent space, and fairly close to the Skytree.  Next time I think we’ll try for Asakusa or Ikebukuro, to be a little more central.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Next time, I think I will consider hotels due to some convenience factors: (1) dropping bags off pre-check in, (2) leaving bags post-check out, (3) someone on-site to arrange luggage-forwarding, (4) more certainty of laundry equipment/services.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This time, I won’t organize by day, but by Location and Category (activity/food), just for organization/readability, and to make it not seem like we were able to fit so much in each day (we kind of did, but several places were spontaneous and/or a quick visit.  However, it is chronological within each Location &amp;amp; Category.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Explanation of my ratings:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;5/5 - I would highly recommend it to friends, family, and strangers on reddit.  Also, it’s a strong chance I’d go ahead in a future trip, in lieu of trying something new.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4/5 - Would recommend.  May visit again, unless there are other things to see and do that competes with this (opportunity cost is important to consider!)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3/5 - Somewhat recommend.  It’s okay, worth a visit if you’re in the area.  I probably would not visit again;  to me, a trip to Japan is too expensive/infrequent for it to be filled with places that are just “3 out of 5”.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2/5 - Not particularly worth the visit.  Something about this experience was lackluster.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1/5 - I would go out of my way to tell people to avoid this.  Terrible experience.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For food, I have also included the Tabelog score:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3.0 - average.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.5 - very good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.6 - you&amp;#39;ll start to see lines, and prior to opening. Start checking online to see if reservations are required.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3.8 - very tough to get into. The ones that didn&amp;#39;t have reservations, had insane lines.  For example the 3.86 donut shop in Kyoto last year, I waited almost 2 hours in the rain, and that&amp;#39;s after arriving 40 minutes early.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4.0 - seemed to apply mostly to high end sushi/kaiseki, e.g. you gotta know someone to get on the list.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Osaka Activities&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Various card shops&lt;/strong&gt; - 2/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Since my last trip, the GF got into collecting Pokemon cards, so I figured I’d check out the Japanese cards at the shops in Denden Town (basically the Akihabara of Osaka), given we were staying so close.  Given the current craze, I wouldn’t recommend it, unless you want to see/feel cards instead of buying off TCGplayer/eBay.  Prices for the popular cards, anything ¥3000+ were 10-25% over market.  I’d imagine the fairly-priced cards have already been picked clean.  Might be a 3/5 if you like cheap IR/full art cards, as I saw plenty at the ¥200-500 range, great as gifts for kids!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Osaka Castle&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Incredibly beautiful castle, the copper-green and gold accents are magnificent.  We did not opt to do the inside tour.  Worth seeing at least once!  Note, it is likely a detour as there’s not many other touristy things I’m aware of nearby.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dotonbori&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Likely what comes to mind when you think of Osaka.  Not particularly worth the visit, but you’ll likely be in this area for something else anyway, so go grab your &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/5P5ZW8a\"&gt;Glico Man&lt;/a&gt; photo while you’re here.  This was probably the 2nd most crowded area during our trip (#1 being Takeshita Street during Japanese Labor Day)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOOKOFF PLUS Namba Ebisubashi Store&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Solid selection of stuff.  Being a “plus” basically 2-3x the space, with stuff like Pokemon cards, collectibles, figurines, games, and a bunch of other random stuff.  My GF found some Kpop cards to get as gifts, and I actually found cheap vintage cards (the popular cards were overpriced like the other shops).  Note, like last year, I was on a quest to find the volume 1 of some manga.  This time, I was looking for Dandadan and Kagurabachi, which they didn’t have.  FYI, for the most popular manga, every Bookoff has a special section just for them.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokemon Center DX&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We were here for the Pokemon Cafe (mentioned down in the food section).  I’ll pretty much only mention Pokemon Center once (even though we went to 5 this trip), it’ll be aggregated here.  Most merch could be found at any of the centers, there were some that weren’t.  That said, if you see something you like, just buy it, as there’s no guarantee you’ll see it at another.  As for Pokemon card packs, the newest sets were usually sold out, but there’s plenty of older ones.  We ended up going to the Skytree one right at open, and people were practically running to Pokemon Center, with lots of foreigners (and scalpery-looking folks) right at the checkout to buy the newer sets.  If you do visit midday, the line to checkout can be quite long, so if you’re in a rush, designate someone to get in line early.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Excellent aquarium, fairly affordable tickets as well.  Slightly out of the way, assuming you’re not going to/from USJ.  One of a few aquariums with whale sharks, let alone two.  The jellyfish and crabs are neat as well.  They have stamp stations at most of the larger exhibits, so bring a notebook.  If you’re a big otter fan, be sure to time your visit (or walk back) to the river otters during their feeding times (11:30, 13:30, 15:30), which is the first exhibit you’ll see.  The ledge/balcony isn’t too wide, so if you REALLY want to see it, you’ll probably have to stand there 10-15 minutes early, because others are doing so as well!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nintendo OSAKA, at Daimaru Umeda Store&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Good for all your official Nintendo merch.  Nothing too crazy, just your typical merch: clothes, accessories, home goods, toys and plushies.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B-Side Label Shinsaibashi&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Very cool sticker shop!  There’s definitely something for everyone, perfect little gift for someone to decorate their water bottle, laptop, phone case, etc.  There’s some pop culture ones like Pokemon and Naruto.  They also have some Japanese artists, and city-exclusive ones.  My only criticism is their logo is too large relative to the rest of the sticker.  They also have tote bags and shirts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Osaka Food&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fukutaro Honten Main Store&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.71&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Excellent &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/hUE2ayR\"&gt;okonomiyaki&lt;/a&gt; and negiyaki (which I like more!). Actually went here last year, and also for the first meal in Japan.  The wait wasn’t as long as last year.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cinnamoroll Cafe Osaka Namba Ebisubashi Store&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.20&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I believe this is one of two official Cinnamoroll Cafes in Japan, the other being in Shinjuku, Tokyo.  This was very easy to reserve (unlike Pokemon Cafe and Ghibli Museum).  We ended up being the only ones in the special room from opening time until we left.  Per the GF: “cute, &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/IYLFfTx\"&gt;cutely decorated&lt;/a&gt;, food as pictured on the menu, flavor meh but expected, not as much interaction as Pokemon”.  It’s not a lot of food, though I’m sure it’s kid-portioned.  Some of the decals were peeling off.  There’s also a merch area.  Okay if a travel companion REALLY wants to go, but if you’re just casually interested, I would skip this.  Surprised the Tabelog score was not lower.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pokemon Cafe&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.32&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/UypvqUd\"&gt;Decor&lt;/a&gt; is great, &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/b4ThELe\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; is okay, and there’s a little &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/UU5EZnL\"&gt;appearance by Pikachu&lt;/a&gt; and a staff member doing the “if you’re happy and you know it” song with everyone there.  You order off an ipad, and there’s a few items to choose from (not as much as I would’ve expected.  And similar to the Cinnamoroll Cafe, I wouldn’t go here for the food quality.  There are some exclusive merch that you can only get by getting a reservation.  The “A” seating area would be the best, if you want to be close to Pikachu.  Reservations are quite difficult to secure, &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1o4l04e/pokemon_cafe_reservation_tips/\"&gt;my tips/experience here&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the hardcore fans, I think it’d very much be a 5/5.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kawafuku Honten&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.51&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Udon shop that was nearby/central and with a decent Tabelog score.  No wait, and fast service.  Lots of items to choose from on the menu.  Good value, but not going to be featured on Instagram anytime soon.  Note, if you get the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/iy2MKfH\"&gt;udon with shrimp tempura&lt;/a&gt; (one of the recommended items), it’s basically dunked in the udon, so it ends up being soggy.  This might be a regional thing, if you like yours crunchy, might be worth asking for it to be separate!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excelsior Caffé, Shinsaibashi&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.07&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don’t even know if anything else is good, because we went in for the Cremia ice cream!  It was also one of the cheapest, clocking in at around ¥600.  The hype is real, the Cremia was so rich and creamy, just miles above anything you’d find in the US and the cone was tasty as well.  They have plenty of seating in the back.  If Costco could just carry tubs of these, that would be the DREAM.  They’d also sell out ASAP.  Note, not every Excelsior has them.  If a shop does carry Cremia, they usually had a sign out front, so keep your eyes peeled when you’re walking around!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Kyoto Activities&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/NqP67KJ\"&gt;Nijo Castle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty neat castle, the castle grounds are pretty enormous.  Pretty historic, as the last Tokugawa shogunate announced handing over power back to the Emperor at Ninomaru Palace.  Plenty of signage in English that explains things.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marukyu Koyamaen - Nishinotoin&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fairly close to Nijo Castle, one of the popular matcha brands.  They do enforce a limit, and explicitly mention which matchas are not to be used in lattes.  They also have a cafe here.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/tL7N9cN\"&gt;Nishiki Tenmangu Shrine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Shrine to the god of scholarship/learning.  Established in 1003, but moved to its current location near Nishiki Market in 1587 (crazy how old some of these are!).  Very convenient shrine to go to if your itinerary is light on shrines.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/533Jb5G\"&gt;MOCOMOCO Arashiyama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Kimono rental.  Opened slightly earlier than other shops at 8:45 instead of 9.  Decent selection, price was okay.  I would check your kimono for any stains since mine had some, but they provided a haori for free to cover it up.  Only 1 person to help the guys, but it’s fairly quick, less than 15 minutes.  The women go upstairs and there’s ~6 staff upstairs, maybe 45-60 min.  Most of the staff are Chinese (moved here 10-20 years ago).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/oYrKQAD\"&gt;Daikaku-ji&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Excellent temple, very very few people here.  They have a great bamboo grove, much better than Arashiyama’s (if you want your photos).  There’s a man-made lake.  Slightly out of the way, so you have to take a bus here (which was not on time at all, when we wanted to go to Tenryu-ji).  Why’d we go?  I proposed to my GF here, and the photographer recommended it.  It turned out to be a fantastic choice (we also saw two other couples taking what seemed to be engagement photos here as the men were in hakama.  Lots of picturesque backdrops for photos to remember Japan by.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tenryu-ji&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A UNESCO World Heritage Site, we were mainly here for its restaurant, Shigetsu.  We didn’t go inside any other structures, but the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/hK2vNgt\"&gt;outside garden&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Garden of a Hundred Flowers, is quite beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/EdUf14t\"&gt;Arashiyama Bamboo Forest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The famous bamboo forest you’ll see on social media.  Very close to Tenryu-ji, so you might as well check it out if you’re already in the area.  Yes it’s crowded, but not shoulder-to-shoulder.  Don’t expect to get any photos with no one else in the background.  For us, Daikaku-ji was excellent for that shot.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arashiyama Miffy Sakura Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Good for the Miffy fans, there’s also a separate bakery here as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kimono Forest&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Neat art installation that ends up being a good background for photos, especially if you’re already in a kimono.  It is lit up a night, worth checking out since it&amp;#39;s part of the Randen tram station.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Platz&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We stumbled across this local shop.  Established around 1890, they sell homegoods and their own handmade cushions/futons.  Owner speaks excellent English.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/sppTCrN\"&gt;Fushimi Inari Taisha&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We went here at 8am, it wasn’t too crowded.  Maybe only had to wait less than one minute, cumulatively, to allow people to take their photos.  Since I didn’t go past the ‘crossroads’ last year, we decided to climb up to the summit, e.g. Kami-no-Yashiro shrine.  Having experienced it now, I would say ‘summit’ it if you enjoy hiking or want to check it off, otherwise reaching the crossroads is 95% of the Fushimi Inari experience.  For that extra 5%, you spent an extra 30-45 minutes (and, importantly, feet stamina!) that could be spent exploring something new, just my two cents.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Miel Mie&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Specialty honey store, with a cafe as well.  They have a slew of single origin honey, both domestic and international, some of the varieties include sakura, coffee, blueberry, lavender, almond, etc.  Super cool for honey fans;  I bought a 3-pack for a honey connoisseur friend.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOBICHI Kyoto&lt;/strong&gt; - 3.5/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of two official Hobonichi stores.  Excellent gifts for those who like stationary.  They have collaborations with artists, as well as pop culture like One Piece and Junji Ito.  I rated this as a casual non-stationary person, but for those invested in the Hobonichi system like my GF, this is definitely a 5/5.  She spent quite a lot here, especially since they got rid of the free shipping when buying online.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/LUBfLz6\"&gt;Kinkaku-ji&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The famous golden pavilion.  Definitely a must for a first-timer.  There’s not much else here, and a bit out of the way, though if you have the time, you can check out Ryoan-ji nearby&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/4m6kUHH\"&gt;Kiyomizu-dera&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Probably the most famous temple in Kyoto.  You likely will have to make the trek uphill to the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/P3zU6S4\"&gt;entrance&lt;/a&gt;.  There’s a bit to see &amp;amp; do (if partaking in temple activity).  Not too crowded in terms of moving around, but the photo spots are quite crowded.  There is a bit of a wait for the goshuin here.  Excellent &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/1yCMiIR\"&gt;foliage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asahido Honten&lt;/strong&gt; - 3.5/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Ceramics and other home goods.  Established right outside Kiyomizu-dera in 1870.  There seems to be 3 stores in the vicinity, each a different focus.  The closest one had the super expensive, traditional stuff.  Another had a more modern aesthetic.  If you’re big on ceramics, definitely check this out.  I picked up some nice hammered spoons here.  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shogoin Yatsuhashi&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A confectionary shop we passed by that sold yatsuhashi, the souvenir snacks that you’ll see around Kyoto (mochi-like triangles with a filling in the center).  It’s pretty cheap, though it doesn’t seem like it would hold up well when travelling, expiration for the soft kind seems to be 1-2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yoroshi Cosmetics&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Seems to be a pretty new brand.  It drew a good number of customers (including us) because of its wall of hand creams tins, with a design for &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/KvAQTwS\"&gt;each day of the year&lt;/a&gt;.  They’re all the same fragrance, but they have other products (balms, bathbombs, etc) and other fragrances as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Itoh Kyuemon Shimizu Sanneizaka&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Somewhat well-known matcha brand.  I’ve definitely seen their name on the special matcha- and hojicha-flavored KitKats.  Their stuff was noticeably more expensive than ones like Marukyu Koyamaen and Ippodo.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John&amp;#39;s Blend Kyoto&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 (GF’s)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;You can create your own fragrance sachet by choosing among musk, kimono fabric, drawstring, and charms.  Fun experience and lasting fragrance per the GF.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wargo (Ninenzaka)&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A hairpin chain that I also noticed at Nishiki Market and in Tokyo.  Lots of modern designs.  If getting it as a souvenir, they also sell a neat box with various designs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Donguri Kyowakoku&lt;/strong&gt; - 3.5/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An official Studio Ghibli merchandise store/chain.  Selection was decent and on-par, if not better than, the merch area inside Ghibli Museum.  A little pricey, but you&amp;#39;re getting official merch, and it&amp;#39;s pretty much in line with prices at other shops like Pokemon Center or Jump Shop, so temper expectations accordingly. There&amp;#39;s a giant Totoro right when you walk in and with some room to take a picture with it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Washikurabu Kodaijiten&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 (GF’s)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Local, small business.  Per the GF, a lot of washi paper others didn’t have, very cute, caution: bad English&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;Kyoto Food&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okakidokoro Terakoyahonpo Nishikiichiba Sohonten&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.07&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Traditional senbei (rice cracker) shop located in Nishiki Market.  We passed by and decided to try it.  There’s a few flavors to choose from, worth a shot if you want to try freshly made senbei.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/8Da28eV\"&gt;Hikiniku to Kome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 4.5/5 - Tabelog 3.53&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the most hyped restaurants on Instagram. The &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/GZnnvnF\"&gt;morning line&lt;/a&gt; to get a dinner reservation for later that evening was quite long. We got there right at 9am when they would start processing people in line, and there were ~20 in front of us, and lots more as time passed. It went quickly as the person takes your name and tells you the available slots.  The latest time we could get was 5:45pm, so if you want a later time, definitely show up early in the morning.  You get 3 hamburg steaks and they give you a paper that explains how they recommend you eat them: by itself, with grated radish and ponzu, and with raw egg. My favorite was with the ponzu. There&amp;#39;s also PLENTY of condiments to have it exactly how you like it. Each one is quite juicy, and goes amazing over rice.  Staff are friendly and helpful.  My first one was fairly raw in the middle, so they made a new one, no questions asked.  You can have as much rice as you&amp;#39;d like, and the rice is very good!  Was it worth it? Hamburg steak isn&amp;#39;t revolutionary, it&amp;#39;s gonna taste pretty good if you grill it. I think where Hikiniku shines is providing the full spread of condiments (the homemade ponzu!!!) so you can &amp;#39;mix-and-match&amp;#39; to really enjoy your - if we&amp;#39;re being honest - meatballs. If you&amp;#39;re hungry, I highly recommend getting an extra one.  Price is quite fair, I would&amp;#39;ve thought it would be priced higher given how many foreigners come, but you&amp;#39;re paying just $12 for this experience.  We opted not to reserve in advance via Tablecheck for a hefty fee, and whose reservation system is total trash. I tried the &amp;#39;free&amp;#39; one a week in advance, and it never really opened up. So again, recommend waiting early in the morning if you don&amp;#39;t want to pay a fee.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shigetsu&lt;/strong&gt; - 5/5 - Tabelog 3.57 - Michelin Bib Gourmand and Green Star&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the few places to get shojin ryori (Japanese Buddhist cuisine), and on the grounds of Tenryu-ji.  You can choose between 3 courses, and the price range is actually quite large, from ¥3800 to ¥6500 to ¥9000.  I went for the most expensive one as when would you get another chance to try shojin ryori? Though I think the other two would be pretty good as well!  The spread of food was quite amazing and quite tasty.  If you&amp;#39;re complaining about the lack of veggies in your food during your trip, shojin ryori definitely has you covered: mushrooms, soybean, even bamboo, and a few others we couldn&amp;#39;t quite identify.  When the food started trickling in, it was actually &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/SksYTUs\"&gt;overwhelming&lt;/a&gt;.  A bowl of matcha as well! The persimmon was quite ripe and gigantic.  Note, you will have to sit on tatami mats, and eat from a tatami table. Our room was quite spacious, and only 1 other couple was with us.  Recommended to reserve this in advance as they will likely sell out (they had a sign saying so during our visit, and I saw a few come by disappointed).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;% ARABICA Kyoto Arashiyama&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.58&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Decent coffee per the GF, but fairly long line.  After your order, then you’ll be waiting for them to make your drink (surprise, there’s a backlog).  No seating inside, but you can pay for a reserved room.  At least you can enjoy your drink outside with the riverview.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unagi Hirokawa&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.69&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Found it as it was the highest-rated unagi/unadon restaurant in the Arahsiyama area.  Reservations required, and a ¥3000 deposit per person that is applied against your total.  Highly recommend getting either the B course or C course (if you&amp;#39;re really hungry).  The unagi yubamaki (eel in tofu skin) is excellent.  The main course is the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/DqMs3Ie\"&gt;glazed grilled eel over rice&lt;/a&gt;, quite decadent.  The only nitpick would be if the eel had a bit more of that char.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Honke Owariya&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.49&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The oldest restaurant in Kyoto, and one of the oldest in Japan/the world.  They’ve been on this spot since 1465, first as a confectionary shop then switched when soba became popular for monks.  Highly recommend getting either of the two specials, the Nishin Soba Set, a hot soba focused on fish, or the Hourai, a cold soba where you &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/0hEZOmk\"&gt;mix-and-match 8 toppings&lt;/a&gt;.  Be sure to order the rikyu-fu, which is sweet, fried wheat gluten topped with grated radish and covered in ponzu sauce.  Okay, let&amp;#39;s talk about the line: CRAZY.  We &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/wrwy75x\"&gt;waited 2 hours&lt;/a&gt;, from when we got there right at 11am, and sat down just before 1pm.  What’s ironic is I made fun of my GF for picking places to go to based on Instagram since they would likely have long lines, but I chose this spot, which had the longest line of them all...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEEKENDERS COFFEE Tomikoji&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.53&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Good coffee per the GF.  Fast service, but not a good spot to hang out.  People were sitting on the railing.  Luckily the very nice bench they had opened up and we snatched it up.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tenjaku&lt;/strong&gt; - 4.5/5 - Tabelog 3.66 - Michelin 1 Star&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Chef Ryo Nishioka took over his grandfather&amp;#39;s business and has made tempura a key element of his kaiseki offering.  The &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/ivSFFhg\"&gt;hassun&lt;/a&gt; (a little bit of everything) is his selection of small, seasonal appetizers.  Very beautifully crafted, both composition in and taste. Very seafood-forward, no land animals that I can remember: barracuda, amadai, shrimp, Spanish mackerel, crab, clam. His tempura is at the level of other Michelin-starred tempura shops.  Only 1 seating a night, an 8-person hinoki wood counter, and two others helping him. It&amp;#39;s quite an intimate experience. He engages with the guests, answering questions as well as asking us some in return. He&amp;#39;s quite kind and makes jokes, it almost feels like a dinner party.  He changes his menu and his ceramics 12 times a year.  He noticed I was left-handed and made changes accordingly, great eye for details.  Easy to reserve via PocketConcierge, no fee unlike tableall... His pricing is quite fair given the quality of food, intimate atmosphere, and especially compared to other Michelin-level offerings at dinner time. It is a bit far from the other spots tourists come to Kyoto for, but I think that makes this restaurant more of a hidden gem (though I don&amp;#39;t believe our counter had any locals).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takinoya&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.29&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A small shop in Kiyomizu-dera right next to the ‘waterfall’, hence the name translates to “Waterfall House”.  We passed by and stopped for the amazake, note this one is more traditional and has ginger.  They have udon, tofu, and other desserts.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KUMONOCHA Kiyomizu Sannenzaka&lt;/strong&gt; - 4.5/5 (GF’s) - Tabelog 3.41&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;GF found on Instagram, specifically the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/ygdCDjm\"&gt;kumo no mousse&lt;/a&gt;, which is cloud-shaped, filled with red bean, and comes with a matcha.  She liked the set and the taste.  Only downside is they don’t give you too much matcha, and the milk came with too much ice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bunnosuke Chaya Kyoto&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.14&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Passed by and the GF saw they had a collab with Haikyu!!, so we got one of their &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/7F8lt4i\"&gt;warabi mochi soft serves&lt;/a&gt;, which came with a character acrylic.  They had a cafe area, but this item was take-out only.  Lots of Japanese girls here for the collab.  Established in 1909, there’s lots of other desserts that looked to be worth trying.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kyo Tsukemono Mori Yasaka&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5 - Tabelog 3.02&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just outside of Yasaka, we passed by this onigiri shop, with a focus on &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/gvwxLK3\"&gt;tsukemono (Japanese pickles) as the filling&lt;/a&gt;.  We got the traditional wild Kyoto vegetables, small dried sardines with Japanese pepper, and grilled soy sauce &amp;amp; corn butter ones.  The corn one was meh, but the wild vegetables one was great.  Seating was a little difficult, seemed to be mainly Japanese customers.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/AV1grF4\"&gt;Yoshinosushi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - 3/5 - Tabelog 3.22&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Local sushiya near the Pontocho area, found via Reddit recommendation.  Fairly small inside with a mix of locals and tourists.  Lots of fish to choose from, and he was able to make toru-taku, which was not on the menu.  Prices were cheap (though not Sushiro-cheap), and there was a sign outside that said it was 10% off that day.  Overall, the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/Gx15320\"&gt;fish wasn’t bad&lt;/a&gt;, but wasn’t the high quality we were expecting being in Japan, it was fairly comparable to the mid-tier sushi places back home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shunsai Imari&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/U5koyAU\"&gt;Obanzai (Kyoto-style) breakfast&lt;/a&gt;. Japanese comfort food. Very affordable and filling breakfast to start the day (if you&amp;#39;re sick of having konbini food). There are limited seats and they do get booked fairly quickly. Plenty of seats available when reservations opened for the month 2 months before (e.g. September 1 for November).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nakamura Tokichi - Kyoto Station&lt;/strong&gt; - 4/5&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well known matcha brand that has a store with a restaurant at Kyoto station.  They have a subset of the menu items that I saw at the original location in Uji.  I ordered the &lt;a href=\"https://imgur.com/b3cDkiN\"&gt;hot seasonal matcha buckwheat noodles with chicken, combo-ed with the tea jelly dessert&lt;/a&gt;.  Worth the visit if you need to grab a meal before your train to the next city.  You can also buy the matcha jelly/pudding in a to-go container.  Don’t forget to buy some tea as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1pwzcm9/14_days_in_nov_2025_118_places_to_see_eat_at_in/\"&gt;Part 2 here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

          "selftext": "I (F25) work as the manager of an art studio, although “manager” might be too romanticized a term for all the things I do there. I teach painting classes for adults (technically the only class I’m meant to give) and kids (I’m meant to only supervise, but for one reason or another I’ll get to, I always end up teaching them as well). I also offer guided ceramic sessions, prepare coffee for said sessions, clean everything in the studio after its usage (yes, even the restroom), restock materials, and come in whenever one of the kids’ teachers is absent.\nNone of those tasks are particularly weird for an art studio. Things get messy and cleanliness is important. However, I wouldn’t necessarily say all of these things are meant to fall under the manager’s job description.\nAt the beginning of my position, I loved my job. It was a dream come true for a college art student, and I worked my butt off to get it. I used to be one of the kids’ teachers and volunteered whenever I could because I genuinely loved the work. The pay was barely above minimum wage, but my coworkers and I did it for the love of art and the flexibility of the hours.\nWhen my boss Jessica (F27) offered me the manager position, I was ecstatic. She was leaving to pursue her master’s degree in a foreign country and needed someone to take care of the studio she built from the ground up. After a month of training and two more months of supervision to make sure I did everything correctly, she left to study abroad. Things were really good for almost a year.\nThat’s when my boss’s mom (50s), who I’ll call Karen, started coming into the studio more frequently.\nI want to add some context here. I’ve been a teacher since I was 19. I’ve taught everything from online classes to private schools. I know how to do my job. I’ve been painting since I was four years old and am proficient in pretty much any traditional art medium you can think of.\nKaren does not have that type of background. She’s an accountant by trade and was originally only meant to handle the finances of the studio. However, according to both her and my boss, she is also “the eyes of my boss in the studio.”\nAt first, her involvement wasn’t an issue. She’d report things that were missing or repairs that could be made. Our relationship was good. I even designed her kitchen when she bought a new home (she paid me about $100, yes, I know that’s very low, but I asked for that amount). I also dogsat and walked their dogs when they traveled. I’m actually writing this while returning from their house because they asked me to dogsit again over the holidays. Not exactly the most ideal Christmas Eve.\nFor the past several months, I’ve been slowly wanting to quit, mainly because of Karen, but also because of how closely my boss follows her lead. Here are some of the things that have contributed to my burnout:\n\n- Karen eliminated paid training sessions for teachers and required them to take studio classes out of their own pocket. A month costs about $70, which isn’t cheap where I’m from. Teachers were paid $20 per class, four classes a month. It wasn’t until I pointed out that the math wasn’t mathing that my boss reduced it to 50%. When teachers still wouldn’t come, they eventually made it free.\n- I used to stay a couple of hours after my shift because I loved the job. My boss gently told me to stop, and I did. One time I stayed an hour late, Karen saw me through the Ring camera and coldly told me to leave. The next day, my day off, Jessica messaged me saying she would deduct an hour from my salary for using studio resources like lights and A/C. After a panic attack and talking to my lawyer bestie, I informed her that this was illegal. She later admitted she didn’t know.\n- Karen micromanages every cleanliness detail and reports things, like an unclean sink, to my boss instead of just telling me directly.\n- For over a year, I wasn’t registered for insurance or social security, despite that being legally required where I live. When they finally did it, they treated it as my yearly raise.\n- They’ve said next year they’ll reduce my workload without reducing my salary, which I strongly suspect is their justification for not giving me a raise again.\nKaren micromanages how I teach. How much time I spend with kids, which techniques I use, and whether students should change methods regardless of my professional opinion.\n\nBut the breaking point happened during my vacation.\nMy last working day was December 20th. Karen checked everything one last time, I turned everything off, and I was ready to enjoy two weeks of doing absolutely nothing. The next day, a Sunday, Karen messaged me asking for a $40 craft store receipt I hadn’t sent to the group chat. I told her I thought I had thrown it away (my bad, it was the first time this happened), but that the purchase had been invoiced to my boss’s email, which turned out to be outdated.\nThe next day, Jessica asked for a meeting. She reviewed a few contract points, then told me I needed to go back to the store to retrieve the receipt, send a package to a client, and walk her dogs since Karen and her family were visiting her for Christmas.\nI was tired as fuck and just wanted to rest, but I complied. The craft store told me they couldn’t reprint the receipt without the original ticket. Dead end.\nOn December 23rd, the day before Christmas Eve, Karen sent a message saying that company policy was that any receipt not shown would be absorbed by the employee.\nThe implication was clear. That I had bought unnecessary items or was hiding something. I immediately felt sick. I was nauseous, shaking, and anxious all day. An accountant friend told me that the invoice could easily be checked through the tax platform. A lawyer friend confirmed they couldn’t legally withhold my pay and recommended I quit.\nAfter all this, I’m drained. I always knew I was watering a garden that wasn’t mine, but I poured so much love into that place. I’m done being micromanaged and made to feel incompetent when I know the studio functioned largely because I was there.\nThe emotional whiplash is real. Being called one of Jessica’s best friends one day, then having her mom threaten to charge me for a missing receipt the next. Being asked to walk the dogs and then barely being acknowledged at the door.\n\nI feel bad for the consequences of what my leaving would entail. A lot of the students there have told me they're only there because I am the teacher (where I'm from, these classes are not cheap). I have worked hard to develop a good working relationship with my students and other clients. And Karen and Jessica's lack of trust is frankly insulting. The petty part of me hopes to see how the studio will struggle after my absence to prove I was important, but the majority of me feels shitty for even considering to leave right after I had my holiday. I've been debating if I should stay for one month more or just 15 days. Should I offer to train my replacement or should I leave them to do that themselves? I'm asking for honest advice to navigate this situation without burning too many bridges. Also, I'm having a hard time pin pointing what exactly my employers did wrong, so if anyone can help me put a name to the behavior I'd appreciate it. \n",

I even designed her kitchen when she bought a new home (she paid me about $100, yes, I know that’s very low, but I asked for that amount). I also dogsat and walked their dogs when they traveled. I’m actually writing this while returning from their house because they asked me to dogsit again over the holidays. Not exactly the most ideal Christmas Eve.\nFor the past several months, I’ve been slowly wanting to quit, mainly because of Karen, but also because of how closely my boss follows her lead. Here are some of the things that have contributed to my burnout:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Karen eliminated paid training sessions for teachers and required them to take studio classes out of their own pocket. A month costs about $70, which isn’t cheap where I’m from. Teachers were paid $20 per class, four classes a month. It wasn’t until I pointed out that the math wasn’t mathing that my boss reduced it to 50%. When teachers still wouldn’t come, they eventually made it free.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I used to stay a couple of hours after my shift because I loved the job. My boss gently told me to stop, and I did. One time I stayed an hour late, Karen saw me through the Ring camera and coldly told me to leave. The next day, my day off, Jessica messaged me saying she would deduct an hour from my salary for using studio resources like lights and A/C. After a panic attack and talking to my lawyer bestie, I informed her that this was illegal. She later admitted she didn’t know.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Karen micromanages every cleanliness detail and reports things, like an unclean sink, to my boss instead of just telling me directly.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;For over a year, I wasn’t registered for insurance or social security, despite that being legally required where I live. When they finally did it, they treated it as my yearly raise.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;They’ve said next year they’ll reduce my workload without reducing my salary, which I strongly suspect is their justification for not giving me a raise again.\nKaren micromanages how I teach. How much time I spend with kids, which techniques I use, and whether students should change methods regardless of my professional opinion.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But the breaking point happened during my vacation.\nMy last working day was December 20th. Karen checked everything one last time, I turned everything off, and I was ready to enjoy two weeks of doing absolutely nothing. The next day, a Sunday, Karen messaged me asking for a $40 craft store receipt I hadn’t sent to the group chat. I told her I thought I had thrown it away (my bad, it was the first time this happened), but that the purchase had been invoiced to my boss’s email, which turned out to be outdated.\nThe next day, Jessica asked for a meeting. She reviewed a few contract points, then told me I needed to go back to the store to retrieve the receipt, send a package to a client, and walk her dogs since Karen and her family were visiting her for Christmas.\nI was tired as fuck and just wanted to rest, but I complied. The craft store told me they couldn’t reprint the receipt without the original ticket. Dead end.\nOn December 23rd, the day before Christmas Eve, Karen sent a message saying that company policy was that any receipt not shown would be absorbed by the employee.\nThe implication was clear. That I had bought unnecessary items or was hiding something. I immediately felt sick. I was nauseous, shaking, and anxious all day. An accountant friend told me that the invoice could easily be checked through the tax platform. A lawyer friend confirmed they couldn’t legally withhold my pay and recommended I quit.\nAfter all this, I’m drained. I always knew I was watering a garden that wasn’t mine, but I poured so much love into that place. I’m done being micromanaged and made to feel incompetent when I know the studio functioned largely because I was there.\nThe emotional whiplash is real. Being called one of Jessica’s best friends one day, then having her mom threaten to charge me for a missing receipt the next. Being asked to walk the dogs and then barely being acknowledged at the door.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I feel bad for the consequences of what my leaving would entail. A lot of the students there have told me they&amp;#39;re only there because I am the teacher (where I&amp;#39;m from, these classes are not cheap). I have worked hard to develop a good working relationship with my students and other clients. And Karen and Jessica&amp;#39;s lack of trust is frankly insulting. The petty part of me hopes to see how the studio will struggle after my absence to prove I was important, but the majority of me feels shitty for even considering to leave right after I had my holiday. I&amp;#39;ve been debating if I should stay for one month more or just 15 days. Should I offer to train my replacement or should I leave them to do that themselves? I&amp;#39;m asking for honest advice to navigate this situation without burning too many bridges. Also, I&amp;#39;m having a hard time pin pointing what exactly my employers did wrong, so if anyone can help me put a name to the behavior I&amp;#39;d appreciate it. &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

And that I may need to narrow my scope. I had this business pipe dream back in my mid 20s and shelved it to be a k-12 ceramic teacher to have my student loans forgiven. I'm close to 10 years but at this point I just don't care anymore. I need out of this job. And I just want to chase my dream. I had so many people tell me this doesn't work from other studios in other states or cities. But Im just like then how are you open? I think my business for my community could work. There isn't anything like it here in my city. I believe there's a big market for it. But I don't want to start off too big or too small. So there's my idea.\n\nMy mission is to provide a public ceramic studio and shop where community members can engage through multiple blah blah blahs. I want to sell supplies, materials, tools for locals that have their own studios at home and those in the studio. I want to provide introductory and other-level classes people can sign up to take. I also want to start youth classes. I had an idea to start my own non profit separate from my business to offer “scholarships” for those that can't afford a class to be able to take them for free. But idk how all that would work out. (I really just want my student loans forgiven haha ((i know its not that simple and not how it works but I can have my pipe dream))) but I also just really love kids. And if I didn't have a youth program I think I'd missing my k-12 position. I just love getting involved with them and inspiring their creative young minds. I'd like to do one night class craft activities and business team building activities. I want to provide studio access and rented space. Kind of like a “gym” I guess. You pay a monthly fee to access facility. Multiple membership teira either include access to things like in-house glazes and firings or you can pay for those separately. I want to provide firing services for people not a part of the studio. And I'd like to have the ability to showcase studio members artwork for sale and commission.\n\nAll of this requires a lot of expensive equipment and furniture. I already have a location in mind that's close to the interstate near state line. So I'm snagging people from my GA city community and other city in SC. Getting money to start this gives me panic attacks. Because if I put my house up as collateral and fail I'd loose everything. I can't lose my house I bought it when I was 19 and it's my baby.\n\nOn top of all this I already own my own pottery business third eye ceramics. It's taken to the shelf since teaching, but I'd still like to revitalize it and make online sales and such. I used to have a huge following and was really making some profit before teaching ate away at my life and soul.\n\nI'm not sure what kind of help I'm seeking so feel free to roast me for that one. But this has been my dream and I'm tired of people saying it can't work. I know it can. The community is out there waiting for this. I've spoken and worked with other half asses non-profits and for profit businesses in my area and they are just too small scale to provide the opportunities I want to offer.\n\nLike I said I gave up on this dream back in 2019 and there is a whole story of when I came so close and almost got conned out of money from people that pretended they wanted to be business partners. So I know I just need to do this on my own. It's just freaks me out doing something so big. But I also just feel this surge of fire and excitement. Y'all know that feeling.\n\nI know that writing a business plan can be complicated. I'm going to purchase some into books from local college store and also do a lot of work with SBA. And of course search like hell on this subreddit.\n\nAnyway, lmk your thoughts on my business idea. Is it too big of an idea to start with? Or should I go big to ensure I have a successful revenue?",

It was called Jensen's, but when I look up \"jensen's glaze\", \"jensen blue\", or anything similar, I can't find any recipes or places to buy it (at least how it used to look- I found it on [Aardvark](https://www.aardvarkclay.com/products.php?cat=112), but it seems like it's more brown/orange due to recipe changes). I also found one on [CeramicRecipes](https://ceramicartsnetwork.org/ceramic-recipes/recipe/Jensen-Blue-143821), but it's much darker/purple and just seems like a different glaze.\n\nI did find [this article](https://graysamba.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/the-many-faces-of-jensen-blue/) about it that seems like the same glaze, but it's pretty old and has no recipe/place to buy the glaze. I've also found some pretty similar glazes/recipes under the names [Arctic Blue](https://kruegerpottery.com/products/amaco-pc21), [Soft Blue](https://www.scarva.com/en/Spectrum-1522-Soft-Blue/m-4565.aspx), and [Rutile Blue](https://www.buymayco.com/PC-20-BLUE-RUTILE), but none were exactly the same and the websites had limited pictures. I also found some of these as recipes on Glazy, but again pictures were limited/inconsistent.\n\nIt's a light, pale blue that turns brown/transparent in thin spots, but is opaque when thicker. In thickest spots, it turns slightly purple. \n\nIf anyone knows where I can buy a similar glaze or has a recipe, please let me know! Thank you :\\^)\n\n[Two hand-built vases sporting Jensen, one lighter and one darker with more brown to showcase variation. This is more similar to the Arctic or Soft Blues that I found, but those lacked the brown spots.](https://preview.redd.it/7tzqhl9ai88g1.jpg?width=4000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f56dd0003a89534488e66de7d4e430c2aab5f53c)\n\n[Another Jensen vase, this time with a lot more purple showing \\(and dog hair, ha ha\\).](https://preview.redd.it/7iartp4vj88g1.jpg?width=1182&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52416c1e9d5a3553881a80dbd487b18d9cbb3b0e)\n\n[Another Jensen, this time a lot more vibrant blue.

It was called Jensen&amp;#39;s, but when I look up &amp;quot;jensen&amp;#39;s glaze&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;jensen blue&amp;quot;, or anything similar, I can&amp;#39;t find any recipes or places to buy it (at least how it used to look- I found it on &lt;a href=\"https://www.aardvarkclay.com/products.php?cat=112\"&gt;Aardvark&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems like it&amp;#39;s more brown/orange due to recipe changes). I also found one on &lt;a href=\"https://ceramicartsnetwork.org/ceramic-recipes/recipe/Jensen-Blue-143821\"&gt;CeramicRecipes&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;#39;s much darker/purple and just seems like a different glaze.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did find &lt;a href=\"https://graysamba.wordpress.com/2014/06/06/the-many-faces-of-jensen-blue/\"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; about it that seems like the same glaze, but it&amp;#39;s pretty old and has no recipe/place to buy the glaze. I&amp;#39;ve also found some pretty similar glazes/recipes under the names &lt;a href=\"https://kruegerpottery.com/products/amaco-pc21\"&gt;Arctic Blue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"https://www.scarva.com/en/Spectrum-1522-Soft-Blue/m-4565.aspx\"&gt;Soft Blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"https://www.buymayco.com/PC-20-BLUE-RUTILE\"&gt;Rutile Blue&lt;/a&gt;, but none were exactly the same and the websites had limited pictures. I also found some of these as recipes on Glazy, but again pictures were limited/inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a light, pale blue that turns brown/transparent in thin spots, but is opaque when thicker. In thickest spots, it turns slightly purple. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If anyone knows where I can buy a similar glaze or has a recipe, please let me know! Thank you :^)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7tzqhl9ai88g1.jpg?width=4000&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=f56dd0003a89534488e66de7d4e430c2aab5f53c\"&gt;Two hand-built vases sporting Jensen, one lighter and one darker with more brown to showcase variation. This is more similar to the Arctic or Soft Blues that I found, but those lacked the brown spots.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/7iartp4vj88g1.jpg?width=1182&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=52416c1e9d5a3553881a80dbd487b18d9cbb3b0e\"&gt;Another Jensen vase, this time with a lot more purple showing (and dog hair, ha ha).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/s33xu1sxj88g1.png?width=463&amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=5066b7748117b0998bd4417616cdde8cb192275f\"&gt;Another Jensen, this time a lot more vibrant blue. This is most similar to the Rutile Blues that I found.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TLDR: I can&amp;#39;t find an exact match to the glaze in the pictures, please help!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The ceiling and walls will be **white-painted wood**, with a concrete floor.\n\nThe odd circular/triangular shapes in the plan are potter’s wheels. There will be a kiln room in the back corner, work tables in the center, and shelving along one wall.\n\nWe’re aiming for **very even, bright ambient light** across the whole space to minimize shadows for wheel work and teaching. Because the ceiling is low, I’m wondering whether a solution with **significant uplight / ceiling wash** (direct-indirect or indirect-dominant) might help the space feel less compressed and create more visual volume.\n\nI’m having trouble finding anything off-the-shelf that really prioritizes uplight in a low-ceiling, workshop-type environment. Is this a reasonable approach, or am I overthinking it?\n\nThe obvious alternatives seem to be:\n\n* Standard linear “shop” lights (good coverage, but mostly downlight and can visually lower the ceiling)\n* Recessed/wafer lighting (clean, but we only have \\~2\" above the ceiling finish due to construction)\n\nI’m thinking more along the lines of workshop / industrial lighting strategies (even, diffuse, low shadow) rather than decorative fixtures — but with a warm, community studio feel. Or should I be thinking about this totally differently?\n\nI’m a contractor (mostly residential), not a lighting professional, but I care a lot about getting the spatial quality right. Any thoughts or examples, off-the-shelf or custom would be really appreciated. Thank you!",

          "selftext": "Did you ever hear the story of the Christmas Party Killer? It’s not the sort of story that people talk about in any devoted way. It’s not even something people take seriously. It sounds like one of those Christmas horror films. Only you will see not see this on the Hallmark channel, you won’t even see it in Fangoria magazine. This is a story more sinister, more tragic, more gruesome than anything you will see. And while these events are largely set around the Christmas period, this is not a Christmas story. \n\nOne year in mid December, a baby named Chuck Redman was born. His mother was actually supposed to have him January 1st. She said that it was no good because, as forward thinking as she was, having a child’s birthday on New Year’s Day would mean a whole life of not being able to do anything for New Year’s Eve, at least until he was 18. They suggested then, doing a c section, for a week earlier. Again, it was met with pushback from Mrs Redman, who now had a problem with him being born on Christmas. So they made one final suggestion, December 18, but that was the earliest they could possibly do. She agreed. What she didn’t realise was that this would cause a domino effect that would end in bloodshed. His father, Mr. Redman, missed the birth of course. He had his work Christmas party to go to. And when he got there, he was too busy trying to figure out if the hospital room TV could pick up the sports channel instead of witnessing the first moments of his only child. \n\nFrom there, Chuck grew up in a peculiar household. His parents were atheists so from a very early age they told him that there was no god, no Jesus, no Easter bunny, no tooth fairy, no Bermuda Triangle and certainly no Santa Claus. This was done for two reasons. The first being their very sound logic of *“why would we fill his head with illusions of an imaginary man in the sky watching down on him? Making sure he’s always good and never bad? When we don’t even believe our own adult version?”* The second reason they gave it to him straight about Christmas was because they didn’t want to spoil him. When Mrs Redman was pregnant with Chuck she saw a 60 minutes segment where some parents wanted to keep the trick alive by giving their children a present from themselves and a present from Santa. The idea was to make it seem like their children weren’t being overlooked. Mrs Redman couldn’t think of anything worse. So before he was born they decided that he only give him one present from each of them, on his birthday. \nThey even encouraged their extended family to do the same. They didn’t want the over indulgence and the lies turning their only child into a greedy schizophrenic brat with personality issues as he grew up. They let him watch the movies, decorate a tree, wrap presents, all the things that they felt to be socially acceptable so that they didn’t get any strange looks from their peers, all wondering what’s the deal with *that family.* \n\nFrom ages 8 to 11, Chuck was told that he wasn’t allowed to ruin other children’s delusions at school. But, rather than raising a liar by humouring the other kids, they told him that if the other kids ever brought it up to ignore them. And if the other kids asked him, to tell them that his family doesn’t believe in Christmas or Santa, that the other students at his school were well within their right to continue believing in all that, but it just wasn’t something his household entertained. He remembered this because he was told to say the same thing when the schools brought in religious education. When Chuck asked why he had to say it in this particular way and why he could just trll them that Santa wasn’t real, his mother explained to him. \n“Remember when your father told the Johnsons that there was no god and he nearly got his ass beat?” She asked rhetorically. \n“Yeah?” Chuck replied.\n“They were pretty mad that he was telling them that their belief was wrong. It didn’t matter if he was right, they didn’t like to hear him telling it. And that’s exactly how the kids and the parents of those kids will likely feel if you tell them about Christmas.” Despite being 10, Chuck understood this and did as he was told. \nHe was, however still teased. The other children rubbed it in his face that they all got two presents. But once they found out he didn’t believe in Santa Claus, they called him The Grinch. A fairly simple-minded tale made into a few less intelligent movie adaptations. The concept alone was preposterous to Chuck; a story about a person who hates Christmas is regarded as a Christmas staple? That’d be like calling Psycho a family film. Nevertheless, Norman Bates was a more welcome face in House Redman than Jim Carrey’s in any Grinch related entertainment. \n \nSpeaking of Psycho, because Chuck was able to identify and distinguish the difference between fantasy and reality at such a young age, he also started getting more into horror films. Mr and Mrs Redman justified that if nothing of the supernatural was tangibly real, then nothing could potentially scare him. And he took to them pretty well. Ghosts, goblins, vampires, werewolves, they were all fair game. Everything except serial killer movies, which Chuck had to steal from his dads personal stash or forge a note to blockbuster saying it was ok for him to rent out. He also watched a lot of professional wrestling. Despite the fact that his parents laid out the truth about everything fairly, his father had the curious belief that all WWE wrestling was real. Although “real” wouldn’t quite be the word. Chuck would tell him over and over that it was fake and his father would always correct him by saying “It’s not fake, it’s choreographed. There’s a difference.” As he tried to rack his little seven year old brain around what the word “choreographed” meant, his dad explained to him that while staged, pre rehearsed, planned out, there would be times where wrestlers would actually get hurt. This didn’t matter to Chuck though, because he still enjoyed wrestling all the same. Particularly the Christmas wrestling period, called “Season’s Beatings” which seemed to be the only other extra curricular Christmas activity he enjoyed with his father.\n\nOther than the wrestling, Chuck pretty much had free range of what he could watch during the festive season. His parents even encouraged it. Under one proviso. He could watch anything except traditional Christmas movies. More specifically, bad Christmas movies. Ones that Hollywood decided to make when they saw how much money could be beaten out of that dead reindeer. \nThe kind of slop where the studios thought *it’s not enough to release movie after movie all with the same basic plot points. We have to run it into the ground, with only a few different actors and slight variations of the same old Christmas pun titles to tell them apart.* Those feel good, kumbaya singing romance movies with shots that look like they’ve been pulled straight from a Christmas card and airing on a channel literally called Hallmark. Those ones where Ebenezer Scrooge has to go through a whole redemption arc purely because he treated people exactly how they treated him for his entire life. The Redmans saw this as corporate greed masquerading as pure sap to manipulate their audience into keeping their busiest season alive. And that they would continue to do this until the money would eventually run out and these companies, with their best intentions, would go back to making greeting cards that sell for $5 a pop.\n\nBut if that wasn’t enough, these types of films started invading other genres. Christmas comedies were popular, Christmas sci-fis were rare but they still happened, and maybe even the odd Mel Gibson film would throw its hat in the ring. But the second most popular Christmas hybrid down from comedy is horror, another thing that Chuck would regularly enjoy. “Gremlins”, “Jack Frost” (the slasher one), “Christmas Evil”, Black Christmas (even though it was a little boring) and, of course the “Silent Night, Deadly Night” films. Usually when he tried to invite the other kids in his class around for his birthday, most of them were too afraid to show up, and those that expressed interest were eventually told they weren’t allowed to because their family was leaving town that week for the holidays. So Chuck’s birthdays were very lonely for a good while. Almost to the point if routine. He went to dinner dinner with his extended family, had a cake afterwards, then went home to bed where he would watch a movie and pass out. Rinse and repeat. \n\nBut it wasn’t until high school where he actually found friends who truly appreciated his birthday and, more importantly, himself as a person. He got into a eclectic group of outsiders, a who’s who of “who cares” in the school. They were a ragtag bunch consisting of Parker, Harold, Rupert, Frank, Janey and Chuck. They loathed the idea of Christmas and even thought the concept of using organised religion, no matter which, as an excuse to spend time with people you don’t like once a year to be, in their words “a spastic concept.” These were the best years of Chuck’s life, because he finally saw people that were just like him. It wasn’t exactly a friendship deal breaker if they did celebrate Christmas, but it did make him feel less depressed. He was terrified of getting older and the thought of being alone for his birthday got worse and worse as he approached the end of his teens. \nJaney, being the only girl, was especially nice to him. He even developed a crush on her, but never made a move out of fear that either the other guys had the same intentions, or they would make fun of him because the thought of dating her would be like dating your sister. Chuck, being an only child, didn’t understand the feeling of that but he took Parker, the group roughian, at his word.\nIt was during his graduating year, where he felt truly himself. For his birthday he decided to do something on Christmas Eve. There  he invited the group over to his house where they all got drunk, had a couple of doobies, and went down to their local church to attend the midnight mass. Up to a hundred god botherers or otherwise tradition seeking men and women happened to find six jokers, in typical ill-behaved fashion, sitting in the back row, all wearing matching religious choir outfits and giggling away. It wasn’t until the hymn part of the ceremony where they were kicked out for singing in purposely annoying, over-the-top falsetto voices and then slapping their knees and each other as if it were feeding time in the monkey enclosure. When the reverend asked them to leave, Frank or Parker pointed to the ceramic baby Jesus and yelled “He sees you when you’re sleeping, you know!” before abruptly leaving. \nAfter this riotous affair, they walked down to a nearby playground, where they finished off the rest of their drinks. Wondering what they were going to do now that they’ve graduated. \n\nA couple months later came Harold’s birthday, in mid April. Harold, foolish arrogant Harold, always had to be mister attention and mother superior in the group. Chuck stressed to him over several arguments throughout the years that he couldn’t be both roles, he had to pick one so that he wouldn’t be called a tyrant. Harold didn’t care, if there was something he had to say, he was going to say it whether you liked it or not. He seemed unimpressed that Chuck wasn’t getting any employment, nor was he trying to seek further education by going to community college… at the very least. Chuck kept his cool throughout this ordeal, but he spent the whole time thinking “Youre a good friend Harold, but you’re a 60 year old in a 19 year old kid’s body. If I ever end up like you, I would end it.” So Chuck gritted his teeth, grinned and tolerated it for an hour, then finally discreetly said goodbye to Janey before leaving without notifying anyone else. That was the last time all of Chuck’s friends were in the same vicinity as each other.\n\nIt seemed so unexpected to Chuck. An inevitable fate that one cannot change. Like being in a train wreck and still travelling up to back despite every hauling you to your doom. Everyone just … drifted away from each other. It started off small, where one of them would get a casual job somewhere, and they wouldn’t see them for weeks, then another and another. Chuck kept in touch with everyone on social media but he just couldn’t get the band back together, but not for lack of trying. He tried organising something for his birthday every year. He saw it as an excuse to have a mini reunion. For that, he usually asked them, his family, friends of family. He even invited some of his co workers at the job his social worker scored for him, just a supermarket, nothing too crazy. \nAt first he tried to organise something on his actual birthday, to which most of the responses were a resounding no. They had their work Christmas parties to go to, they ran out of time, the holiday season has been so busy this year. Stuff like that. \nThen he started changing the date to New Year’s Eve, so that way it could be a double celebration, while also a way for them not to use the Christmas excuse. Again, most of his friends declined, reasoning that they spent *too much* money on Christmas and decided that, if they did something on new years, going out or catching up would be too overwhelming for them; they wanted to keep theirs lowkey. Some of them dropped off entirely. The only people that had legitimate excuses were his co workers who had to continue to go to work. His boss didn’t believe in having work Christmas parties, he thought they were a waste of time and money, something that Chuck couldn’t fault him for, and one of the only reasons he kept working there for as long as he did. \n\nWhat happened to hos friends, he thought. What happened to the guys he went to school who thought that Christmas was an outdated concept and it was better to be edgy. And now they had become the thing that laughed at. He was starting to get a little jealous of the holiday season. He stopped calling it Christmas years ago, it was now the holiday season for him. \nHere his friends were, telling him year after year that they had Christmas parties to go to. As if the mere act of not attending the non obligational work Christmas outing would result in them being fired. He spent days thinking about it every year. Working himself up and convincing himself that soulless companies are letting their employees brown nose them, that they imply that they would would make things very difficult for employees if they backed out of the sacred, precious Christmas party. Then Chuck started cursing god. He must’ve said to a 100 people over the years that “What this says to me is that if Jesus were a real person who is living and breathing today, my friends would rather go to *his* birthday party than to mine.” When he first exclaimed it, it was really just a joke… a funny but dry observation. But the more he kept saying it, the more conviction was heard in his voice. He just didn’t understand it… why do people spend months preparing for a one day event that will be over couple of hours in. Seemed like such a waste when there were more important things going on in the world. This is what he told himself. \n\nSeven years after the Harold party and Chuck was approaching two years at his work. Things were going fairly decently. He was acing his job, he had moved out of his parents home, he even felt less depressed about the way things were going. As long as he put the holidays out of his head. But then it happened. The manager had decided to put on Christmas songs on the store intercom radio. He couldn’t believe his ears. In September? Then he noticed Christmas ware l being brought out. When he approached his boss about why they had it all out so early, his boss gave him a very reasonable answer. All the other retail stores don’t put things up until October, and he wanted to get a jump on the sales stranglehold. When Chuck argued that he thought the boss didn’t celebrate Christmas, the boss countered this with it “doesn’t matter what I like. It’s what the customers like, and if you don’t like that, go somewhere else.” And for three straight months it was the same playlist of Christmas music, the same time every day. Chuck could’ve set his clock to when a certain song would come on any time of the day. This coupled with the blaring fluorescent lights shining down on him was a recipe for disaster. He was convinced that his boss was doing it to spite him, making it louder and quieter every day during graveyard hours when he knew Chuck was there. Chuck thought his miserable superior was doing it purely out of hatred towards Chuck for having the mere brass to question his power. And then one day, Chuck couldn’t believe it. It must’ve been a joke. The same Christmas song, stuck on a loop, repeating itself over and over for hours. Chuck was gobsmacked, astounded. He believed that his control hungry overlord had gone mad with power. Acting like some kind of religious leader, looking down on all of his worker monkeys. Watching the cashiers grinning like idiots while secretly paranoid that they’re going to get their hours cut if they take their fake deer antlers off. Chuck thought that this false deity who calls himself the checkout king was looking down at his loyal subjects, rewarding those who get with the program, and smiting those who resist. That song was meant to be on repeat, just to annoy him; and annoy him, it did. He had only gotten to the fourth hour into his shift before he snapped, decided that this wasn’t worth $20 an hour. So he took off all his work accessories, kicked over a few shelves, watching them scatter to the floor and walked out. It turned out that there was a glitch in the sound system, the boss wasn’t even there that day to fix the error. But that didn’t matter, the damage was already done and Chuck was fired. \n\nWith no job and facing eviction from his rental, Chuck faced the prospect of moving back in with his parents. Fortunately, he was still able to live at his current cheap, shabby love palace until after new years. So Chuck wanted to see how all of his friends were going, maybe to catch up for his birthday, one last hurrah while he had the place. He still had all the old gang on either Facebook or Snapchat, but he never really looked into what their life was now like. They all looked they were happy, thriving. He thought that maybe they had forgotten all about each other, maybe he wasn’t the only one that felt left in the cold. But it was then that he noticed. Janey, now important and respectable “Jane” had tagged people in her photos. Dinner pictures, vacation albums, holiday portraits, various posts that had one or more members in the friend group in attendance. There were even half a dozen photos over the seven years where all of them were together, in the same picture, attending the same event. Everybody except Chuck. So out of a mixture of fear and spite, instead of addressing it to any one of them, he created a Facebook event and a subsequent message group with the intent of catching up. \nThis took everyone by surprise. A mixture of confusion and fond memories. Harold, always the-holier-than-thou, left the group immediately. But that didn’t bother Chuck. His plan was to have everyone come over for beer, snacks and maybe pizza. Just like old times, but preferably without Harold sticking his rude head in and bringing the party down. Even if no one but Janey showed up would be fine by him. That could’ve been the most ideal situation. He just needed this to happen, without any form of holiday taking control of their decision. So he did everything he could to de-holiday his party, to not remind people of other obligations that didn’t involve him. He even triple checked the music to make sure nothing seasonal would come through. But sooner or later, Mariah Carey would creep in. That was a fact. It didn’t matter where he went, what he put on, she was following him. Waiting until the time was right to strike. And she would not stop. She was like a Christmas version of the terminator.\nAfter Harold, Rupert also dropped out early but at least he had the decency of making an excuse. No total loss, Chuck wasn’t overly fond of Rupert either. That left Parker, Frank and Janey swearing black and blue that they would go. \n\nBut Chuck’s big day arrived and with every passing hour after the designated time, he was sending more and more frantic messages. Not trying to make himself sound desperate, he sounded aloof about it, and one would think he was, were it not for the frequency of almost spam level messages. Chuck then looked to confirm the one thing that he’d been avoiding the whole night, confirming the one thing he was afraid of. He checked every single one of his friend’s stories and saw that everyone but Janey, posted videos of them at their work Christmas parties. Again, he had to hide his frustration with casualness. He messaged the group that if they still wanted something to do after their Christmas parties, he would still be around if they wanted to swing by. This blunt but contextually hostile message was taken to be a little bit overbearing for Parker and Frank, who were growing concerned that Chuck was keeping tabs on them. They both left the message group after seeing it. \nBy this point, Chuck was in such shock that all these people had done this to him that, to hell with them, he didn’t need them at all. He still had Janey coming. That’s right… Janey. Sweet, lovely, reliable Janey. That was when Janey messaged him privately, an hour later. \n\nShe hadn’t seen the chaos that happened in the group chat yet, because she told him that she couldn’t make it “but have fun and Merry Christmas.” She followed it up with the statement that she hoped that the others were there and could fill in for her. He knew she must’ve been telling the truth so he told her to check the message group. She did, and after that… he didn’t hear from her for the rest of the night. He didn’t know if this was a defence mechanism, fear of how she would be perceived if the other guys saw this, or if it was second hand embarrassment seeing how badly it all blew up. But she went cold. Leaving him to keep reading her private message, looking for clues. He kept re reading that last line. *”Have fun and Merry Christmas.”* Then it occurred to him. To confirm another thing that he really didn’t want to have to confirm. None of them wished him Happy Birthday, the very reason that they were going to catch up with him in the first place. Not a call, not a text, not even a social media post. He decided that this was the last straw. What was the point in living if everyone had forgotten who you are? So he decided he wasn’t going to keep on living, he would end it all. So he swallowed a bunch of pills, called an ambulance to say that he’d taken too many (just to give himself that slight chance of getting out of it) and waited by the phone until he slipped away into a beautiful godless nothing. An abyss of emptiness. Smiling, he passed out…\n\nTwo days later, he woke up. When he opened his eyes he saw that he was in a hospital room. An empty room with nothing but his clothes hanging on a rack, and something resting on the hospital table right beside him.\nFeeling like death and looking worse, Chuck buzzed a nurse in. She told him he was lucky. When he asked what she meant, she told him when they drove over to help him it was considered one of the least busy times during the holiday season in at least 20 years. They were hitting every green light along the way. She told him that someone was looking out for him.\nThis was the last thing that Chuck wanted to hear. He spent his whole life as a passionate atheist, and only when he’s on the precipice of death does God want to pull the rug out from under him? According to Chuck, nobody saved his life; they merely prevented his death. \n\nHe didn’t want to argue with the nurse so he smiled politely and told her he was going to get more sleep. When she left he seemed disappointed. He was expecting balloons, flowers, notes, giant bears, anything that told him that someone was worried about him. Before the botched attempt of his life, Chuck really truly did want to die. But a small part at the back of his mind thought *I hope they find about this!* Although he was surprised to discover he was still alive, he just couldn’t accept the fact that he wasn’t in anyone’s thoughts or prayers. There was nothing, just one card on a table. *Wait a minute,* he thought. Yes, the card. It was open with some of the best penmanship he’d ever seen, handwriting that he recognised. It was a card from Janey.\n“Dear Chuck,” it read. “I’m still trying to wrap my head around this as much as I can but I still don’t believe it. Give me a call when you wake up and we can talk. Only if you feel comfortable. You’re not alone in the world. - Jane”\nUnderneath she wrote, “Get well soon!” Chuck was touched. He felt this was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for him. A wash of emotion flooded him. This was short lived once he closed the card. For some odd reason in Chuck’s mind, he wanted to see what was on the front of the card. And when he closed it, he could already feel his hands getting tense. What he saw on the card was a picture of Santa Claus flying his sleigh over a street of houses. It wasn’t a birthday card, it wasn’t a get well soon card, it was a Christmas card. As his eyes tensed on this card, his hands curled up into balls as he felt the cards crunching into his hands, crudely compressing as his arms were shaking with pure rage. Eventually he let go and the card fell to the floor. The one person he thought gave a shit about him made no effort this time; the most important time. What would’ve been, were it not for his failed life attempt, his last time. Suddenly depression turned to rage, desparate emptiness to burning wrath. He decided that he would no longer sit by and watch his friends walk all over him. He decided something must be done. He turned over in bed where he fell silent. He didn’t talk again for three weeks.\n\nBecause of his scare that landed him in hospital, Chuck’s parents decided that it would be best if he were put into a mental health resort. This, to Chuck, was just a fancy term for a minimum security institution. He stayed there for a few months saying very little, watching the wrestling, and planning out what he was going to do. This time next year, he was going to kill all of his friends. He kept that one to himself though, because it seemed obvious to him that saying his plans out loud quote unquote “causes concern”. But they were his plans nonetheless. He deemed it was only fitting… being around Christmas a punishing the bad. So set out to follow them for a whole year… to to see if they were being naughty or nice. As Chuck began researching for this dreadful holiday, or what he called “knowing thy enemy” he found that more kids got punished in the 19th and 20th centuries. It wasn’t enough that a kid learnt his lesson in not being a little ass on Christmas, Santa wanted him to feel in every bone why he made a very bad choice. And some of the methods were extreme beyond all measures. Chuck was beginning to like this aspect of Christmas lore. It seemed to him, these days, that kids were more spoilt than ever. There were weak willed parents out there giving in to their kids’ every demand, either because they were too much of a soft touch that these brats exploited or they just caved into submission just to make them shut up. Whatever happened to punishment? Whatever happened to karma? And it wasn’t just kids either. Every single one of Chuck’s friends did him dirty. Even Janey. So they all needed to be punished. \n\nBut not Janey. No. He couldn’t bring himself to get her… but at the same time he could show all this to her, to make her learn the consequences of one’s actions. Suddenly it was all making sense to him now. Why he liked Christmas horror, why he liked WWE’s Season’s Beatings. It spoke to him, this voice. It told him that there sick degenerates out there treating people unfairly and thinking they can get away with it. Who? *Work Christmas Parties.* Of course. It was obvious to Chuck. As long as these damn things existed it will never stop for him. This was his villainous challenger. Like every \nWWE show there was always an over the top corporation they go after as a challenger, and Work Christmas Parties seemed like the perfect challenger arc.  *Who needs the Bible when you have that?* he thought as he prepared. *These are the things they should be teaching in school.* Punish the deserving, spare the innocent.\n",

          "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you ever hear the story of the Christmas Party Killer? It’s not the sort of story that people talk about in any devoted way. It’s not even something people take seriously. It sounds like one of those Christmas horror films. Only you will see not see this on the Hallmark channel, you won’t even see it in Fangoria magazine. This is a story more sinister, more tragic, more gruesome than anything you will see. And while these events are largely set around the Christmas period, this is not a Christmas story. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One year in mid December, a baby named Chuck Redman was born. His mother was actually supposed to have him January 1st. She said that it was no good because, as forward thinking as she was, having a child’s birthday on New Year’s Day would mean a whole life of not being able to do anything for New Year’s Eve, at least until he was 18. They suggested then, doing a c section, for a week earlier. Again, it was met with pushback from Mrs Redman, who now had a problem with him being born on Christmas. So they made one final suggestion, December 18, but that was the earliest they could possibly do. She agreed. What she didn’t realise was that this would cause a domino effect that would end in bloodshed. His father, Mr. Redman, missed the birth of course. He had his work Christmas party to go to. And when he got there, he was too busy trying to figure out if the hospital room TV could pick up the sports channel instead of witnessing the first moments of his only child. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From there, Chuck grew up in a peculiar household. His parents were atheists so from a very early age they told him that there was no god, no Jesus, no Easter bunny, no tooth fairy, no Bermuda Triangle and certainly no Santa Claus. This was done for two reasons. The first being their very sound logic of &lt;em&gt;“why would we fill his head with illusions of an imaginary man in the sky watching down on him? Making sure he’s always good and never bad? When we don’t even believe our own adult version?”&lt;/em&gt; The second reason they gave it to him straight about Christmas was because they didn’t want to spoil him. When Mrs Redman was pregnant with Chuck she saw a 60 minutes segment where some parents wanted to keep the trick alive by giving their children a present from themselves and a present from Santa. The idea was to make it seem like their children weren’t being overlooked. Mrs Redman couldn’t think of anything worse. So before he was born they decided that he only give him one present from each of them, on his birthday. \nThey even encouraged their extended family to do the same. They didn’t want the over indulgence and the lies turning their only child into a greedy schizophrenic brat with personality issues as he grew up. They let him watch the movies, decorate a tree, wrap presents, all the things that they felt to be socially acceptable so that they didn’t get any strange looks from their peers, all wondering what’s the deal with &lt;em&gt;that family.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;From ages 8 to 11, Chuck was told that he wasn’t allowed to ruin other children’s delusions at school. But, rather than raising a liar by humouring the other kids, they told him that if the other kids ever brought it up to ignore them. And if the other kids asked him, to tell them that his family doesn’t believe in Christmas or Santa, that the other students at his school were well within their right to continue believing in all that, but it just wasn’t something his household entertained. He remembered this because he was told to say the same thing when the schools brought in religious education. When Chuck asked why he had to say it in this particular way and why he could just trll them that Santa wasn’t real, his mother explained to him. \n“Remember when your father told the Johnsons that there was no god and he nearly got his ass beat?” She asked rhetorically. \n“Yeah?” Chuck replied.\n“They were pretty mad that he was telling them that their belief was wrong. It didn’t matter if he was right, they didn’t like to hear him telling it. And that’s exactly how the kids and the parents of those kids will likely feel if you tell them about Christmas.” Despite being 10, Chuck understood this and did as he was told. \nHe was, however still teased. The other children rubbed it in his face that they all got two presents. But once they found out he didn’t believe in Santa Claus, they called him The Grinch. A fairly simple-minded tale made into a few less intelligent movie adaptations. The concept alone was preposterous to Chuck; a story about a person who hates Christmas is regarded as a Christmas staple? That’d be like calling Psycho a family film. Nevertheless, Norman Bates was a more welcome face in House Redman than Jim Carrey’s in any Grinch related entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Psycho, because Chuck was able to identify and distinguish the difference between fantasy and reality at such a young age, he also started getting more into horror films. Mr and Mrs Redman justified that if nothing of the supernatural was tangibly real, then nothing could potentially scare him. And he took to them pretty well. Ghosts, goblins, vampires, werewolves, they were all fair game. Everything except serial killer movies, which Chuck had to steal from his dads personal stash or forge a note to blockbuster saying it was ok for him to rent out. He also watched a lot of professional wrestling. Despite the fact that his parents laid out the truth about everything fairly, his father had the curious belief that all WWE wrestling was real. Although “real” wouldn’t quite be the word. Chuck would tell him over and over that it was fake and his father would always correct him by saying “It’s not fake, it’s choreographed. There’s a difference.” As he tried to rack his little seven year old brain around what the word “choreographed” meant, his dad explained to him that while staged, pre rehearsed, planned out, there would be times where wrestlers would actually get hurt. This didn’t matter to Chuck though, because he still enjoyed wrestling all the same. Particularly the Christmas wrestling period, called “Season’s Beatings” which seemed to be the only other extra curricular Christmas activity he enjoyed with his father.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Other than the wrestling, Chuck pretty much had free range of what he could watch during the festive season. His parents even encouraged it. Under one proviso. He could watch anything except traditional Christmas movies. More specifically, bad Christmas movies. Ones that Hollywood decided to make when they saw how much money could be beaten out of that dead reindeer. \nThe kind of slop where the studios thought &lt;em&gt;it’s not enough to release movie after movie all with the same basic plot points. We have to run it into the ground, with only a few different actors and slight variations of the same old Christmas pun titles to tell them apart.&lt;/em&gt; Those feel good, kumbaya singing romance movies with shots that look like they’ve been pulled straight from a Christmas card and airing on a channel literally called Hallmark. Those ones where Ebenezer Scrooge has to go through a whole redemption arc purely because he treated people exactly how they treated him for his entire life. The Redmans saw this as corporate greed masquerading as pure sap to manipulate their audience into keeping their busiest season alive. And that they would continue to do this until the money would eventually run out and these companies, with their best intentions, would go back to making greeting cards that sell for $5 a pop.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But if that wasn’t enough, these types of films started invading other genres. Christmas comedies were popular, Christmas sci-fis were rare but they still happened, and maybe even the odd Mel Gibson film would throw its hat in the ring. But the second most popular Christmas hybrid down from comedy is horror, another thing that Chuck would regularly enjoy. “Gremlins”, “Jack Frost” (the slasher one), “Christmas Evil”, Black Christmas (even though it was a little boring) and, of course the “Silent Night, Deadly Night” films. Usually when he tried to invite the other kids in his class around for his birthday, most of them were too afraid to show up, and those that expressed interest were eventually told they weren’t allowed to because their family was leaving town that week for the holidays. So Chuck’s birthdays were very lonely for a good while. Almost to the point if routine. He went to dinner dinner with his extended family, had a cake afterwards, then went home to bed where he would watch a movie and pass out. Rinse and repeat. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it wasn’t until high school where he actually found friends who truly appreciated his birthday and, more importantly, himself as a person. He got into a eclectic group of outsiders, a who’s who of “who cares” in the school. They were a ragtag bunch consisting of Parker, Harold, Rupert, Frank, Janey and Chuck. They loathed the idea of Christmas and even thought the concept of using organised religion, no matter which, as an excuse to spend time with people you don’t like once a year to be, in their words “a spastic concept.” These were the best years of Chuck’s life, because he finally saw people that were just like him. It wasn’t exactly a friendship deal breaker if they did celebrate Christmas, but it did make him feel less depressed. He was terrified of getting older and the thought of being alone for his birthday got worse and worse as he approached the end of his teens. \nJaney, being the only girl, was especially nice to him. He even developed a crush on her, but never made a move out of fear that either the other guys had the same intentions, or they would make fun of him because the thought of dating her would be like dating your sister. Chuck, being an only child, didn’t understand the feeling of that but he took Parker, the group roughian, at his word.\nIt was during his graduating year, where he felt truly himself. For his birthday he decided to do something on Christmas Eve. There  he invited the group over to his house where they all got drunk, had a couple of doobies, and went down to their local church to attend the midnight mass. Up to a hundred god botherers or otherwise tradition seeking men and women happened to find six jokers, in typical ill-behaved fashion, sitting in the back row, all wearing matching religious choir outfits and giggling away. It wasn’t until the hymn part of the ceremony where they were kicked out for singing in purposely annoying, over-the-top falsetto voices and then slapping their knees and each other as if it were feeding time in the monkey enclosure. When the reverend asked them to leave, Frank or Parker pointed to the ceramic baby Jesus and yelled “He sees you when you’re sleeping, you know!” before abruptly leaving. \nAfter this riotous affair, they walked down to a nearby playground, where they finished off the rest of their drinks. Wondering what they were going to do now that they’ve graduated. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A couple months later came Harold’s birthday, in mid April. Harold, foolish arrogant Harold, always had to be mister attention and mother superior in the group. Chuck stressed to him over several arguments throughout the years that he couldn’t be both roles, he had to pick one so that he wouldn’t be called a tyrant. Harold didn’t care, if there was something he had to say, he was going to say it whether you liked it or not. He seemed unimpressed that Chuck wasn’t getting any employment, nor was he trying to seek further education by going to community college… at the very least. Chuck kept his cool throughout this ordeal, but he spent the whole time thinking “Youre a good friend Harold, but you’re a 60 year old in a 19 year old kid’s body. If I ever end up like you, I would end it.” So Chuck gritted his teeth, grinned and tolerated it for an hour, then finally discreetly said goodbye to Janey before leaving without notifying anyone else. That was the last time all of Chuck’s friends were in the same vicinity as each other.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It seemed so unexpected to Chuck. An inevitable fate that one cannot change. Like being in a train wreck and still travelling up to back despite every hauling you to your doom. Everyone just … drifted away from each other. It started off small, where one of them would get a casual job somewhere, and they wouldn’t see them for weeks, then another and another. Chuck kept in touch with everyone on social media but he just couldn’t get the band back together, but not for lack of trying. He tried organising something for his birthday every year. He saw it as an excuse to have a mini reunion. For that, he usually asked them, his family, friends of family. He even invited some of his co workers at the job his social worker scored for him, just a supermarket, nothing too crazy. \nAt first he tried to organise something on his actual birthday, to which most of the responses were a resounding no. They had their work Christmas parties to go to, they ran out of time, the holiday season has been so busy this year. Stuff like that. \nThen he started changing the date to New Year’s Eve, so that way it could be a double celebration, while also a way for them not to use the Christmas excuse. Again, most of his friends declined, reasoning that they spent &lt;em&gt;too much&lt;/em&gt; money on Christmas and decided that, if they did something on new years, going out or catching up would be too overwhelming for them; they wanted to keep theirs lowkey. Some of them dropped off entirely. The only people that had legitimate excuses were his co workers who had to continue to go to work. His boss didn’t believe in having work Christmas parties, he thought they were a waste of time and money, something that Chuck couldn’t fault him for, and one of the only reasons he kept working there for as long as he did. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What happened to hos friends, he thought. What happened to the guys he went to school who thought that Christmas was an outdated concept and it was better to be edgy. And now they had become the thing that laughed at. He was starting to get a little jealous of the holiday season. He stopped calling it Christmas years ago, it was now the holiday season for him. \nHere his friends were, telling him year after year that they had Christmas parties to go to. As if the mere act of not attending the non obligational work Christmas outing would result in them being fired. He spent days thinking about it every year. Working himself up and convincing himself that soulless companies are letting their employees brown nose them, that they imply that they would would make things very difficult for employees if they backed out of the sacred, precious Christmas party. Then Chuck started cursing god. He must’ve said to a 100 people over the years that “What this says to me is that if Jesus were a real person who is living and breathing today, my friends would rather go to &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; birthday party than to mine.” When he first exclaimed it, it was really just a joke… a funny but dry observation. But the more he kept saying it, the more conviction was heard in his voice. He just didn’t understand it… why do people spend months preparing for a one day event that will be over couple of hours in. Seemed like such a waste when there were more important things going on in the world. This is what he told himself. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seven years after the Harold party and Chuck was approaching two years at his work. Things were going fairly decently. He was acing his job, he had moved out of his parents home, he even felt less depressed about the way things were going. As long as he put the holidays out of his head. But then it happened. The manager had decided to put on Christmas songs on the store intercom radio. He couldn’t believe his ears. In September? Then he noticed Christmas ware l being brought out. When he approached his boss about why they had it all out so early, his boss gave him a very reasonable answer. All the other retail stores don’t put things up until October, and he wanted to get a jump on the sales stranglehold. When Chuck argued that he thought the boss didn’t celebrate Christmas, the boss countered this with it “doesn’t matter what I like. It’s what the customers like, and if you don’t like that, go somewhere else.” And for three straight months it was the same playlist of Christmas music, the same time every day. Chuck could’ve set his clock to when a certain song would come on any time of the day. This coupled with the blaring fluorescent lights shining down on him was a recipe for disaster. He was convinced that his boss was doing it to spite him, making it louder and quieter every day during graveyard hours when he knew Chuck was there. Chuck thought his miserable superior was doing it purely out of hatred towards Chuck for having the mere brass to question his power. And then one day, Chuck couldn’t believe it. It must’ve been a joke. The same Christmas song, stuck on a loop, repeating itself over and over for hours. Chuck was gobsmacked, astounded. He believed that his control hungry overlord had gone mad with power. Acting like some kind of religious leader, looking down on all of his worker monkeys. Watching the cashiers grinning like idiots while secretly paranoid that they’re going to get their hours cut if they take their fake deer antlers off. Chuck thought that this false deity who calls himself the checkout king was looking down at his loyal subjects, rewarding those who get with the program, and smiting those who resist. That song was meant to be on repeat, just to annoy him; and annoy him, it did. He had only gotten to the fourth hour into his shift before he snapped, decided that this wasn’t worth $20 an hour. So he took off all his work accessories, kicked over a few shelves, watching them scatter to the floor and walked out. It turned out that there was a glitch in the sound system, the boss wasn’t even there that day to fix the error. But that didn’t matter, the damage was already done and Chuck was fired. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;With no job and facing eviction from his rental, Chuck faced the prospect of moving back in with his parents. Fortunately, he was still able to live at his current cheap, shabby love palace until after new years. So Chuck wanted to see how all of his friends were going, maybe to catch up for his birthday, one last hurrah while he had the place. He still had all the old gang on either Facebook or Snapchat, but he never really looked into what their life was now like. They all looked they were happy, thriving. He thought that maybe they had forgotten all about each other, maybe he wasn’t the only one that felt left in the cold. But it was then that he noticed. Janey, now important and respectable “Jane” had tagged people in her photos. Dinner pictures, vacation albums, holiday portraits, various posts that had one or more members in the friend group in attendance. There were even half a dozen photos over the seven years where all of them were together, in the same picture, attending the same event. Everybody except Chuck. So out of a mixture of fear and spite, instead of addressing it to any one of them, he created a Facebook event and a subsequent message group with the intent of catching up. \nThis took everyone by surprise. A mixture of confusion and fond memories. Harold, always the-holier-than-thou, left the group immediately. But that didn’t bother Chuck. His plan was to have everyone come over for beer, snacks and maybe pizza. Just like old times, but preferably without Harold sticking his rude head in and bringing the party down. Even if no one but Janey showed up would be fine by him. That could’ve been the most ideal situation. He just needed this to happen, without any form of holiday taking control of their decision. So he did everything he could to de-holiday his party, to not remind people of other obligations that didn’t involve him. He even triple checked the music to make sure nothing seasonal would come through. But sooner or later, Mariah Carey would creep in. That was a fact. It didn’t matter where he went, what he put on, she was following him. Waiting until the time was right to strike. And she would not stop. She was like a Christmas version of the terminator.\nAfter Harold, Rupert also dropped out early but at least he had the decency of making an excuse. No total loss, Chuck wasn’t overly fond of Rupert either. That left Parker, Frank and Janey swearing black and blue that they would go. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But Chuck’s big day arrived and with every passing hour after the designated time, he was sending more and more frantic messages. Not trying to make himself sound desperate, he sounded aloof about it, and one would think he was, were it not for the frequency of almost spam level messages. Chuck then looked to confirm the one thing that he’d been avoiding the whole night, confirming the one thing he was afraid of. He checked every single one of his friend’s stories and saw that everyone but Janey, posted videos of them at their work Christmas parties. Again, he had to hide his frustration with casualness. He messaged the group that if they still wanted something to do after their Christmas parties, he would still be around if they wanted to swing by. This blunt but contextually hostile message was taken to be a little bit overbearing for Parker and Frank, who were growing concerned that Chuck was keeping tabs on them. They both left the message group after seeing it. \nBy this point, Chuck was in such shock that all these people had done this to him that, to hell with them, he didn’t need them at all. He still had Janey coming. That’s right… Janey. Sweet, lovely, reliable Janey. That was when Janey messaged him privately, an hour later. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;She hadn’t seen the chaos that happened in the group chat yet, because she told him that she couldn’t make it “but have fun and Merry Christmas.” She followed it up with the statement that she hoped that the others were there and could fill in for her. He knew she must’ve been telling the truth so he told her to check the message group. She did, and after that… he didn’t hear from her for the rest of the night. He didn’t know if this was a defence mechanism, fear of how she would be perceived if the other guys saw this, or if it was second hand embarrassment seeing how badly it all blew up. But she went cold. Leaving him to keep reading her private message, looking for clues. He kept re reading that last line. &lt;em&gt;”Have fun and Merry Christmas.”&lt;/em&gt; Then it occurred to him. To confirm another thing that he really didn’t want to have to confirm. None of them wished him Happy Birthday, the very reason that they were going to catch up with him in the first place. Not a call, not a text, not even a social media post. He decided that this was the last straw. What was the point in living if everyone had forgotten who you are? So he decided he wasn’t going to keep on living, he would end it all. So he swallowed a bunch of pills, called an ambulance to say that he’d taken too many (just to give himself that slight chance of getting out of it) and waited by the phone until he slipped away into a beautiful godless nothing. An abyss of emptiness. Smiling, he passed out…&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Two days later, he woke up. When he opened his eyes he saw that he was in a hospital room. An empty room with nothing but his clothes hanging on a rack, and something resting on the hospital table right beside him.\nFeeling like death and looking worse, Chuck buzzed a nurse in. She told him he was lucky. When he asked what she meant, she told him when they drove over to help him it was considered one of the least busy times during the holiday season in at least 20 years. They were hitting every green light along the way. She told him that someone was looking out for him.\nThis was the last thing that Chuck wanted to hear. He spent his whole life as a passionate atheist, and only when he’s on the precipice of death does God want to pull the rug out from under him? According to Chuck, nobody saved his life; they merely prevented his death. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;He didn’t want to argue with the nurse so he smiled politely and told her he was going to get more sleep. When she left he seemed disappointed. He was expecting balloons, flowers, notes, giant bears, anything that told him that someone was worried about him. Before the botched attempt of his life, Chuck really truly did want to die. But a small part at the back of his mind thought &lt;em&gt;I hope they find about this!&lt;/em&gt; Although he was surprised to discover he was still alive, he just couldn’t accept the fact that he wasn’t in anyone’s thoughts or prayers. There was nothing, just one card on a table. &lt;em&gt;Wait a minute,&lt;/em&gt; he thought. Yes, the card. It was open with some of the best penmanship he’d ever seen, handwriting that he recognised. It was a card from Janey.\n“Dear Chuck,” it read. “I’m still trying to wrap my head around this as much as I can but I still don’t believe it. Give me a call when you wake up and we can talk. Only if you feel comfortable. You’re not alone in the world. - Jane”\nUnderneath she wrote, “Get well soon!” Chuck was touched. He felt this was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for him. A wash of emotion flooded him. This was short lived once he closed the card. For some odd reason in Chuck’s mind, he wanted to see what was on the front of the card. And when he closed it, he could already feel his hands getting tense. What he saw on the card was a picture of Santa Claus flying his sleigh over a street of houses. It wasn’t a birthday card, it wasn’t a get well soon card, it was a Christmas card. As his eyes tensed on this card, his hands curled up into balls as he felt the cards crunching into his hands, crudely compressing as his arms were shaking with pure rage. Eventually he let go and the card fell to the floor. The one person he thought gave a shit about him made no effort this time; the most important time. What would’ve been, were it not for his failed life attempt, his last time. Suddenly depression turned to rage, desparate emptiness to burning wrath. He decided that he would no longer sit by and watch his friends walk all over him. He decided something must be done. He turned over in bed where he fell silent. He didn’t talk again for three weeks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Because of his scare that landed him in hospital, Chuck’s parents decided that it would be best if he were put into a mental health resort. This, to Chuck, was just a fancy term for a minimum security institution. He stayed there for a few months saying very little, watching the wrestling, and planning out what he was going to do. This time next year, he was going to kill all of his friends. He kept that one to himself though, because it seemed obvious to him that saying his plans out loud quote unquote “causes concern”. But they were his plans nonetheless. He deemed it was only fitting… being around Christmas a punishing the bad. So set out to follow them for a whole year… to to see if they were being naughty or nice. As Chuck began researching for this dreadful holiday, or what he called “knowing thy enemy” he found that more kids got punished in the 19th and 20th centuries. It wasn’t enough that a kid learnt his lesson in not being a little ass on Christmas, Santa wanted him to feel in every bone why he made a very bad choice. And some of the methods were extreme beyond all measures. Chuck was beginning to like this aspect of Christmas lore. It seemed to him, these days, that kids were more spoilt than ever. There were weak willed parents out there giving in to their kids’ every demand, either because they were too much of a soft touch that these brats exploited or they just caved into submission just to make them shut up. Whatever happened to punishment? Whatever happened to karma? And it wasn’t just kids either. Every single one of Chuck’s friends did him dirty. Even Janey. So they all needed to be punished. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But not Janey. No. He couldn’t bring himself to get her… but at the same time he could show all this to her, to make her learn the consequences of one’s actions. Suddenly it was all making sense to him now. Why he liked Christmas horror, why he liked WWE’s Season’s Beatings. It spoke to him, this voice. It told him that there sick degenerates out there treating people unfairly and thinking they can get away with it. Who? &lt;em&gt;Work Christmas Parties.&lt;/em&gt; Of course. It was obvious to Chuck. As long as these damn things existed it will never stop for him. This was his villainous challenger. Like every \nWWE show there was always an over the top corporation they go after as a challenger, and Work Christmas Parties seemed like the perfect challenger arc.  &lt;em&gt;Who needs the Bible when you have that?&lt;/em&gt; he thought as he prepared. &lt;em&gt;These are the things they should be teaching in school.&lt;/em&gt; Punish the deserving, spare the innocent.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

ILAAC emerged as an affirming, artist-led collective committed to visibility, solidarity, and creative sovereignty.\n* This exhibition brings together a group of voices shaped by migration, memory, and joy. The works on display arise from a moment when communities were navigating profound challenges and the quiet weight carried by those living between cultures. Yet despite this – or perhaps because of it – the artists here choose to create. Our practices push back against despair and insist on tenderness, imagination, and collective care because they deserve spaces of joy.\n* This event is free and open to the public.

The Inter Latin American Artist Collective (ILAAC) was founded on a simple but urgent belief: that Latin American artists in North Carolina and the South deserve spaces where their stories, identities, and creative visions can flourish without limitation. ILAAC emerged as an affirming, artist-led collective committed to visibility, solidarity, and creative sovereignty.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This exhibition brings together a group of voices shaped by migration, memory, and joy. The works on display arise from a moment when communities were navigating profound challenges and the quiet weight carried by those living between cultures. Yet despite this – or perhaps because of it – the artists here choose to create. Our practices push back against despair and insist on tenderness, imagination, and collective care because they deserve spaces of joy.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;This event is free and open to the public. There will be light fare, drinks and a public craft to create luminaires. The Durham Art Guild, in the adjacent Truist Gallery will also be celebrating the opening of their 71st Annual Juried Members show.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Friday, December 19&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;6 pm&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/3rd-friday-mix-mingle/\"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3rd Friday: Mix &amp;amp; Mingle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Zeitgeist Gallery &amp;amp; Bar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s 3rd Friday at Zeitgeist!

It is a Brutalist style piece with very deep carved lines and intentionally rough texture. As many of you know, these are valuable and collectible, so my primary goal is the absolute safety of the object.\n\n**Context:** I did ceramics throughout college, but I haven't fired a kiln in over a decade. This restoration plan seems plausible to me based on my past experience, but since my knowledge is rusty, I wanted to sanity check it with a more expert community before I approach a local studio to rent space.\n\n**The Problem:** It was previously painted with a black paint (assumed acrylic/latex). Over the last week, I have chemically stripped it and mechanically scrubbed it about 4 times.\n\n**The Chemical**: I used a commercial stripper (a soy solvent - not the harshest stuff on the market, but effective). The lamp has been rinsed and washed numerous times since any chemical last touched it, so it is clean to the touch.\n\n**The Grooves**: Because of the deep, rough Brutalist texture, the paint is mechanically locked into the pores. I have hit a wall where solvents and scrubbing just aren't moving the final residue.\n\n**The \"Blue Cast\"**: Currently, the carved areas have an incredibly noticeable blue cast from the remains of the paint that are locked into the deep recesses of the clay. I have included photos of a similar Martz lamp in its original state—you can see the grooves should be a natural warm clay tone, not this blue-grey.\n\n**Original Finish:** The lamp was certainly fired to a high temperature (since this is not my work, I couldn't tell you what that was. It's not just a bisque firing) and is decorated on the higher areas with what i assume to be an iron oxide wash.\n\n\n\n**What I’ve Done So Far:**\n\n**Stripped &amp; Scrubbed**: 99% of the bulk material is gone.\n\n**Poultice Attempt**: Tried Hydrogen Peroxide + Baking Soda to lift the shadow. Minimal effect.\n\n**Desalination**: I am currently running it through wet/dry cycles to ensure all baking soda/salts are leached out of the pores so I don't introduce flux to the kiln.\n\n**The Torch Test (Important)**: I took a micro-torch to a small section of the \"blue\" area. The shadow burned off instantly and cleanly, returning the clay to its natural warm color. This suggests the residue is organic carbon (soot/bone black), not a metallic stain.\n\n**The Proposed Plan**: Since I can't scrub the shadow out of these deep grooves, I want to oxidize it out to kill that blue cast. I am planning to ask a studio for a Cone 017 (1350°F) firing. My logic is that this is hot enough to turn the carbon to CO2, but low enough to minimize thermal shock on the vintage ware.\n\n**The Proposed Schedule**: I want to be super conservative to protect the piece.\n\nSegment 1: Hold at 180°F for 4 hours (Candling to ensure absolute dryness since it was washed).\n\nSegment 2: Ramp 100°F/hr to 1100°F (Slow ramp with ventilation for any off-gassing).\n\nSegment 3: Ramp 150°F/hr to 1350°F (Cone 017) -&gt; Hold 20-30 mins.\n\nSegment 4: Natural Cool.\n\n\n\n**My Questions for the Experts**:\n\nIs Cone 017 the sweet spot? Is this high enough to ensure carbon burnout in deep texture, or should I go lower (Cone 018/019) or higher?\n\nRisk to the Kiln? Since the bulk paint is gone and it's just a \"shadow\" in the pores, is the risk to elements/shelves negligible with proper venting?\n\nThermal Shock: Does that ramp speed look safe for a vintage piece that has already been fired once in its life?\n\n\n\n[How the lamp looked when I purchased it. I was convinced the lamp was just simply glazed in black, but when I looked closer I started to notice brush strokes...](https://preview.redd.it/5rbatmdwt17g1.jpg?width=3472&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=922bcb9e25eabd55cb8ef1b0ef0b6667778a2859)\n\n[This is a similar piece with the same treatment. The carved away areas should be a normal stoneware tan color.](https://preview.redd.it/czlb19j1u17g1.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=456c27927de4b53b182f85b9a78d9801d0650fe0)\n\n[And here is my smurf-looking lamp base.](https://preview.redd.it/rwlmqw0eu17g1.jpg?width=4992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01d625f7c53d3a89a7d97e427768235a310382b1)\n\n[There is still some tiny amounts of paint left in all of the deepest grooves and pores.](https://preview.redd.it/mae9dtueu17g1.jpg?width=4992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2cb9416bf9280a5f3200bdbddc43a06e715c7417)\n\n[Areas like the base where the clay was more compressed have returned to their original color very easily](https://preview.redd.it/82yruouju17g1.jpg?width=4992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=63d390d36dc5b503dcc4e8b09e239a3145672e77)\n\n[Difficult to see here - but the carved areas on top had less deep grooves \\/ holes and have nearly returned to the original color](https://preview.redd.it/umgg1e1qu17g1.jpg?width=4992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58807618fb077c136daa35151f5a861eb9d23d61)\n\nI appreciate any help I can get on if this is a reasonable plan!  \n",

It is a Brutalist style piece with very deep carved lines and intentionally rough texture. As many of you know, these are valuable and collectible, so my primary goal is the absolute safety of the object.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Context:&lt;/strong&gt; I did ceramics throughout college, but I haven&amp;#39;t fired a kiln in over a decade. This restoration plan seems plausible to me based on my past experience, but since my knowledge is rusty, I wanted to sanity check it with a more expert community before I approach a local studio to rent space.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; It was previously painted with a black paint (assumed acrylic/latex). Over the last week, I have chemically stripped it and mechanically scrubbed it about 4 times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Chemical&lt;/strong&gt;: I used a commercial stripper (a soy solvent - not the harshest stuff on the market, but effective). The lamp has been rinsed and washed numerous times since any chemical last touched it, so it is clean to the touch.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Grooves&lt;/strong&gt;: Because of the deep, rough Brutalist texture, the paint is mechanically locked into the pores. I have hit a wall where solvents and scrubbing just aren&amp;#39;t moving the final residue.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &amp;quot;Blue Cast&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;: Currently, the carved areas have an incredibly noticeable blue cast from the remains of the paint that are locked into the deep recesses of the clay. I have included photos of a similar Martz lamp in its original state—you can see the grooves should be a natural warm clay tone, not this blue-grey.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Original Finish:&lt;/strong&gt; The lamp was certainly fired to a high temperature (since this is not my work, I couldn&amp;#39;t tell you what that was. It&amp;#39;s not just a bisque firing) and is decorated on the higher areas with what i assume to be an iron oxide wash.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What I’ve Done So Far:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stripped &amp;amp; Scrubbed&lt;/strong&gt;: 99% of the bulk material is gone.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poultice Attempt&lt;/strong&gt;: Tried Hydrogen Peroxide + Baking Soda to lift the shadow. Minimal effect.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desalination&lt;/strong&gt;: I am currently running it through wet/dry cycles to ensure all baking soda/salts are leached out of the pores so I don&amp;#39;t introduce flux to the kiln.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Torch Test (Important)&lt;/strong&gt;: I took a micro-torch to a small section of the &amp;quot;blue&amp;quot; area. The shadow burned off instantly and cleanly, returning the clay to its natural warm color. This suggests the residue is organic carbon (soot/bone black), not a metallic stain.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Proposed Plan&lt;/strong&gt;: Since I can&amp;#39;t scrub the shadow out of these deep grooves, I want to oxidize it out to kill that blue cast. I am planning to ask a studio for a Cone 017 (1350°F) firing. My logic is that this is hot enough to turn the carbon to CO2, but low enough to minimize thermal shock on the vintage ware.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Proposed Schedule&lt;/strong&gt;: I want to be super conservative to protect the piece.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Segment 1: Hold at 180°F for 4 hours (Candling to ensure absolute dryness since it was washed).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Segment 2: Ramp 100°F/hr to 1100°F (Slow ramp with ventilation for any off-gassing).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Segment 3: Ramp 150°F/hr to 1350°F (Cone 017) -&amp;gt; Hold 20-30 mins.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Segment 4: Natural Cool.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Questions for the Experts&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is Cone 017 the sweet spot? Is this high enough to ensure carbon burnout in deep texture, or should I go lower (Cone 018/019) or higher?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Risk to the Kiln? Since the bulk paint is gone and it&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;shadow&amp;quot; in the pores, is the risk to elements/shelves negligible with proper venting?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thermal Shock: Does that ramp speed look safe for a vintage piece that has already been fired once in its life?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/5rbatmdwt17g1.jpg?width=3472&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=922bcb9e25eabd55cb8ef1b0ef0b6667778a2859\"&gt;How the lamp looked when I purchased it. I was convinced the lamp was just simply glazed in black, but when I looked closer I started to notice brush strokes...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/czlb19j1u17g1.jpg?width=1500&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=456c27927de4b53b182f85b9a78d9801d0650fe0\"&gt;This is a similar piece with the same treatment. The carved away areas should be a normal stoneware tan color.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/rwlmqw0eu17g1.jpg?width=4992&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=01d625f7c53d3a89a7d97e427768235a310382b1\"&gt;And here is my smurf-looking lamp base.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/mae9dtueu17g1.jpg?width=4992&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=2cb9416bf9280a5f3200bdbddc43a06e715c7417\"&gt;There is still some tiny amounts of paint left in all of the deepest grooves and pores.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/82yruouju17g1.jpg?width=4992&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=63d390d36dc5b503dcc4e8b09e239a3145672e77\"&gt;Areas like the base where the clay was more compressed have returned to their original color very easily&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://preview.redd.it/umgg1e1qu17g1.jpg?width=4992&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=58807618fb077c136daa35151f5a861eb9d23d61\"&gt;Difficult to see here - but the carved areas on top had less deep grooves / holes and have nearly returned to the original color&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I appreciate any help I can get on if this is a reasonable plan!  &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
