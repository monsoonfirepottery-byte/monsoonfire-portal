# 30-day GA optimization roadmap (priority execution plan)

Status: Proposed
Priority: P1
Severity: Sev2
Component: website
Impact: high
Tags: website, roadmap, analytics, conversion

## Goal
Within 30 days, stabilize measurement, identify top drop-offs, and ship 3 high-confidence conversion experiments with full reporting.

## Sprint 1 (Days 1-7): Measurement stabilizer
- Deliver:
  - `P1-website-ga-data-package-template-and-access.md`
  - `P1-website-ga-event-and-goal-instrumentation-completeness.md`
  - `P1-website-ga-campaign-and-source-quality.md`
- DoD:
  - Canonical event/goal mapping approved
  - Campaign tags standardized for active outbound traffic
  - Baseline report in shared location

## Sprint 2 (Days 8-14): Funnel recovery
- Deliver:
  - `P2-website-ga-funnel-friction-and-conversion-drops.md`
  - `P2-website-ga-experiment-backlog-and-prioritization.md`
  - Execute top 1–2 funnel experiments
- DoD:
  - Top drop-off steps named with intervention owners
  - Interim impact tracking started
  - One hypothesis closed with direction decision

## Sprint 3 (Days 15-21): Content and trust polish
- Deliver:
  - `P2-website-ga-content-and-engagement-polish.md`
  - Additional experiment cycles for top 2 ranked opportunities
- DoD:
  - At least 4 pages updated with measurable objective
  - Mobile and desktop deltas documented

## Sprint 4 (Days 22-30): Operating rhythm lock
- Deliver:
  - `P2-website-ga-dashboard-alerts-and-handover.md`
  - Final readout deck and next-quarter backlog
- DoD:
  - Weekly reporting process started
  - Alert thresholds signed off by owner
  - 30-day comparison posted with wins, losses, and next actions

## Risk register
- GA access lag or permission limits.
- Inconsistent event schema between pages.
- Seasonal traffic distortion in first two weeks.
- Cross-team coordination delays on content/design changes.

## Escalation and owner mapping
- Lead analytics: owns KPI definitions and weekly report.
- Marketing lead: owns campaign tagging and source quality.
- Web/content lead: owns copy/design experiments.
- Product lead: owns final scope and go/no-go decision.

## Success metrics by day 30
- +10% confidence in funnel coverage (measured by event completeness against top 3 funnels).
- Identified top 3 conversion blockers with assigned owners.
- Executed at least 2 high-confidence experiments.
- Clear go-forward backlog with quantized expected lift.
