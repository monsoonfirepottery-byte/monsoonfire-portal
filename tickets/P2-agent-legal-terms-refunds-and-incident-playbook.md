# P2 — Agent Legal Terms, Refund Rules, and Incident Playbook

**Status:** Open

## Problem
- Agent-only commerce requires explicit legal terms and operational response procedures.
- Refund/dispute ambiguity creates financial and reputational risk.

## Goals
- Publish agent-specific terms, acceptable-use policy, and refund/cancel rules.
- Define incident playbooks for abuse, legal takedowns, and payment fraud.

## Scope
- Terms versioning and acceptance requirement for agent access.
- Refund matrix by service type and fulfillment stage.
- Incident runbooks with severity ladder and kill-switch criteria.

## Security
- Enforce terms acceptance at API gateway.
- Preserve evidence logs for disputes and legal review.
- Restrict incident controls to staff roles.

## Acceptance
- Agent endpoints require current terms acceptance.
- Refund flows map to documented policy states.
- Incident response can be executed end-to-end by staff.
