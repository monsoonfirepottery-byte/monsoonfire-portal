# P2 — Sprint 10/11 Gap Cleanup Tickets

Status: Blocked
Date: 2026-02-18
Priority: P2
Owner: PM + Engineering
Type: Ticket
Parent Epic: tickets/P1-EPIC-06-backlog-hygiene-and-ticket-topology.md

## Problem
Sprint 10 and Sprint 11 docs still contain goals that are no longer clearly tracked against the live ticket set.

## Objective
Normalize sprint 10 and sprint 11 gaps into this ticket hierarchy and preserve continuity.

## Scope
1. Compare sprint docs with the active ticket file set.
2. Promote unresolved high-priority items into explicit tickets.
3. Add parent/child links and ordering labels.

## Tasks
1. Review `docs/sprints/SPRINT_10_ALPHA_LAUNCH.md` and `docs/sprints/SPRINT_11_PERF_TESTING.md`.
2. Add parent ticket mapping file for sprint-specific cleanup.
3. Publish sequencing notes for backlog dependency ordering.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Sprint notes reference current ticket IDs for all open priorities.
2. No high-priority Sprint 10/11 gap is orphaned from this new structure.
3. Stakeholder review confirms ordering and ownership.

## Blocker Notes (2026-02-22)
1. Blocked by execution directive for this pass: ignore Epic/Sprint 10 and 11 associated scope.
2. No Sprint 10/11 reconciliation changes were applied in this run.
3. Unblock by explicit approval to process Sprint 10/11 backlog normalization.
