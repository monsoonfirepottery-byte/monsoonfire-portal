# Website GA content and engagement polish

Status: Proposed
Priority: P2
Severity: Sev3
Component: website
Impact: medium
Tags: website, engagement, content, analytics

## Problem statement
Pages with high time-on-page or low bounce may not be turning into action, and pages with low traffic may have untapped organic potential.

## Proposed solution
Use GA behavior insights to tune content, discoverability, and mobile engagement.

## Tasks
1. Segment by device class for all top-traffic pages.
1. Identify pages with:
   - high entrances + low conversion
   - high bounce + high impressions (SEO opportunity)
   - short engagement + high repeat visits
1. Create a prioritized content optimization queue for the top 10 pages.
1. Add or improve internal links, trust blocks, and next-step affordances on 1-to-2 high-value pages per cycle.
1. Add structured metadata updates for pages with repeated search demand but low click-through.

## Acceptance criteria
- A ranked list of top 10 opportunity pages is published.
- For each page, there is one change tied to measured objective (CTR, conversion, or engagement).
- Mobile-specific recommendations are captured separately from desktop.
- No content page is edited without updated metadata and alt-text checks if applicable.

## Dependencies
- SEO/Content ownership for homepage, services, and portfolio pages.
- Access to behavior reports and metadata files.

## Manual test checklist
1. Confirm metadata edits are reflected in page source and rendering.
1. Verify mobile usability changes do not regress core layout.
1. Compare pre/post GA signal trends after 14 days.
