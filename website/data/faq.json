    "question": "How do I estimate how many half shelves I need?",
    "answer": "<p>If your work fits laid flat inside a carry-on, that is about one half shelf. Tall pieces need clearance; handles and irregular shapes take extra room; stacks (like plates) are more efficient. When in doubt, ask and we will help size it.</p>",
